However, inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the neural mechanisms of acupuncture at ST36. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nTo perform a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on acupuncture at ST36 to assess the brain atlas of acupuncture at ST36 from available studies. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nBased on a preregistered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42019119553), a large set of databases was searched up to August 9, 2021, without language restrictions. Peak coordinates were extracted from clusters that showed significant signal differences before and after acupuncture treatment. A meta-analysis was performed using seed-based d mapping with permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI), a newly improved meta-analytic method. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 27 studies (27 ST36) were included. This meta-analysis found that ST36 could activate the left cerebellum, the bilateral Rolandic operculum, the right supramarginal gyrus, and the right cerebellum. Functional characterizations showed that acupuncture at ST36 was mainly associated with action and perception. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results provide a brain atlas for acupuncture at ST36, which, besides offering a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms, also provides the possibility of future precision therapies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment that involves inserting needles into specific acupuncture points to treat disease and has been practiced in East Asian countries for over 2000\u2009years. A recent review of the high-quality evidence-based medical literature reveals that acupuncture could improve the functional communication of patients with post-stroke aphasia, relieve neck and shoulder pain and non-specific lower back pain, reduce the severity of vascular dementia symptoms, and improve the nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( ). Currently, acupuncture is widely used around the world, with particular attention being paid to its mechanisms. However, a combination of acupoints has often been used, which makes it difficult to understand the role of specific acupoints. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of individual acupoints for individualized treatment. Stomach 36 (ST36, Zusanli), located 3\u2009cm below the knee joint on the anterior portion of the leg, is a commonly used acupoint and is widely used in clinical practice. Although many animal studies have been conducted to explore the mechanisms of ST36 ( ;  ), the acupoints of animals and humans are different from one another. Thus, it is necessary to further understand its function based on human acupoints. \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an experimental window to observe the human brain ( ). It is not only completely noninvasive but also offers excellent temporal and spatial resolution and improved sensitivity to detect task activation in individual subjects through signal averaging ( ). Indeed, the goal of functional neuroimaging is to map the activity of the living brain in space and time. In the last three decades, a great deal of research has been performed on the application of fMRI to acupuncture ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of fMRI scanning, the sample size of each study is small. In addition, the fMRI results for acupuncture at ST36 were heterogeneous. \n\nTherefore, it is necessary to investigate the brain effect of acupuncture at ST36 based on previously published studies in a quantitative way. We first applied seed-based d mapping with permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI), a new generation algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA), to determine the most prominent and replicable brain areas of the included acupoints. Then, we investigated the functional characterizations and co-activation patterns of significant clusters using behavioral domains, paradigm classes, and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis, respectively. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThe review process followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement ( ), and the meta-analysis protocol was registered with PROSPERO  (registration number: CRD42020204050). \n\n### Selection procedure \n  \n#### Search strategies \n  \nStudies of acupuncture on some acupoints were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from the inception of the databases up to August 2021 to identify relevant studies. The following search terms were used: (\u201cacupuncture\u201d or \u201cacupuncture therapy\u201d or \u201celectroacupuncture\u201d or \u201cEA\u201d) and (\u201czusanli\u201d or \u201cST36\u201d) and (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cBOLD\u201d or \u201cReHo\u201d or \u201cALFF\u201d or \u201cfALFF\u201d) NOT (\u201cmice\u201d or \u201crat\u201d or \u201canimal\u201d). Additional articles were identified by cross-referencing the reference lists of the included articles. \n\n\n#### Selection criteria \n  \nIn this review, we included all studies that used fMRI to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the human brain. To be included in this meta-analysis, research had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) it had to include healthy subjects only; (2) it had to include verum acupuncture only or verum versus sham acupuncture only using task-based fMRI with the whole-brain acquisition; (3) it only needed to report ST36; (4) it reported findings in 3D coordinates in the Montreal Neurological Institute ( ) or Talairach space ( ); (5) it concerned manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture. Studies were excluded if they: (1) examined needling stimulation with tasks, such as finger movement; (2) investigated only region of interest (ROI) results or used functional connectivity, independent component analysis, and graph theory analytical methods; (3) Consisted of reviews, case reports, conferences, abstracts, and animal studies; (4) only included fMRI results between acupuncture and sham acupuncture; (5) had no effective value. \n\n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nTwo researchers manually extracted basic information and the peak voxel coordinates of the included studies, such as first author, year of publication, gender, mean age, number of subjects, field strength, analysis methods, stereoscopic template, and statistical threshold. Any discrepancies were discussed with the third researcher until a consensus was reached. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis procedure \n  \nThis meta-analysis was performed using SDM-PSI version 6.21 ( ). Detailed SDM methods have been described on this website.  First, text files of peak coordinates and effect sizes (e.g.,   t  -values) of fMRI differences between post-treatment and pre-treatment were extracted. During the preprocessing, the lower and upper bounds of the possible effect-size values of the studies were recreated using the above files. Then, the mean map was generated by voxel-wise calculation of the random-effects mean of the study maps, weighted by the sample size, intra-study variability, and between-study heterogeneity. Family-wise error (FWE) correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and voxel extent \u226510) using the threshold-free cluster enhancement approach (TFCE) and 5,000 permutations was initially used. \n\nPeak coordinate values were extracted for heterogeneity statistics and publication bias analyses. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the I2 statistic in a random-effects model, with   I   <\u200950% indicating low heterogeneity ( ). \n\nPublication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger\u2019s tests ( ). An asymmetric plot and   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\nPain-related brain regions were searched,  then common brain regions of activation of ST36 and pain-related brain regions were extracted. \n\nFinally, co-activation pattern analysis and functional characterization were performed as described in detail in a previous study ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nA total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.

The results of the SDM analysis are summarized in   and  . \n  \nBrain regions activated by acupuncture stimulation at ST36 (compared to resting state). \n  \nTFCE Corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n    \n (A)   Brain areas activated by ST36.

Coactivation connectivity of significance levels was thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, corrected for multiple comparisons with FDR. Functional characterization of significance levels was thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using FWE, clustering threshold at voxel-level   p   <\u20090.001. \n  \nIn terms of heterogeneity,   I   (0%) showed little heterogeneity in between-study variability on peak coordinates of ST36. In addition, Egger\u2019s tests indicated no significant publication bias on the peak coordinates of ST36. \n\nIn terms of co-activation patterns and functional characterization, the bilateral cerebral, fusiform, postcentral, and temporal areas were co-activated with ST36 ( , ). Functional characterization showed that the ST36 was mainly associated with action and perception. The PCs showed similar results ( ). \n\n\n### Pain and specific networks \n  \nWe investigated the pain network and non-pain network activation brains of ST36 and found that ST36 can activate pain-related networks including the left cerebellum, bilateral Rolandic operculum, left cerebellum crus 1, right supramarginal, and right postcentral. The specific-related network was also found in several brain areas like the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R.), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), right cerebellum 8 (cerebellum 8R), and left cerebellum crus 2 (cerebellum crus 2L) (  and  ). \n  \nPain network and non-pain network at ST36. \n  \n\n### Functional characteristics \n  \nFunctional characterization showed that acupuncture at ST36 was mainly associated with motor, cognition, learning and memory, self-awareness, and other aspects ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we systematically reviewed task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. First, we obtained the results of the brain regions activated by acupuncture at ST36 and then distinguished between pain-overlapping activation areas and non-pain activation areas based on the brain areas activated by acupuncture at ST36, where the pain-overlapping brain regions are also the pain sensations produced by the acupuncture itself, and the non-pain activation brain regions are also the specific function of acupuncture at ST36. \n\n### Activation patterns and functional characteristics \n  \nIn this study, we found that bilateral cerebellum, hemispheric lobule VIII, SMG.R, bilateral Rolandic operculum (ROL), and right anterior thalamic projections were activated by acupuncture at ST36. However, this is inconsistent with a previous meta-analysis of ST36 ( ). The reasons for this could be explained by the following two points: first, the previous review investigated the effect of deqi when acupuncture at ST36 was applied on brain function; second, different statistical methods and thresholds may be available, this study is more rigorous in this regard. \n\nEvidence suggests that the primary characteristic roles of the cerebellum not only include motor control function but also its non-motor function in cognitive control and learning processing ( ;  ;  ). Although the cerebellum has often been shown to respond to painful stimuli, the current findings show that the cerebellum is more concerned with visceral than somatic pain ( ), which is consistent with the fact that ST36 is often used clinically to treat visceral pain ( ). In addition, recent studies have also shown that electroacupuncture at ST36 can modulate cerebellar lobule VIII to treat comorbid brain regions of depression and pain ( ), further confirming ST36\u2019s important role in the treatment of these conditions. \n\nStudies also demonstrate that the right SMG.R has implications for cognitive functions such as temporal perception and attention, pitch memory performance ( ), emotion recognition ( ), visual word recognition ( ), and episodic memory encoding ( ). \n\nThe Rolandic operculum processes integrated exteroceptive-interoceptive signals that are necessary for interoceptive awareness and bodily self-consciousness ( ). Several studies have reported that the Rolandic operculum not only plays a role in emotion processing but also in the sensory system for gustatory and visceral sensations together with the cingulate-operculum network ( ;  ). The gastrointestinal tract has been reported to be sensitive to emotion (depression, anxiety, and stress); the connection between the brain and gastrointestinal organs is explained by the theory of a gut-brain axis (top-down and bottom-up) ( ). \n\nTherefore, based on the functional characteristics of acupuncture at ST36, we found that this may be effective in the treatment of motor, cognition, learning and memory, self-awareness, and other aspects. Importantly, in clinical studies, ST36 is also often used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and to improve constipation ( ;  ), pain ( ;  ), cognition ( ;  ), and other related diseases. \n\n\n### Pain-specific overlapping activation patterns \n  \nAcupuncture needles are applied to the body, which not only produces the sensation of pain but also has therapeutic effects. However, it is not clear whether this effect overlaps with the areas of the brain where the pain is generated or whether acupuncture is specific. \n\nIn this study, we found that the cerebellum, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and postcentral regions of the brain were implicated in the pain network, which is consistent with previous research by   showing that acupuncture stimulation is associated with multidimensional pain. \n\nIn addition, many previous fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ) have described the activation of these sensorimotor brain areas as a common feature of acupunctural stimulation. Thus, activation in sensorimotor brain areas such as the insula, thalamus, SI, and SII presumably reflects the involvement of the sensory pain-associated components of acupunctural needle stimulation. One previous meta-analysis suggested that brain response of acupuncture needle stimulation involved in sensory, cognitive, and affective dimensions of pain ( ). Another study also demonstrated that regardless of the type of harmful stimulus, some brain regions such as the thalamus, insula, and ACC have a significant potential for activation, suggesting that acupuncture, as an external stimulation, could activate some important brain regions ( ). \n\nImportantly, we found that a specific-related network of acupuncture on ST36 was found in several brain areas, including IFG.R, STG.L, cerebellum 8R, and cerebellum crus 2L, which is consistent with a recent systematic review similar to this one that showed the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions were positively activated following ST36 acupuncture ( ). \n\nThe IFG.R has a role in modulating cognitive control in several domains, such as inhibitory control and the process of allocating attention ( ). It also plays a causal role in the control of interference in memory retrieval ( ). STG.L plays an important role in auditory processing and social cognition ( ). The cerebellum is crucially involved in a wide spectrum of cognitive and affective functions ( ), in addition to its well-established role in balance control and motor function ( ). According to the above information, we could conclude that cognitive function is a common characteristic of specific activation patterns of ST36, which is consistent with previous research findings ( ;  ). We speculate that acupuncture at ST36 could not only improve cognitive function but also regulate movement, auditory processing, and so on. \n\nAlthough we found some interesting results from the current data, the interpretation of the results is complex because the central stimulation is not just a linear association. Therefore, it is difficult for us to determine the diseases that could be treated by acupuncture at ST36 through the activated brain region of acupuncture at ST36, so it needs to be combined with clinical practice to finally determine the brain map of acupuncture at ST36. Nonetheless, it still offers us some clinical guidance. In addition, although ST36 acupuncture produces pain-related brain regions linked to the physical stimulation of acupuncture, these cannot be ruled out as part of the treatment. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. First, the studies included in our meta-analysis differ with respect to experimental design, analytical methods, and software, which may lead to some heterogeneity. However, we did not find any heterogeneity in this study. Second, a previous study ( ) found that the disease state is an important factor in the cerebral response to acupuncture stimulation. In this review, we only paid attention to healthy subjects, due to the small number of studies and sample size of acupuncture for patients. Third, the lack of control over the design of sham acupuncture reduces the reliability of the conclusions. Finally, due to the small number of included studies, the results need to be interpreted with caution. \n\n\n### Suggestions for future studies \n  \nFuture studies should increase the sample size because a sufficient one is necessary to ensure sample power and obtain stable and reliable results. \n\nIn terms of brain response, the difference between verum acupoints and sham acupoints should be investigated in more studies to confirm the specificity of acupoints. In addition, the detailed acupoint operation of ST36 should be clearly described, and future acupuncture clinical trials should follow the STRICTA standards ( ). \n\nIn terms of fMRI, there is some room for improvement, such as higher resolution and strict statistical analysis to obtain reliable results. Specifically, an appropriate experimental design for investigating acupuncture effects, such as a block- and event-related design, is crucial. Recently, a data-driven approach was considered suitable for describing response characteristics. Perhaps the most suitable method is to define the ROI to explore the efficacy of acupuncture based on the abnormal brain area of the corresponding disease. Finally, a strict threshold is also one of the important conditions to obtain reliable results. Furthermore, a checklist for the fMRI study should be followed in order to provide some reference for further research ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, fMRI is a useful visualization tool for investigating the central mechanisms of acupoints. This study found that acupuncture at ST36 activated the bilateral cerebellum, hemispheric lobule VIII, bilateral Rolandic operculum, and right supramarginal gyrus, suggesting that acupuncture at ST36 could be used to treat motor, cognitive, learning and memory, and emotion-related disorders. This study provides new insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of acupuncture. In the future, it will be possible to map the brain altas of each acupoint, allowing it to achieve precise treatment of diseases. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nHY, JX, and QH designed the whole study.

{"text":"Sugranyes, Gisela and Kyriakopoulos, Marinos and Corrigall, Richard and Taylor, Eric and Frangou, Sophia\nPLoS One, 2011\n\n# Title\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia: Meta-Analysis of the Neural Correlates of Social Cognition\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Context \n  \nImpaired social cognition is a cardinal feature of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Schizophrenia (SZ). However, the functional neuroanatomy of social cognition in either disorder remains unclear due to variability in primary literature. Additionally, it is not known whether deficits in ASD and SZ arise from similar or disease-specific disruption of the social cognition network. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nTo identify regions most robustly implicated in social cognition processing in SZ and ASD. \n\n\n## Data Sources \n  \nSystematic review of English language articles using MEDLINE (1995\u20132010) and reference lists. \n\n\n## Study Selection \n  \nStudies were required to use fMRI to compare ASD or SZ subjects to a matched healthy control group, provide coordinates in standard stereotactic space, and employ standardized facial emotion recognition (FER) or theory of mind (TOM) paradigms. \n\n\n## Data Extraction \n  \nActivation foci from studies meeting inclusion criteria (n\u200a=\u200a33) were subjected to a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation, and encompassed 146 subjects with ASD, 336 SZ patients and 492 healthy controls. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nBoth SZ and ASD showed medial prefrontal hypoactivation, which was more pronounced in ASD, while ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction was associated mostly with SZ. Amygdala hypoactivation was observed in SZ patients during FER and in ASD during more complex ToM tasks. Both disorders were associated with hypoactivation within the Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) during ToM tasks, but activation in these regions was increased in ASD during affect processing. Disease-specific differences were noted in somatosensory engagement, which was increased in SZ and decreased in ASD. Reduced thalamic activation was uniquely seen in SZ. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nReduced frontolimbic and STS engagement emerged as a shared feature of social cognition deficits in SZ and ASD. However, there were disease- and stimulus-specific differences. These findings may aid future studies on SZ and ASD and facilitate the formulation of new hypotheses regarding their pathophysiology. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism and psychotic disorders have historically been considered as related diagnostic entities. One of the innovations of the DSM-III in the late 1970s was to separate autism spectrum disorders (ASD) from schizophrenia (SZ) into different diagnostic categories. Although this distinction has many practical advantages, it is currently being reconsidered in view of emerging evidence about common neurobiological processes in both disorders  \u2013 . \n\nImpairment in social cognition is a cardinal feature of the clinical presentation of both ASD and SZ  \u2013 . The term social cognition refers to a complex set of processes subserving adaptive social interaction which depend on \u201ctheory of mind\u201d, or in other words, the ability to make correct attributions of the mental states of others  \u2013 . Theory of mind (ToM) broadly refers to three types of attributions: attribution of epistemic mental states (e.g. beliefs), attribution of intentions or motivations and attribution of affective states. A range of tasks have been developed to map on these core mentalising domains. Facial emotion recognition (FER) relates to the ability to infer the emotional state of others, and although it measures a core dimension of ToM, it is usually mentioned separately. We will follow this convention here for ease of reference to the existing literature. Similarly, we will use the term ToM to collectively refer to tasks of epistemic (e.g. false beliefs) or intention attribution and tasks that involve more than one ToM domain (e.g. the attribution of mental states and intentions to animated geometric figures). \n\nNeurobiological models of social cognition implicate an extended neural network in processing social stimuli  \u2013 . Regions most consistently involved are the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral temporal regions around the superior temporal sulcus (STS), occipitotemporal regions (particularly within the fusiform gyrus), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and limbic structures, especially the amygdala. These regions are interconnected and have additional connectivity with somatosensory cortices and subcortical structures such as the thalamus. There is emerging consensus for relative regional specialization within this extended network. Involvement of the medial PFC in social cognition is elicited by multiple tasks that require conscious attribution or judgment of mental states, dispositional traits or intentions of one's self or of others  . Engagement of the ventrolateral PFC relates primarily to the contextual or social appropriateness of responses to social cues  \u2013 . Regions surrounding the TPJ have systematically been associated with social cognition tasks requiring participants to \u201cthink about other people's thoughts\u201d or in other words, to take a third person perspective about others' affective or cognitive states  ,  . Activation in regions around the STS has been reliably associated with salient biological movement, including changeable characteristics of human facial features, which can be used to infer affective or intentional states  ,  . Similarly, somatosensory cortices are thought to contribute to social cognition by invoking or \u201cmirroring\u201d internal representations of affective states  . The amygdala is thought to contribute to social cognition by mediating arousal   or biological salience   associated with stimuli. \n\nCurrent reviews of the neural basis of social cognition deficits in SZ  ,   and ASD   have implicated most, if not all the regions within this network. However, the current literature has two significant limitations. Firstly, existing reviews, which are mostly narrative, highlight the variability in the findings from individual studies, but do not provide an integrated model of the functional neuroanatomy of social cognition in either SZ or ASD. Secondly, there are no neuroimaging studies to date directly comparing patients with ASD or SZ, with the single exception of Pinkham et al  . The authors compared SZ and ASD patients while performing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task requiring participants to judge the trustworthiness of human faces; both patient groups showed reduced activation in the amygdala and ventrolateral PFC. \n\nThe aims of this study were to synthesize existing fMRI data using a meta-analytic approach in order to (a) identify regions most robustly implicated in social cognition processing in SZ and ASD and (b) to draw inferences about differences and similarities in the neural correlates of social cognition between the two disorders. Our key predictions were that during tasks of social cognition both disorders would be associated with reduced engagement within PFC regions associated with mentalising, and that similar functional disruption would also be observed in limbic regions, particularly the amygdala. We also hypothesized that in SZ, PFC dysfunction would be associated with reduced down-regulation of more posterior brain regions involved in the attribution of salience to biological social cues (e.g. facial affect). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Data sources and inclusion criteria \n  \nThe study design and report adhered to the PRISMA Statement guidelines (supporting information   and  ). The search method and inclusion criteria were specified in advance, informed by existing meta-analyses  ,  ,  . All identified articles were reviewed for eligibility by at least two authors, and decisions for inclusion were made by consensus. Data was extracted independently from each study by the first author, and was subsequently reviewed by a second author. \n\nStudies investigating FER or ToM in subjects with ASD (including autism, Asperger's Syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) or SZ were identified through a computerized literature search using Medline. We reviewed all papers in English language published up to 2010. The following search keywords were employed: \u201cautism\u201d, \u201cschizophrenia\u201d, \u201casperger\u201d, and \u201cfacial emotion\u201d, \u201cemotional processing\u201d, \u201csocial cognition\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind\u201d, \u201cmentalization\u201d, \u201cirony\u201d, \u201cempathy\u201d, \u201cfMRI\u201d and their combinations and differing terminations, as well as terms specifying individual facial affect (fear, happiness, sadness, anger and disgust). The reference lists of these papers were searched for additional articles. \n\nIn order to meet inclusion criteria, studies were required to (a) report comparisons between ASD or SZ patients and matched healthy controls, (b) employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (c) use image subtraction methodology to identify foci of task-related neural changes contrasting an active and control condition, and (d) report their results in standard stereotactic coordinates (either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute space). Studies not fulfilling these requirements were excluded. No age, gender or treatment restrictions were applied. \n\nAdditionally, facial affect processing studies were included if they used human facial identities as stimuli in both active and control condition (as opposed to geometric shapes) and were excluded if they used facial stimuli to investigate processes not directly involved in emotional processing, such as working memory or attention. As the majority of FER studies used negatively valence facial expressions (anger, fear, sadness) we focused exclusively on these to minimize heterogeneity due to valence  . \n\nInformation extracted from each included: a) foci of task-related neural changes contrasting an active and control condition between either patient group (ASD or SZ) and healthy controls b) a description of each task and the selected contrast c) clinical Information concerning age, gender, diagnosis, symptom scales, illness duration and treatment, and matching of the healthy control group. \n\n\n### Quantitative meta-analytical voxel-based procedure \n  \nWe used one contrast from each study as shown in   and  , and we accepted results as significant based on the threshold employed in the original studies. \n   Details of studies included in the meta-analysis for facial emotion recognition tasks.         Clinical description of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders included in facial emotion recognition studies.        \n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation procedure \n  \nCoordinates from FER and ToM studies were analysed separately following the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) technique implemented in GingerALE 2.0.4 ( ). This version uses a random effect model and weighting for sample size of the original studies  . Coordinates of the foci of activation reported in the original studies were transformed into Talairach space using the Lancaster transform (icbm2tal tool) in GingerALE. For each study, peaks were modelled as the centre of a 3D Gaussian distribution and a modelled activation (MA) map was then computed. ALE scores from the convergent MA maps were then calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis to test for convergent (random-effects) rather than study specific foci (fixed-effects). All ALE data processing was performed using the BrainMap Search and View software ( ). The threshold of statistical significance was set at p<0.05, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons and a minimum cluster size of 80 mm . Each ALE map was imported into Mango ( ) and overlaid on an anatomical Template ( ) for representation purposes. Significant clusters were manually localized and Brodmann areas (BA) were identified using the standard Talairach and Tournoux   stereotactic anatomic brain atlas. Finally, in order to compare diagnostic groups, the ALE Maps for SZ and ASD for each experimental design (e.g. ALE map for ASD FER vs ALE map for SZ FER) were directly contrasted using subtraction meta-analysis procedure implemented in GingerALE version 1.1  . Regions in which the two diagnostic groups differed were defined at p<0.05 with FDR correction and a minimum cluster size of 200 mm . \n\n\n### Demographic data analysis \n  \nStudent   t   tests (two-tailed) or chi-square tests were used to compare the distribution of continuous and categorical demographic variables between the two groups. Only variables which displayed group differences were subjected to voxel-wise meta-regression analyses in order to examine their effect on the ALE results. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe initial search returned 415 citations. Of these, 337 studies were discarded after reviewing the abstracts while the full text of the remaining 76 citations was examined in more detail. Thirty three studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.

The total analysis encompassed 91 ASD and 133 SZ patients, and 239 HC subjects. Demographic details for all participants and clinical information corresponding to ASD and SZ patients are shown in   and  . ASD subjects were significantly younger than SZ (ASD: mean\u200a=\u200a18.55, SD\u200a=\u200a7.03; SZ: mean\u200a=\u200a31.36, SD\u200a=\u200a4.08; t\u200a=\u200a4.1, df\u200a=\u200a13, p\u200a=\u200a.001), and included a higher percentage of males (ASD: mean\u200a=\u200a95.2%,; SZ: mean\u200a=\u200a63.0%, chi-quare\u200a=\u200a47.01, df\u200a=\u200a1, p<0.001). \n   Details of studies included in the meta-analysis for theory of mind tasks.

In the inverse contrast, SZ was associated with greater likelihood of engagement in regions within the medial PFC and somatosensory areas in the paracentral gyrus, and in the posterior cingulate cortex ( ;  ). The effect size of signal differences in the medial PFC region was positively correlated with age (peak coordinates\u200a=\u200a\u221226, 50, 2; r \u200a=\u200a0.28; p\u200a=\u200a0.001; voxels\u200a=\u200a59). \n   Activation likelihood estimation results for theory of mind tasks comparison of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.        \n\n\n### Examination of confounding factors \n  \n#### Age \n  \nThe effect size of signal differences in the medial PFC region was positively correlated with age (peak coordinates\u200a=\u200a\u221226, 50, 2; r \u200a=\u200a0.28; p\u200a=\u200a0.001; voxels\u200a=\u200a59). This would suggest that some of the differences observed between ASD and SZ in this area may be also modulated by age. \n\n\n#### Antipsychotic medication \n  \nDetails of pharmacological treatments are displayed in   and  . The mean dose of antipsychotic drugs was converted into chlorpromazine equivalent doses. Studies providing information on the mean daily chlorpromazine equivalent dose of antipsychotics for their sample were included in voxel-wise meta-regressions exploring the relationship between dose and magnitude of ALE scores. Antipsychotic medications were found to have a normalizing effect on amygdala involvement during FER. The effect size of signal differences in the amygdala was negatively correlated with dose of antipsychotics (peak coordinates: [30, \u22122, \u221218]; r \u200a=\u200a0.48; p\u200a=\u200a0.001; number of voxels\u200a=\u200a45), and therefore it is unlikely that the differences observed between ASD and SZ are due to the effects of antipsychotic medication. With regards to ToM, we also found an ameliorative effect of medication on the activation in the superior temporal gyrus (peak voxels: [46, 10, \u221224]; r \u200a=\u200a0.48; p\u200a=\u200a0.001; number of voxels\u200a=\u200a237; and [44, 16, 12]; r \u200a=\u200a0.27; p\u200a=\u200a0.001; number of voxels\u200a=\u200a171), which we also interpret as unlikely to be the source of the group differences. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe used quantitative analysis to explore the neural correlates of social cognition during facial emotion recognition (FER) and theory of mind (ToM) tasks in ASD and SZ. Differential effects of task and diagnosis were noted in the distribution and direction of the findings. Our key findings can be summarised as follows: (a) Both SZ and ASD patients showed reduced engagement in medial PFC regions, with the extent and degree of deficit being greater in ASD; conversely, ventrolateral PFC disruption was associated mostly with SZ, (b) SZ was associated with hyperactivation in somatosensory cortices, while ASD subjects showed reduced activity in these regions, (c) amygdala hypoactivation was observed in SZ patients during facial emotion processing and in ASD during more complex ToM tasks, (d) both SZ and ASD were associated with decreased engagement of regions around the STS during ToM tasks, but when processing facial affect, overactivation in these regions was noted in ASD, (e) reduced thalamic engagement was uniquely associated with SZ. \n\n### Prefrontal and midline cortical involvement \n  \nWe found both similarities and differences in prefrontal engagement in ASD and SZ. During FER tasks, SZ patients were significantly more likely than ASD to engage the ventrolateral PFC, but the degree of activation was less than in controls. Both SZ and ASD were associated with hypoactivation in medial PFC regions during ToM tasks, although the deficits were quantitatively greater in ASD and extended more posteriorly into the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. \n\nThe role of the ventrolateral PFC in social cognition has begun to be more fully appreciated as it is involved in multiple tasks of social cognition  . This region is thought to modulate the influence of emotional stimuli on cognition with respect to contextually (or socially) appropriate behaviour  ,  ,  ,  . Our findings of hypoactivation in SZ patients in this region reinforce the results of Leitman and colleagues   who demonstrated reduced contextual modulation of the ventrolateral PFC in SZ in connection to impaired affective appraisal. In contrast, activation in the medial prefrontal cortex is thought to underlie emotion generation, particularly when assessing self-relevant attributes or emotional awareness  \u2013 . Therefore our results imply that reduced PFC engagement in connection to the social appropriateness of behaviour may be more relevant to SZ, while in both SZ and ASD, reduced medial PFC engagement may contribute to abnormalities in conscious awareness of the emotional states of others. \n\n\n### Somato-sensory cortices \n  \nActivation in primary and secondary somato-sensory cortices was reduced in ASD, in comparison to controls and SZ patients, during both FER and ToM tasks. Engagement of somato-sensory cortices is thought to invoke (\u201cmirror\u201d) bodily states associated with pertinent emotions or other internal states, thus facilitating their recognition in oneself or others  ,  ,  . Our findings in ASD are consistent with reports of abnormal cortical thickness and grey matter volume patterns in the corresponding anatomical regions  ,   and lend further support to the notion that ASD is associated with dysfunction in invoking \u201cmirroring\u201d mechanisms when processing social stimuli  . Our evidence of increased involvement of somato-sensory regions during social cognitive tasks in SZ adds to similar findings  ,  , and may contribute to the over-attribution of agency and \u201chypermentalization\u201d described in schizophrenia  ,  . \n\n\n### Amygdala \n  \nDecreased engagement of the amygdala was observed in SZ patients during FER tasks, which confirms findings from earlier meta-analytic studies  ,  . However, Anticevic et al   have reported that in SZ there is increased amygdala activation to neutral stimuli, which may have reduced the contrast between emotional and neutral conditions employed here. In ASD subjects, amygdala hypoactivation was observed during ToM tasks, in line with previous reports of significant amygdala pathology in autism  \u2013 . Our results suggest that both SZ and ASD show deficits in engaging the amygdala when processing social stimuli, but this observation may depend on stimulus type. In SZ, reduced amygdala activation was associated with tasks of attribution of affective states, while in ASD it was mostly seen during tasks of epistemic and intentional attributions. We can only speculate as to the underlying mechanisms of this stimulus-specific dissociation of amygdala engagement in SZ and ASD. \n\nThe amygdala is not a homogeneous structure but is comprised of 13 nuclei. The functional specificity of the amygdala nuclei remains unclear, since selective lesions in humans have not been reported. Despite evidence that damage to basal and lateral nuclei may be more directly linked to recognition of facial expressions  ,   it is not known whether there is regional specialisation within the amygdala for processing other social stimuli. However, our data suggest that the possibility of disease specific regional pathology in SZ and ASD may be worth pursuing in future studies. \n\n\n### Lateral and ventral temporal regions \n  \nBoth SZ and ASD were associated with similar hypoactivation in temporal regions around the STS during ToM tasks; however ASD patients showed increased engagement in this region compared to controls and to SZ patients during FER. \n\nTemporal lobe regions near the STS are thought to be involved in the representation of biologically salient cues relating to goal-directed movement   including the configural and changeable properties of human faces  . Processing of this information in regions around the STS is thought to assist in formulating attributions about the intentional states of others  ,  . \n\nOur results suggest that processing information relating to ToM tasks was associated with similar reduction in engagement within these regions both in SZ and ASD. However, we also found evidence that STS engagement may differ between disorders based on stimulus type, as ASD patients showed overactivation in these regions during FER. Reduced activation in regions around the STS (extending to the fusiform gyrus) has been noted in ASD patients during person identification tasks (i.e. memorising and recalling information about the identity of a face); however person identification is not required in facial emotion recognition paradigms which rely on decoding the \u201csocial\u201d (i.e. emotional) cues conveyed by facial expression. Our results resonate with previous reports that patients with ASD rely excessively on facial feature extraction during facial processing   and suggest that they probably use a \u201clogical\u201d rather than a \u201csocial\u201d approach to dealing with human facial expressions. Our findings reinforce the dependence of functional changes in ASD on the type of stimulus and also the specific task requirements which would be useful in informing and refining future study designs. \n\n\n### Thalamus \n  \nDecreased engagement of the thalamus during social cognition was found mostly in connection to SZ, implicating the dorsomedial and pulvinar nuclei. The thalamus provides a nodal link for multiple functional circuits coordinating the flow of information in a range of higher cognitive and sensory processes. The pulvinar is is considered a \u201chigher order\u201d nucleus because of its widespread bidirectional cortical connections; it is directly involved in visual perception, particularly in directing and maintaining attention towards salient stimuli. The involvement of the dorsomedial thalamus in social cognition is mostly considered within the context of its general contribution to executive functions through its connections with the prefrontal cortex. Extensive thalamic pathology both in terms of microstructure, gross anatomy and functional engagement have been consistently reported in SZ  . Our findings extend this literature to include thalamic dysfunction to social cognition tasks. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nAlthough Activation Likelihood Estimation represents a powerful approach for the meta-analytic treatment of neuroimaging data, a number of factors should be considered in the interpretation of the current set of findings. First, comparison of neuroimaging studies between SZ and ASD is complicated by the variability of the activation paradigms used. We attempted to minimise this by grouping together paradigms that map on to different domains of social cognition and then examining them separately. This was possible for studies investigating attribution of affective states using facial expressions. However, given the variability of the ToM paradigms we followed the approach of other meta-analytic studies, which have also pooled several related domains of cognition together  ,  . Second, we accepted the results of individual original studies as reported, since ALE analyses do not allow for weighting based on the threshold of significance employed in each original study. Some studies have reported coordinates extracted from pre-specified regions of interest; this may have inflated the weight assigned to the findings regarding the amygdala and fusiform gyrus (FER studies), and medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate and STS (ToM studies). Third, ASD and SZ patients differ in their symptom profiles, with psychotic symptoms being predominantly associated with the diagnosis of SZ. Previous studies have suggested that the presence or absence of positive symptoms may contribute to the distribution and degree of functional disruption in SZ during social cognition  . The contribution of psychotic symptoms to the present findings is unclear. Nevertheless, the majority of SZ studies included patients that would be generally regarded as being in remission. Fourth, we have documented effects of antipsychotic medication on signal differences in several brain regions; however, these effects are predominantly ameliorative (i.e. reduced the effect size of group differences), and are thus unlikely to account for the differences observed between groups. Fifth, although gender differences have been found during social cognition tasks   it was not possible to examine this directly because the predominance of male participants in ASD studies did not allow gender-specific analysis of the available data. Fifth, age differences between the diagnostic groups may have influenced our findings, particularly in ToM tasks, where ASD patients were significantly younger than SZ patients. Indeed, an effect of age was observed in prefrontal regions, favouring SZ. Sixth, the average sample size per study was generally small. This suggests that individual studies may be prone to Type II errors, but also that our results represent the most robustly replicated group differences. Finally, our meta-analysis provides an estimate of how consistently clusters of differential activation occur in particular brain regions when comparing groups of individuals (e.g. SZ vs. controls), and not the mean activation difference in these regions. Therefore traditional measures of heterogeneity and publication bias that are based on the effect size of group differences are not applicable. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nIn sum, the present results shed light on the neural correlates of social cognition in SZ and ASD and identify differences and similarities between the disorders. In the context of the current debate with regard to diagnostic boundaries, we hope that these findings will facilitate the formulation of new pathophysiological hypotheses and aid the design of future studies. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3187762,"text_md5":"05541df52d9a9b07f0eaed37bbc5f813","field_positions":{"authors":[0,104],"journal":[105,113],"publication_year":[115,119],"title":[130,233],"keywords":[247,247],"abstract":[260,2414],"body":[2423,32356]},"batch":1,"pmid":21998649,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0025322","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3187762","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3187762"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3187762\">3187762<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3187762  Autism Spectrum Disorders and Schizophrenia: Meta-Analysis of the Neural Correlates of Social Cognition"}

Recent studies have focused on how the dorsal striatum participates in a single cognitive function, whereas the specific roles of the caudate and putamen in performing multiple cognitive functions remain unclear. In this paper we conducted a meta-analysis of the relevant neuroimaging literature to understand the roles of subregions of the dorsal striatum in performing different functions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nPubMed, Web of Science, and BrainMap Functional Database were searched to find original functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies conducted on healthy adults under reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making tasks, and relevant screening criteria were formulated. Single task activation, contrast activation, and conjunction activation analyses were performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method for the coordinate-based meta-analysis to evaluate the differences and linkages. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn all, 112 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Analysis revealed that, of the 4 single activation tasks, reward, memory, and emotion tasks all activated the putamen more, whereas decision-making tasks activated the caudate body. Contrast analysis showed that the caudate body played an important role in the 2 cooperative activation tasks, but conjunction activation results found that more peaks appeared in the caudate head. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDifferent subregions of the caudate and putamen assume different roles in processing complex cognitive behaviors. Functional division of the dorsal striatum identified specific roles of 15 different subregions, reflecting differences and connections between the different subregions in performing different cognitive behaviors. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDuring the brain\u2019s processing of reward information and negative emotions, dopamine release increases in the dorsal and ventral striatum ( , ). The hippocampus in the brain is the key hub of episodic memory, but the insula and dorsal striatum are also related to other forms of memory ( ). Similarly, a growing amount of evidence from neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies shows that there are direct and indirect ways to control decision-making behavior in the striatum, and the brain\u2019s choices based on current expected return or actions related to decision making are closely related to the dorsal striatum ( - ). At first, these functions seem unrelated, but the commonality among them all is the dorsal striatum. The striatum is a nucleus in the basal ganglia, and the dorsal striatum, consisting of the caudate and putamen, is the gateway to the basal ganglia. The dorsal striatum receives convergent excitatory afferents from the cortex and thalamus and forms the origins of the direct and indirect pathways that are important in the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical circuit ( ). The dopaminergic neurons in this circuit are distributed throughout the striatum, which is of great significance to neurological diseases involving abnormal basal ganglia and dopaminergic function, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia ( , ). From this viewpoint, it is particularly important to functionally localize the caudate and putamen in the dorsal striatum and explore their differences and connections. \n\nThere has been a considerable increase in the number of meta-analyses in neuroimaging field in recent years ( ), but studies integrating multiple different activation tasks in the same region to show their coherence remain rare. To better understand the roles of subregions of the dorsal striatum in performing different functions, this study aimed to explore functional partitioning in the caudate and putamen using a meta-analysis of the existing literature. Recent meta-analyses on brain studies have produced substantial findings. For example, using a coordinate-based meta-analysis, Arioli   et al.   found that the lateral temporal areas and the amygdala are involved in processing social and emotional concepts ( ). In 2021, Mas-Herrero   et al.   used a meta-analysis to integrate brain involvement in music and food responses to identify reward circuits involved in the brain response ( ). In the same year, Sorella   et al.   used a meta-analysis to investigate whether or not anger perception and anger experience rely on similar or different neural mechanisms in the human brain ( ). Inspired by these studies, the present study used the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method to determine commonly activated brain regions by collecting data from multiple studies and used spatial coordinates under reward, emotion, memory, and decision-making tasks ( , ) to discern the functional division of the dorsal striatum. \n\nThe idea behind the ALE method is that coordinates reported in the included studies are considered likelihood distributions, which are modeled by a 3-dimensional Gaussian function ( ) and from which an ALE value can be calculated for each voxel to estimate the activation probability of each voxel for the task identified throughout the study. Finally, in order to distinguish the real convergence of focus from random clustering, an ALE null-distribution is formed by thousands of iterations of whole-brain coordinates ( ). Coordinate-based meta-analyses are not limited by experimental design, task, the number of subjects, or methods of data analysis, and they can maximize the consistency of location information between studies and minimize the subjectivity of analytical methods ( ). \n\nIn recent years, many researchers have used different methods to map the relationship between the structure and function of the human brain (i.e., a brain atlas) ( ). Inspired by the creation of the brain atlas, we used the ALE algorithm to integrate different studies on the striatum in the human brain to create a functional division in this region, with each subregion created by this division being involved in different activation tasks ( ). This study had two main aims: (I) to identify the subregions in the striatum of healthy adults involved in processing reward, emotion, memory, and decision-making tasks; and (II) to analyze similarities and differences in the subregions that assume different functions in response to the 4 activation tasks. These activation tasks were chosen because these cognitive functions are widely used by humans and are the most studied in the neuroimaging literature, ensuring there are sufficient activation foci for the meta-analysis. We present the following article in accordance with the PRISMA reporting checklist (available at  ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn this study, the functional division of the dorsal striatum was achieved through a literature search, retrieval, screening, and data extraction; ALE analysis of single activation tasks; and ALE conjunction and contrast analyses of multiple activation tasks. Cumulatively, this approach was able to show that different regions assume different functional roles (see  ). \n  \nMethodological flowchart for this study.

The BrainMap Functional Database, accessed using Sleuth V3.0.4 ( ), contains data of functional and structural neuroimaging experiments based on Talairach coordinates ( ) or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space ( ), and is widely used for meta-analyses of human brain structure and function research in healthy and diseased individuals. \n\nSpecific keyword searches were performed to retrieve literature relating to the reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making paradigms. For the reward paradigm, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the following keywords: \u201cdorsal striatum\u201d OR \u201cstriatum\u201d AND \u201creward\u201d AND \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\u201d NOT \u201canimal\u201d. This search identified 2,970 nonoverlapping studies. In the BrainMap Functional Database, \u201creward\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d were the 2 keywords used, with the experimental environment set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d; this identified another 12 nonoverlapping studies. \n\nFor the memory paradigm, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords \u201cdorsal striatum\u201d OR \u201cstriatum\u201d AND \u201cmemory\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d NOT \u201canimal\u201d, with 1484 nonoverlapping studies identified. The BrainMap Functional Database was searched using the keywords \u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d, with the experimental environment set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d; this identified another 22 non-overlapping studies. \n\nFor the emotion paradigm, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords \u201cdorsal striatum\u201d OR \u201cstriatum\u201d AND \u201cemotion\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d NOT \u201canimal\u201d, identifying 1,604 nonoverlapping studies. The BrainMap Functional Database was searched using the keywords \u201cemotion\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d, with the experimental environment set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d, identifying another 36 nonoverlapping studies. \n\nFor the decision-making paradigm, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords \u201cdorsal striatum\u201d OR \u201cstriatum\u201d AND (\u201cdecision\u201d OR \u201cdecision-making\u201d) AND \u201cfMRI\u201d NOT \u201canimal\u201d, with 1,681 nonoverlapping studies identified. Using the search terms (\u201cdecision\u201d OR \u201cdecision-making\u201d) and \u201cfMRI\u201d in the BrainMap Functional Database, with the experimental environment set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d, another 3 nonoverlapping studies were identified. \n\nThus, a total of 7,812 nonoverlapping studies were identified in this study. \n\n\n#### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nBefore selecting articles for inclusion in a meta-analysis, comprehensive inclusion criteria must be determined and rigorously applied to minimize bias. In the present study, all studies included were magnetic resonance imaging studies performed in healthy adults aged 14\u201379 years. The titles, abstracts, and full text of all articles were screened for eligibility ( ). Case reports, pharmacological trials, trials involving clinical populations, neuroimaging studies on children or on patients with certain neurological diseases, and review articles were excluded. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they met the following criteria: published after 2000; activation reported in standardized 3-dimensional space (Talairach or MNI), with the activation area being the dorsal striatum (caudate, putamen); use of fMRI; the activation task resulting in instantaneous activation; and the activation type reported by the researchers being \u201creward\u201d, \u201cmemory\u201d, \u201cemotion\u201d, and \u201cdecision making\u201d. The application of these criteria yielded 29 reward studies (548 subjects, 74 trials), 26 memory studies (463 subjects, 50 trials), 31 emotion studies (658 subjects, 52 trials), and 26 decision-making studies (518 subjects, 50 trials), for a total of 112 studies ( ) that were used in the meta-analysis. \n  \nFlowchart showing study inclusion in the meta-analysis. fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  \n\n#### Data extraction \n  \nData were independently extracted from all included studies by Ba and Wang and included basic information (e.g., article title, author\/s, and publication date), participant information (e.g., number of participants, age\/mean age, and male:female ratio), experimental materials (e.g., scanned fMRI data) and stimulation methods (e.g., objects, pictures, videos, language, music), study methods (e.g., whether the data coordinates reported are in MNI or Talairach space), and the results (e.g., literature research activation paradigm, as well as activation area). \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### ALE analysis for single activation tasks \n  \nThe specific process of ALE analysis for single activation tasks using GingerALE V3.0.2 ( ) software was as follows: \n  \nData organization: the coordinates in all studies included in this analysis were exported to plain text (.txt) files using Sleuth software. \n  \nTransformation: all coordinates were transformed into coordinates in common MNI space. \n  \nParameter setting: uncorrected P value thresholds were used to yield reasonable results, with a threshold of P<0.01 and the minimum cluster size set to a volume of 600 mm . \n  \nMask processing: the object of this study is the dorsal striatum, so the masks of the caudate and the putamen generated by the anatomical automatic labeling (AAL) atlas ( ) were used for processing. \n\nViewing results: Mango ( ) software was used to view the results of the meta-analysis, and the Colin atlas ( ) was used with consideration to the statistical coordinate data in MNI space. \n\n\n#### ALE analysis of conjunction and contrast for multiple activation tasks \n  \nTo test for significant differences in the results of analyses of the four single activation tasks, GingerALE software also provides conjunction and contrast meta-analyses. ALE analysis results for the four activation tasks were merged into a single data set before the conjunction and contrast meta-analyses, which resulted in six data sets in total. ALE analysis was performed on the merged data set, and then conjunction and contrast analyses were performed using the ALE threshold images of the merged data set. Conjunction analysis includes any two kinds of conjunction results (e.g., A conjunction B), whereas contrast analysis includes any two kinds of mutual comparisons (e.g., A-B and B-A). As in ALE analysis for single activation tasks, the parameters for contrast and conjunction analyses were a threshold of P<0.01, with 5,000 P value permutations, and a minimum cluster size of 600 mm . \n\n\n\n### Functional differentiation of the striatum \n  \nUsing the specified parameters in the ALE analysis, activation results for single tasks in the whole brain were obtained; the striatum mask in the AAL brain template was used to process the ALE results to obtain 4 functional partitions of the striatum for reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making tasks. Activation areas in the mask were labeled as follows: 1 for reward, 2 for memory, 4 for emotion, and 8 for decision making. Areas of coactivation were also labeled: 3 for reward and memory; 5 for reward and emotion; 6 for memory and emotion; 7 for reward, memory, and emotion; 9 for reward and decision making; 10 for memory and decision making; 11 for reward, memory, and decision making; 12 for emotion and decision making; 13 for reward, emotion, and decision making; 14 for memory, emotion, and decision making; and 15 for reward, memory, emotion, and decision making. Thus, 15 different functional zones were marked in the striatum area. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Analysis of single activation tasks \n  \n#### Reward \n  \nWe analyzed activation information in the dorsal striatum under different reward tasks, including 26 monetary rewards, 1 each for food rewards, language and social-type rewards, temperature and taste rewards, and personal preference rewards. The skewed distribution of studies toward monetary reward tasks might have caused inclination in the results. However, these studies showed significant consistency in the caudate and putamen, with a total of 12 clusters activated with the coordinates of the largest cluster located from (\u201336, \u201326, \u201326) to (40, 32, 26) in MNI space and a center coordinate of (2, 7, \u20135) (see  ). The analysis showed significant activation in the caudate on the right side of the brain, whereas activation on the left side was mainly in the caudate body and putamen ( ;  ). \n   Activation results under the reward task    \nMNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALE, activation likelihood estimation. \n    \nThe largest activation cluster for the reward task centered at (2,7,\u20135) in Montreal Neurological Institute space.

The results of the whole-brain analysis showed that the memory task activated 12 clusters ( ). Activation peaks were found in the dorsal striatum in the 2 larger clusters and were more significant on the right side of the brain. The largest cluster center was located at (21,4,\u20134) in MNI space ( ;  ). \n   Activation results under the memory task    \nMNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALE, activation likelihood estimation. \n    \nThe largest activation cluster for the memory task centered at (21,4,\u20134) in Montreal Neurological Institute space.

All selected studies contained emotions such as pleasure, neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, and pain, and the main ways to stimulate these emotions were pictures, movies, music, smells, facial expressions, and vocabulary. ALE analysis indicated that 8 clusters were activated by the emotion tasks ( ). The largest activation cluster was located from (\u201336, \u201334, \u201324) to (36, 32, 22) in MNI space, with the center coordinate at (2, 2, \u20131). There were 22 peaks found in the largest activation clusters, but there was no obvious activation peak in the cluster in the caudate head region ( ;  ). \n   Activation results under the emotion task    \nMNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALE, activation likelihood estimation. \n    \nThe largest activation cluster for the emotion task centered at (2,2,\u20131) in Montreal Neurological Institute space.

The ALE algorithm analyzed 4 intertemporal, 3 rewarding, 7 risky, 9 economic, 1 preference, 2 action, and 1 exploratory decision-making studies, showing that 18 clusters were activated in the brain. The largest activated cluster was located from (\u20132, \u201314, \u201320) to (34, 28, 26) in MNI space with central coordinates of (14, 8, 2) and 7 peaks ( ). The peaks in the largest clusters tended to converge in the right brain rather than in the left brain. Compared with other functions, decision-making tasks activated both sides of the brain more evenly ( ;  ). \n   Activation results under the decision-making task    \nMNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALE, activation likelihood estimation. \n    \nThe largest activation cluster for the decision-making task centered at ( , , ) in Montreal Neurological Institute space.

To understand differences in activation areas between different tasks, contrast analysis of the 4 activation tasks was performed; the results of whole-brain contrast analysis are presented in  . Contrast analysis of any 2 tasks showed that, in the dorsal striatum, the activation peak was greater in the putamen than that in other tasks, with this being mainly apparent from the reward and decision-making tasks. In the contrast analysis of other tasks, no significant difference was found in the dorsal striatum.

Similarly, the 4 functional paradigms coactivated the core regions of the caudate and putamen, as well as the remaining regions, were also coactivated by different tasks, indicating that the caudate and putamen are involved in functional integration between different functional categories. \n   Conjunction analysis of multiple single activation tasks    \nMNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ALE, activation likelihood estimation; conj, conjunction. \n  \nAfter the conjunction of any 3 of the 4 types of activation tasks, the striatum was divided into 15 functional subregions, with each functional subregion responsible for different cognitive control. Among the functional subregions, the region located in MNI space from (\u201310, 10, \u20134) to (15, 10, 2) is jointly activated by reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making functions, with a center coordinate of (\u20131, 14, \u20132); this region is part of the caudate head and caudate body. \n\n shows all the conjunction results from 3 different views (axial, coronal, sagittal), and   shows the 15 different functional subregions that the dorsal striatum was divided into in the coronal plane.

Using a coordinate-based meta-analysis method we could differentiate the dorsal striatum into four functional areas, which are defined by reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making functions. The activation peaks of reward and memory function were mainly distributed in the caudate, whereas the activation peaks of emotion and decision-making tasks were evenly distributed in the caudate and putamen. In addition to this functional differentiation, the functional categories were subjected to contrast and conjunction analyses to explore the differences and connections between different functional categories. From these analyses, there were obvious differences in the putamen region. However, the result of conjunction activation of any two functions was located in the caudate and putamen, with no significant difference. \n\nReward is an important motivator for all species and many external factors, such as contextual environment, cognitive value, and reward conditions, can influence individual responses in the face of reward ( ). Unidirectional connections from the cortex to the matrix of the corpus striatum initiate the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical loop, where the striatum has complementary roles in shaping corticostriatal plasticity to record or anticipate reward ( ). Meanwhile, the striatum, as a receptor for cortical and dopamine projections during reward processing, is located at the center of the functional loop that affects the motor and cognitive aspects of behavior ( , ). One study found that when the human brain is rewarded with money, the activation of the right caudate head decreases with decreasing response ( ). Similarly, other research showed that during the expectation of primary ( ) or secondary rewards ( ), the blood oxygen level\u2013dependent response of the dorsal striatum increases. The present study confirms these results in revealing that the dorsal striatum is involved in reward processing. As shown in a comparative study between healthy people and patients with major depressive disorder, decreased reward activation occurs in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula ( ). \n\nMemory function involves the brain integrating structured information and remembering complex multidimensional information through temporal or spatial associations ( ). Evidence from humans and other animals suggests that there are multiple memory systems defined by different neural substrates and functional needs. The memory systems of the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal striatum have different roles in memory tasks. Of these brain regions, the dorsal striatum is more important in memory tasks that need to strengthen stimulus response correlation ( ). Animal studies have found that the dorsal striatum is important for the gradual, feedback-guided learning that results in habit memory, and an elegant double dissociation was demonstrated in rats after the creation of fornix and caudate lesions in two tasks that appeared to measure declarative memory and habit memory ( ). A similar contrast between declarative memory and habit memory was later demonstrated for amnesic patients and patients with Parkinson\u2019 disease ( , ). Although different memory systems are separated, there is still synergistic activation between them. The putamen is mainly associated with the hippocampus in memory tasks, linking the overall events involved in memory ( ). \n\nEmotions influence attention, decision making, memory, physiological responses, and social interactions, and the ability to successfully regulate emotions is associated with many important psychological, social, and physical health outcomes ( , ). In the process of emotion perception and regulation, the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex play a central role in negative emotions, whereas regions such as the striatum and insula cortex play a certain role in the regulation of other emotions ( ). The results of the present study are consistent with the findings of related studies on the role of dopamine in human processing of negative emotions. Dynamic molecular imaging technology has been used to explore dopamine release in the striatum during emotion processing, especially in the caudate and putamen ( ). However, the present study included not only multiple negative emotion-processing studies, but also studies on positive, neutral, disgust, fear, and other emotions. The results of the present study were not significantly different from those of previous single-imaging studies in the dorsal striatum. Difficulty in emotion regulation is considered to be the core mechanism of mood and anxiety disorders ( ). In patients with depression, increases in depression severity are related to the functional connection between the dorsal caudate and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( ). \n\nDecision making is the ability to make an appropriate choice between different action plans, which requires an ability to combine estimates of causal relationships between actions and their consequences or results with their value or utility. Although there is extensive literature linking cognitive functions specific to the prefrontal cortex ( ), other studies suggest that these functions depend on reward-related circuitry linking prefrontal, premotor, and sensorimotor cortices with the striatum ( - ). Most evidence suggests that direct and indirect striatal pathways control behavior in an opposing manner ( , ). In one study, significant activation was found in the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and cingulate gyrus in tasks involving economic decision making behind responses to monetary rewards ( ). For other types of decision-making processes, such as risk decision making, the putamen, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and lingual gyrus, but not the caudate, are positively correlated with behavioral preference. The relevant decision-making studies included in the present analysis were primarily focused on risk and economic decision making, and the results showed significant activation in the putamen region. \n\nContrast analysis was used to examine the significance of differences in the convergence between any two groups of different foci for the four independent tasks. The results showed differences in the processing of different functional information between the caudate and putamen. For example, measurements of anatomical and functional connections in humans, nonhuman primates, and mice have shown that there is a clear link between the caudate and the frontal lobe region responsible for \u201cexecutive\u201d function ( ). The biggest difference between the caudate and putamen in the performance of cognitive function is that the caudate promotes behavior by stimulating correct action schema and selecting appropriate subgoals based on an evaluation of action outcomes, whereas the cognitive function of the putamen is more limited to stimulus response, habit, or learning. The results showed significant differences in the putamen. Different parts of the striatum receive inputs from different cortical regions and project their outputs to the cortex through the thalamus. Meanwhile, the anterior putamen is connected to related areas in the cortex, and the posterior putamen is connected to the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor areas ( ). The putamen seems to be the area for the coordination and cross-functional integration of independent functional channels, directing a coordinated behavioral display and modification in response to external and internal stimuli ( ). Physiologically, volume changes in the putamen are associated with different neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( , ). \n\nIn the context of the functional differentiation of the striatum described above, achieving functional integration is a more critical issue (i.e., conjunction analysis that shows the similarity of the two data sets). Conjunction analysis revealed the overlap of all categories in the caudate and putamen. This overlap may reflect a shared role in information processing between functional systems. This shared role may reflect the multimodal integration between different task categories: on the one hand, with information being transferred between different functional systems; and on the other, with all task categories sharing a common basic functional role ( ). Analysis of a large number of different functional categories in this study showed that most of the final conjunction results of all functions converge in the caudate head and putamen. From this point of view, the core of the conjunction outcome converges in subregions in the caudate and putamen. Although the present study only focused on the caudate and putamen, it is important to understand the anatomical structure of the frontostriatal circuit and related disease processes. Studies have shown that the human caudate is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, frontal eye fields, cerebellum, and thalamus; the putamen is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, primary motor area, primary somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cerebellum, and thalamus ( ). It can be predicted that the functional partitions into which we have divided the striatum may have important implications for future research on related psychiatric disorders caused by striatal circuit disorders. \n\nAnalysis of the functional loss of patients with striatal abnormalities could be used to indirectly validate our functional differentiation. One study confirmed that depression can be safely and effectively treated through repetitive transcranial stimulation therapy ( ). This method improves the integrity of frontostriatal connections by inducing striatal dopamine release onto the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depressed patients. In another study, transplantation of human embryonic mesencephalic tissue bilaterally into the caudate and putamen led to significant symptomatic relief in patients with Parkinson disease and reduced dependence on levodopa ( ). Computed tomography findings in a patient with segmental axial dystonia revealed 3 small areas of encephalomalacia, 1 involving the head of the caudate. In another report, treatment with trihexyphenidyl resulted in significant improvements in dystonia and scoliosis ( ). Huntington disease (HD) is characterized by striatal atrophy that starts before the onset of motor symptoms, and treatment with laquinimod results in reduced volume loss in the caudate and other brain regions in patients with early HD ( ). \n\nAlthough the present study provides an idea for the division of the dorsal striatum into different functional areas, we acknowledge several limitations that need to be addressed in future studies. First, because the nucleus accumbens cannot be accurately located in the common brain atlas, the role of the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) in the functional paradigms we studied was not considered. Second, like many other neuroimaging meta-analysis algorithms, the coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis provides only a measure of reported peak coordinate convergence and not the magnitude of peak activation effects. The coordinate-based meta-analysis requires that each activation cluster exceed the significance threshold set in each study, and does not weight the activation statistics ( ). Third, there are considerable differences in stimulus methods, experimental methods, and scanning parameters among neuroimaging studies included in meta-analyses. Although the possible effects of these factors was minimized in the present study during the literature screening process, it is possible that these systematic differences could have led to some discrepancies. Fourth, the striatum is not only involved in reward, memory, emotion, and decision-making paradigms. This area has a greater degree of activation under stimulation tasks such as smell, hearing, language, and learning. Future meta-analyses should include a wider range of stimulus modalities and tasks. Finally, not all studies include voxel-based activation coordinates that would allow them to be included in ALE analysis. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nUsing a large-scale meta-analysis, this study has revealed the functional differentiation and integration of the caudate and putamen in the human dorsal striatum. The 15 different subregions identified are involved in the processing of different functions. The observed functional differentiation and integration of the dorsal striatum may constitute the link between these different functional systems and the transmission of information between them. We conducted a comprehensive summary and evaluation of the relevant brain cognitive neuroimaging literature. The ensuing results may benefit future research on depression, Parkinson\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, and other diseases. \n\n\n## Supplementary \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9816733,"text_md5":"dfa113e355f330046015c560a5360f2d","field_positions":{"authors":[0,96],"journal":[97,119],"publication_year":[121,125],"title":[136,232],"keywords":[246,387],"abstract":[400,2276],"body":[2285,35358]},"batch":1,"pmid":36620169,"doi":"10.21037\/qims-22-133","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9816733","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9816733"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9816733\">9816733<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9816733  Functional differentiation of the dorsal striatum: a coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis"}

Neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies show that the brain regions which respond to violations of social norms, the understanding of the mind of others and the executive functions, are involved during social punishment. Despite the rising number of studies on social punishment, the concordant map of activations - the set of key regions responsible for the general brain response to social punishment - is still unknown. By using coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis, the present study examined the concordant map of neural activations associated with various social punishment tasks. A total of 17 articles with 18 contrasts including 383 participants, equalling 191 foci were included in activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis. The majority of the studies (61%) employed the widely used neuroeconomic paradigms, such as fairness-related norm tasks (Ultimatum Game, third-party punishment game), while the remaining tasks reported criminal scenarios evaluation and social rejection tasks. The analysis revealed concordant activation in the bilateral claustrum, right interior frontal and left superior frontal gyri. This study provides an integrative view on brain responses to social punishment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCooperation is one of the mechanisms supporting the social order in society. The emergence and enforcement of cooperation in groups is one of the most fundamental questions, and many studies shed light on factors which are important to sustain and enforce cooperation in society, such as reciprocity and social punishment as a form of negative reciprocity . Social punishment is a sanctioning behaviour that occurs when a person with no apparent benefit (or even at a cost) to himself, punishes deviant behaviour that violates existing social norms . It exists in different forms, such as second-party and third-party punishment which is usually implemented in economic tasks, or as acts of aborting social interaction - social disapproval or rejection. When the punishment decision is implemented by the person who is affected during the norm violation, it is called \u201csecond-party punishment\u201d, otherwise if the person is uninvolved, but knows about the norm violation \u2013 it is called \u201cthird-party punishment\u201d . Behavioural economists suggest that third-party punishment may have emerged from second-party punishment . Thus, we could suggest that it would have some shared neural representations. \n\nRecent studies suggest that two main forms of social punishment \u2013 second-party and third-party punishment \u2013 share some common brain mechanisms, such as involvement of ventral striatum . However, the studies also report differences in the neural representation for these two forms of punishment: medial prefrontal cortex , right nucleus accumbens and bilateral cingulate , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), left anterior insula and amygdala . While looking for behavioural implications, Stallen   et al  .  showed, using a computational model, that willingness to punish in response to unfairness did not differ between second- and third-party punishment games; however, the severity of punishment is significantly higher for second-party situations. At the neural level the willingness to punish in both second- and third-party situations was associated with the right anterior insula\u2019s activation , while the activation of left anterior insula, rDLPFC and left amygdala and was specific for second-party\u2019s willingness to punish. Based on these findings, we expect that tasks related to social punishment will show concordant brain locations in ventral striatum and right anterior insula. \n\nIn addition, a recent review by Krueger and Hoffman  provides us with a neural framework for punishment that could offer some insights regarding the involvement of large-scale networks supporting third-party punishment: the salience network anchored in the anterior cingulate cortex, the mentalizing network \u2013 in the temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and central-executive network \u2013 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Recent fMRI study by Civai and colleagues  suggests that exploration of the similarities in neural processing of second-party and third-party punishment conditions could deep our knowledge in disentangling mechanisms associated with general punishment processes. However, no extensive review or meta-analytic study has been done on social punishment to address shared brain mechanisms for both second- and third-party punishment: a recent ALE meta-analysis was conducted on social norm representation and norm violations , revealing the distinct brain regions responsible for these two processes \u2013 the anterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus and insular cortex. The majority of the experiments testing social punishment focus on punishment in terms of direct material costs alone. However, initially  this has been done to control individual incentives and test exact theoretical predictions, while laboratory behaviour of meeting and avoiding punishment is similar to the disapproval and its avoidance in real life. Thus, social punishment should be seen more as different forms of social control , or judgments of disapproval and negative emotional responses to the norm violator , so the meta-analytic research should follow this logic to better estimate concordant activation to social punishment. Following this, the search for the current study was constructed to address different terms used to describe social punishment: social punishment, altruistic punishment, costly punishment - so different tasks from the punishment experiments would be included in the study to replicate a mechanism that supports cooperation and enforces social norms. The initial literature search performed in April, 2017, did not reveal enough studies eligible to be included in the analysis of general brain responses to social punishment. This study is an attempt to address this lack of knowledge and identify the concordant brain activations responsible for the processing of information related to social punishment. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nArticles included in the meta-analysis provided data on 383 participants (see Table\u00a0 ). Five articles did not report the gender of their final sample after all exclusions; of the remaining articles, 57% were female participants. Four articles did not report handedness (25%); of the remaining articles all tested participants were right-handed (100%). Five articles did not report the age of the final sample of the participants; of the remaining articles, the mean age range was 19.76\u201328.39 years. 50% of the articles did not report the education level of participants, while 100% of the participants of the remaining articles were reported to have some university education. Figure\u00a0  shows the number of articles, number of studies (experiments) and number of foci included in the meta-analysis.   \nDescriptive information of studies and experiments included. \n  \nNote: n\/r: not reported.

One with the highest likelihood of detection includes right claustrum and right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45). Other regions include the left claustrum and left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6).

The former corresponds to the region next to the insular cortex, which is considered in Krueger and Hoffman\u2019s model as part of the salience network. The latter corresponds to the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex represents the main node of central-executive network in Krueger and Hoffman\u2019s model. It needs to be taken into account that the analysis did not reveal concordant activation in any regions corresponding with the mentalizing network from the model. TPJ is a key node of the mentalizing network included in the model, whose activity is associated with the evaluation of the wrongdoer\u2019s mental state and his\/her intention . This could be explained by the heterogeneity of the studies included: the proportion of third-party and second-party punishment tasks is not equal, and it has been shown that second-party and third-party punishment tasks trigger different responses in the mentalizing system . The analysis did not reveal any concordant activation in ACC responsible for the initial evaluation of harm to the victim of the norm violation, according to the Krueger and Hoffman model. In general ACC activity is associated with error detection and performance monitoring . For social punishment, this suggests that ACC activity is required for the initial stages of punishment decision-making, like the evaluation of the current norm and a detection of the norm violation, which is consistent also with the results of the recent meta-analysis . As most studies included in the current meta-analysis used the contrasts where the participants were faced with the punishment decision of others\/make the punishment decision by themselves (assigning the rating, deducting the monetary units etc.), this could suggest that the final stages of punishment decision-making only require already available information about the harm done to the victim (associated with the insular\/claustrum activity) to make the final decision (which involves lateral prefrontal cortex\/inferior frontal gyrus activity). \n\nThe right inferior frontal gyrus is considered as a key region in the emotional empathy network . The activation of this region has been also associated with interpretation during interpersonal interactions  and an understanding of the intentions of others . The structural abnormalities of this region have been reported in association with the severity of symptoms in autism spectrum disorders, such as reduced cortical thickness  or the absence of functional activation . Based on these findings, it could be suggested that the activation of this part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex reflects the activation of the emotional empathy network required for the adequate response to social interaction. \n\nAccording to a recent meta-analysis, the concordant activation of the left claustrum is associated with norm violation tasks , although its direct role in social cognition is still unclear. However past hypotheses have suggested the role of the claustrum in mammals as an integrator of multimodal sensory information, though some recent findings do not confirm this notion ; this suggests its involvement in top-down control and encoding a preparatory signal in rat models . \n\nIt is important to note that emotional empathy networks, based on the concept of mirror neuron systems, are now claimed to include regions of the somatosensory cortex and anterior insula . Recent findings suggest that the right inferior frontal gyrus response triggers the activity in the anterior insula associated with emotional simulation , confirming its interaction during the evaluation of social-emotional events. Moreover, some researchers claim that the role of the anterior insula as a hub of salience networks could be confounded by its proximity to the claustrum , which is supported by findings on monkeys , suggesting that claustrum reacts to the novel and salient stimuli. Based on this, it could be suggested that activations of the claustrum in social punishment tasks are a function of salience detection. \n\nThe analysis also revealed the concordant activation in left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) for social punishment. This area could be divided into three functional subdivisions - supplementary motor area, the dorsal and ventral parts of lateral premotor cortex . The findings suggest that various tasks could activate different parts of this area. The medial part of BA 6 corresponds to the supplementary motor area, whose main functions are motor learning and planning , however, as part of DLPFC, is it also involved in working memory . Lesion studies suggest that the impairment of the left superior frontal gyrus is associated with working memory deficits . Schizophrenia patient studies also confirm the role of this region in working memory, showing a higher activation of the left superior frontal gyrus during more complex working memory tasks . The involvement of the activity of this region in working memory tasks is also supported by findings on healthy subjects, addressed in particular to task-switching . The rostral part of BA 6, however, is activated in mental-operation tasks without motor responses involved . Some studies also linked BA 6\u2019s activation with number multiplication and comparison  and spatial imagery , which suggests that the activation of this area could be responsible for the interaction of cognitive information processing and motor control. \n\nThe data presented here represent concordant neural activation across studies that mostly investigated the brain responses of punishers (fifteen studies out of seventeen) using neuroeconomic paradigms (eleven out of seventeen). The optimal approach would be possible with the further implementation of subcategories (i.e. second- vs third-party punishment; experience of receiving the punishment vs application of the punishment to the other person). In accordance with current guidelines , the number of experiments in these subcategories does not allow us to continue the examination of the concordance. \n\nThe current study employed ALE approach to investigate concordant activations to social punishment, following the model of Krueger and Hoffman. An alternative solution would be to perform additional analysis, such as Meta-Analytic Connectivity Mapping (MACM) to relate the ALE findings to an underlying network. However, the results of the literature review on the Sleuth database meant the inability to perform such an additional analysis. Two strategies were developed: (1) to perform MACM to look at the results of current ALE meta-analysis, (2) to perform MACM for the key brain areas included in Krueger and Hoffman\u2019s model to see the connectivity map. As suggested in GingerALE guideline and published in several papers of the developers of this software , the search for the corresponding activations was performed via Sleuth database with the following criteria: \u201cContext: Normal Mapping\u201d, \u201cActivations Only\u201d, \u201cBehavioral Domain: Emotion - Negative: Punishment\/Loss OR Cognition: Social cognition\u201d and for TD label we put the name of brain area of interest (\u201cclaustrum\u201d, \u201cinferior frontal gyrus\u201d, \u201csuperior frontal gyrus\u201d). After that all papers were visually inspect to see, if the described study was performed about social punishment. Unfortunately, the database revealed too few results for all keywords: only two experiments from the two articles belong to social punishment, but both of them appeared in \u201c\u0441laustrum\u201d and \u201cinferior frontal gyrus\u201d Sleuth searches. \n\nFollowing the same steps of extracting the information from the Sleuth database for the second MACM search, only two eligible experiments were found for \u201cinsula\u201d, no experiments for \u201canterior cingulate\u201d, one experiment for \u201cposterior cingulate\u201d, three eligible experiments for \u201camygdala\u201d and so forth. Despite such an analysis being very important improvement to this study allowing a detailed evaluation of the concordant activations and co-activations across social punishment studies, the Sleuth database does not contain enough information to perform such a study. This could be considered as a shortcoming of the current study, which should be addressed in future studies. \n\nTo sum up, the concordance across studies of social punishment has been observed in the bilateral claustrum, right interior frontal and left superior frontal gyri - areas related to salience and the central-executive network. The data obtained here on typical adults provide a stereotaxic set of brain regions which could serve as regions of interest to guide future research in this field. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nIn comparison to previous meta-analyses conducted on fMRI results of brain activations to specific economic tasks (Ultimatum Game ; Trust Game ), the scope of this meta-analysis is an investigation of the general brain responses to social punishment. In accordance with Muller and colleagues , to answer this research question the analysis was not limited to a specific paradigm (e.g., Ultimatum Game or Dictator Game with punishment condition), but all paradigms were considered, which allow focusing on the higher order processes necessary in all tasks related to social punishment. Importantly, it required the balancing of the distribution of experiments across tasks  and consideration of the problem of the results\u2019 generalization, because the specific types of experiments could drive the results. Therefore, the literature search was defined to account for the data reported for the behavioral phenomenon (social punishment, altruistic punishment, costly punishment) rather than specific task, such as Ultimatum Game or third-party punishment game (for the similar approach in social neuroscience meta-analyses see the following ). \n\nThe literature search was performed on the 25  of May 2018 using the Web of Science Core Collection search engine ( ) and PubMed database ( ) using the following keywords: \u201cfMRI AND social punishment\u201d, \u201cfMRI AND costly punishment\u201d, and \u201cfMRI AND altruistic punishment\u201d. The search yielded 211 articles. The search was updated on 15  of April, 2019 to include articles published and included into databases from 25  of May, yielding 222 articles. After removing duplicates and non-full-text articles, the articles were screened for eligibility using the following exclusion criteria: articles reporting data on children, patients and drug administration, no fMRI data or only region of interest (ROI) data, between-group analysis, non-relevant tasks or review articles were excluded (see Fig.\u00a0  for the PRISMA chart). Only studies reporting whole-brain analysis results in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) spaces for healthy, human adults were included. Due to the different spatial and temporal resolutions between fMRI, positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), only data from fMRI studies were included, while PET and MEG studies were excluded from the search criteria to achieve the homogeneity of imaging data. The articles eligible for the meta-analysis were also screened for the tasks eligible to avoid possible overlapping with the results of previous study on brain responses to social norms and its violations  and to confirm the same contrasts would not be included into different analyses. This yielded 17 articles with 18 contrasts, and 191 foci eligible for meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Article selection \n  \nThe main objective of this meta-analysis is to understand how the brain processes information regarding altruistic or social punishment. To achieve this, studies that reported brain activations as a response to negative outcomes (i.e. game losses vs. wins only) were not included; only those that reported them in the context of social situations were included, such those using fairness-related norm tasks (Ultimatum Game, Dictator Game) and social rejection tasks (Cyberball game, modified social incentive delay task). While for second-party punishment the main form of punishment decision was rejection behaviour (directly leading to financial losses of the wrongdoer or perceived as a social disapproval - an unpleasant outcome), the third-party punishment decisions included different forms of punishment behaviour: from direct investment of the third-party\u2019s own resources in economic tasks to punishment ratings evaluating the power of punishment assigned to the wrongdoer in criminal scenarios. \n\nThe majority of studies used fairness-related norm tasks and neuroeconomic paradigms, such as Ultimatum Game or third-party punishment game (61%), while three used norm-violation scenarios and vignettes with a punishment questionnaire , one used social incentive delay tasks , one used the Cyberball paradigm with punishment questionnaire  and one a perceptual task with social feedback . The insufficient number of experiments (<17) did not allow for examining concordance in the subcategories for second-party punishment and third-party punishment . In the following studies, participants were made to experience punishment in the form of social disapproval  or direct financial losses , while another afforded participants the possibility to punish the inappropriate behaviour of another person (for instance, assign the punishment rating or reject the proposed offer) . \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis \n  \nThis coordinate-based meta-analysis was conducted using GingerALE software (2.3.6), freely available on  . This method allows using foci from different articles to create a probabilistic map of activations that is compared to random spatial distributions. The significance of the data has been assessed using a cluster-level threshold for multiple comparisons at p\u2009=\u20090.05 with a cluster-forming threshold set to p\u2009=\u20090.001 . \n\n\n### Ethical approval \n  \nThis article does not contain any studies with human participants directly performed by any of the authors. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6728376,"text_md5":"d85c9dc0f42b213c8fdf7545dbae7ae5","field_positions":{"authors":[0,17],"journal":[18,25],"publication_year":[27,31],"title":[42,95],"keywords":[109,130],"abstract":[143,1490],"body":[1499,22291]},"batch":1,"pmid":31488865,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-019-49239-1","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6728376","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6728376"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6728376\">6728376<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6728376  Brain responses to social punishment: a meta-analysis"}

Collective analysis across such neuroimaging experiments may answer broader questions regarding how naturalistic cognition is biologically distributed throughout the brain. We applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach that uses   k  -means clustering to identify core brain networks engaged across the naturalistic functional neuroimaging literature. Functional decoding allowed us to, then, delineate how information is distributed between these networks throughout the execution of dynamical cognition in realistic settings. This analysis revealed six recurrent patterns of brain activation, representing sensory, domain-specific, and attentional neural networks that support the cognitive demands of naturalistic paradigms. Although gaps in the literature remain, these results suggest that naturalistic fMRI paradigms recruit a common set of networks that allow both separate processing of different streams of information and integration of relevant information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior. \n   Author Summary  \nNaturalistic fMRI paradigms offer increased ecological validity over traditional paradigms, addressing the gap left by studying highly interactive cognitive processes as isolated neural phenomena. This study identifies the connectional architecture supporting dynamic cognition in naturalistic fMRI paradigms, the first meta-analysis of a wide range of more realistic neuroimaging experiments. Here we identify and characterize six core patterns of neural activity that support functional segregation and integration in large-scale brain networks. This study provides a unique investigation of the cooperating neural systems that enable complex behavior. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAcross the life sciences, researchers often seek a balance between ecological validity and careful laboratory control when making experimental design decisions. This entails weighing the value of creating realistic stimuli representative of real-world, interactive experiences versus artificial, reductionist stimuli facilitating precise assessment of \u201cisolated\u201d mental process of interest via cognitive subtraction.   assumes that a single added cognitive process does not alter the other, co-occurring processes, both neutrally and cognitively. As such, task-based fMRI has traditionally utilized precisely controlled tasks to study the neurobiological substrates of cognition. However, cognition does not occur by pure insertion; the functioning of any cognitive process is not wholly independent from other co-occurring processes (Friston et al.,  ). Instead, cognition is highly interactive, encompassing measurable changes in neural activity that are dependent on the full amalgamation of relevant social, cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes. Thus, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect findings from a highly restricted assessment of a psychological construct in the scanner to fully generalize to real-world behaviors and settings. \n\nWith advances in technology and a desire to study cognition with greater ecological validity, increasing numbers of studies are utilizing realistic, interactive, and rich stimuli in more ecologically valid experimental designs that fit within the scanner\u2019s confines (Hasson & Honey,  ; Maguire,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \u201cNaturalistic\u201d paradigms employ dynamic and complex stimuli (Fehr et al.,  ; Kauttonen et al.,  ; Burunat et al.,  ), in terms of multimodal demands (Lahnakoski et al.,  ; Maguire,  ; Nardo et al.,  ; Dick et al.,  ; Reed et al.,  ; Bishop & Miller,  ), or in relation to the length of the stimulus presentation (Maguire,  ; Cong et al.,  ). Specifically, the use of video games, film clips, and virtual reality, among others, has brought a new dimension to cognitive neuroimaging experiments, permitting researchers to study brain activity as participants engage in tasks that more closely represent real-life demands on attention and multimodal sensory integration. Appreciation of such attention and integration processes necessitates more complex stimuli than simple static images presented on a screen. For example, researchers have studied spatial navigation with virtual reality environments as complex as the city of London (Spiers & Maguire,  ) and as classic as a virtual radial arm maze (Marsh et al.,  ). Similarly, social cognition has been probed with displays of human social interactions from a dramatic, social television drama (Spunt & Lieberman,  ) to clips of facial expressions with little context (Li et al.,  ). \n\nEveryday activities, such as navigation or social observation, involve the integration of processes associated with object recognition, speech comprehension, motor control, and spatial orienting, which all require the interpretation of dynamic signals often from more than one sensory modality (e.g., audiovisual film watching or visuotactile image tracing) and necessitate different attentional demands compared with the simplistic stimuli used in traditional fMRI experiments (Giard & Peronnet,  ; McGurk & MacDonald,  ; Sailer et al.,  ; Spence,  ). Recently, this trend has produced open-source efforts such as studyforrest, a freely available dataset of MRI scans, eye-tracking, and extensive annotations, using the movie   Forrest Gump   as a rich, multimodal stimulus ( ; Hanke et al.,  ,  ,  ). Although studies of participants freely viewing films or navigating virtual environments have been used since the early days of fMRI, the naturalistic studies represent a small portion of the overall task-based fMRI literature (Beauregard et al.,  ; Burgess et al.,  ; Maguire,  ). Despite offering advantages, the growing body of naturalistic fMRI research has yet to be quantitatively assessed, and little is known of how the neural bases of these tasks support complex information processing and behavioral demands. \n\nHere, we applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach to quantitatively explore and classify knowledge embedded in the naturalistic fMRI literature. Using an approach developed by Laird et al. ( ), we capitalized on the wealth and flexibility of published naturalistic paradigms and investigated recurrent patterns of brain activation reported across a wide variety of tasks and behaviors of interest. This method is based on the premise that functionally similar tasks engage spatially similar patterns of brain activity and that by clustering activation patterns from experimental contrasts, similar experimental paradigms can be identified. Naturalistic paradigms are uniquely rich here because of the multitude of component processes contributing to realistic behavior that can be illuminated by modeling strategies in data analysis. To this end, we extracted relevant information about the stimuli and task demands of these paradigms and assessed motifs in the arrangement of this information, with respect the data-driven clustering analysis, to determine which paradigm aspects elicited activation patterns that subserve common and dissociable cognitive processes. Although naturalistic paradigms vary greatly and are designed to probe a wide range of psychological constructs and behaviors, we hypothesized that complex, multisensory processing are associated with a set of core neural networks engaged by similar content domains and task demands. The objectives of this study were to first elucidate core brain networks engaged by the myriad processes that underlie behavior during naturalistic fMRI paradigms and then to characterize how information processing is potentially distributed between these networks to facilitate complex behaviors in realistic settings. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Naturalistic fMRI Paradigms \n  \nHere, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d paradigms were operationally defined as tasks employing any stimulus that demanded continuous, real-time integration of dynamic streams of information. This definition excludes any paradigms based on still-frame stimulus presentation, which intrinsically impose static constraints that are rarely present in the world and, thus, limit ecologically their validity. Importantly, a key distinction of naturalistic tasks is that stimuli are continuously presented across the duration of the task, whereas other tasks in the literature rely on repeated trials of stimuli. As real-world behavior contextually involves all sensory modalities, we included naturalistic tasks in which such stimuli were presented via the visual, auditory, or tactile modalities or any combination thereof. Visual naturalistic tasks require either a real-time interaction with visual stimuli, in the case of video games and virtual reality, or the continuous integration of real-time information, such as during film viewing. Auditory tasks, including the perception of music and spoken stories, similarly require the continuous integration of, and often interaction with, real-time information. Our operational definition also included tactile naturalistic paradigms, which involve the manipulation and recognition of physical objects. During these tactile tasks, participants gather and integrate sensory information to create a mental representation of the object and, if necessary, form an appropriate behavioral response. Lastly, we note the inclusion of multisensory tasks. As in life, many naturalistic experiments simultaneously present auditory, visual, and tactile information, and such tasks demand the real-time integration of information from multiple sensory modalities. \n\n\n### Literature Search, Filtering, and Annotation \n  \nAn extensive literature search was performed to amass a corpus of naturalistic fMRI studies that were published since the emergence of fMRI in 1992. To identify published naturalistic fMRI studies, PubMed searches were carried out by focusing on stimulus types common to naturalistic research (e.g., video games, film, virtual reality). The first search string, performed on January 13, 2016, used the following string to identify relevant studies by their titles and abstracts: ((\u201cnaturalistic\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201creal-world\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cecologically valid\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201ctrue-to-life\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201crealistic\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cvideo game\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cfilm\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cmovie\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cvirtual reality\u201d[Title\/Abstract]) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d[Title\/Abstract]) AND (\u201cHumans\u201d[MeSH])). This search yielded 679 studies (January 2016), some of which utilized stimulus types that we had not included in our initial query, including music, speech, and tactile objects. To identify any studies using these tasks that may not have been returned by the initial query, a second search was performed on January 20, 2016, using the string ((\u201cmusic\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cspeech\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cspoken\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201ctactile object\u201d[Title\/Abstract]) AND (\u201cnaturalistic\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201creal-world\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cecologically valid\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201ctrue-to-life\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201crealistic\u201d[Title\/Abstract]) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d[Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d[Title\/Abstract]) AND \u201cHumans\u201d[MeSH]). This secondary search returned 48 studies, some of which were included in the results of the first search. The two sets of search results were pooled to identify 754 unique studies, which were then reviewed and filtered to identify studies utilizing naturalistic paradigms as defined above. \n\nEach of 754 candidate studies was first screened and then reviewed according to the following exclusion criteria ( ; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & Altman,  ). The screening process examined the Abstracts and Methods of each paper to exclude nonnaturalistic tasks in which static, timed blocks of stimuli were presented with a well-defined window for participant response. In this step, we also excluded studies that assessed training or learning across multiple trials or across some period of practice (e.g., pre- vs. post contrasts), as our focus was on neural underpinnings of the tasks themselves and not training-induced changes thereof. In determining eligibility of each paper, studies of participants under the age of 18 or of participants with any history of neurological or psychiatric diagnosis were excluded. After this study-level examination, we then inspected each reported experimental contrast within each paper. In this context, \u201cexperiment\u201d represents each statistical parametric image presented, as the result of some functional image data analysis, such as contrasting experimental conditions (Fox et al.,  ). Experiments from analyses that used an a priori region(s) of interest to investigate activation or functional connectivity were omitted permitting identification of whole-brain neural networks. We also excluded contrasts modeling ANOVA interaction-specific activations because of the inherent complexity of such effects. In this step, any studies\/contrasts that did not meet the minimum requirements for coordinate-based meta-analysis, reporting the brain activation locations in a three-dimensional, standardized coordinate space, were discarded. \n  \n of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each of the experiments returned by the PubMed queries were screened according to this schematic. \n  \nDuring inspection of each contrast, one study associate (KLB) manually annotated each experiment with terms that described the experimental design with respect to stimulus type utilized, sensory modality engaged, and the task nature. These terms described the salient aspects of the stimuli and behaviors associated with each individual experimental contrast from the corpus of naturalistic paradigms, annotating the particular aspects of the tasks highlighted by each modeled experimental contrast, and not the intended psychological construct interrogated by the original report. These manual annotations were then independently reviewed and confirmed by a second study associate (JSF) to assure consistency and accuracy. Any disagreements or inconsistencies between KLB and JSF were resolved following a final conversation between the two associates. \n\n\n### Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis \n  \n#### . \n  \nFollowing the identification of relevant papers and experiments\/contrasts, reported brain activation coordinates were extracted. All Talairach atlas-based coordinates (Talairach & Tournoux,  ) were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Collins et al.,  ; Evans et al.,  ) using the tal2icbm transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). Probabilistic modeled activation (MA) maps were created from the foci reported in each individual contrast by modeling a spherical Gaussian blur around each focus, with full width at half maximum determined by the number of subjects in each experiment in order to represent the uncertainty induced by the inherent variability from individual differences and between-lab differences (Eickhoff et al.,  ). These MA maps were concatenated into an array of   n   experiments by   p   voxels, which was then analyzed for pairwise correlations that reflected the degree of spatial similarity between the MA maps from each of the   n   experiments and those of every other experiment. The resultant   n   \u00d7   n   correlation matrix represented the similarity of spatial topography of MA maps between every possible pair of experiments. \n\n\n####  analysis. \n  \nIndividual naturalistic experiments (  n   MA maps) were then classified into   K   groups based on their spatial topography similarities. The   k  -means clustering procedure was performed in Matlab (Mathworks, R2013b for Linux), which grouped experiments by pairwise similarity, calculating correlation distance by 1 minus the correlation between MA maps (from the aforementioned correlation matrix) and finding the \u201cbest\u201d grouping by minimizing the sum of correlation distances within each cluster (code available at  ). This approach begins by choosing   K   arbitrary maps as representative centroids for each of the   K   clusters and assigning experiments to each cluster based on the closest (most similar) centroid. This process continued iteratively until a stable solution was reached. \n\nSolutions were investigated for a range of   K   = 2\u201310 clusters. Once the clustering analysis was complete for all   K  , we compared each solution with the neighboring solutions and assessed for improvement across parcellation schemes by using four metrics describing cluster separation and stability (Bzdok et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). This allowed us to objectively select the number of clusters that most optimally divided the dataset. The first metric,   average cluster silhouette   across clustering solutions, assessed the separation between clusters and described whether clusters were distinct or overlapping. A higher silhouette value indicates that greater separation is ideal and that each experiment fits well into its cluster, with lower misclassification likelihood of fringe experiments into neighboring clusters. Stability is indicated by a relatively minimal change in silhouette from one solution (  K  ) to the next (  K   + 1), indicated by the positive derivative of the silhouette score closest to zero, with greatest stability evidenced by the smallest change between two points. Second, we considered the   consistency of experiment assignment   by comparing the ratio of the minimum number of experiments consistently assigned to a cluster relative to the mean number of experiments consistently assigned to that cluster. In this case, only ratios above 0.5, in which at least half of the experiments were consistently assigned, were considered viable solutions. Third, the   variation of information   was quantified, which compared the entropy of clusters with the mutual information shared between them for each solution   K   and its   K   \u2212 1 and   K   + 1 neighbors. A large decrease in variation of information from   K   \u2212 1 to   K   and increase from   K   to   K   + 1, a local minimum in the plot of variation of information across   K  , indicated a decrease in overlap between solutions and, thus, stability of solution   K  . In this case, \u201clarge\u201d is defined, too, in relative terms, with the largest decrease indicating greatest stability of the solutions considered. Finally, we computed a   hierarchy index   for each solution, which assessed how clusters split from the   K   \u2212 1 to   K   solution to form the additional cluster. A lower hierarchy index indicated that clusters present in   K   stemmed from fewer of the clusters present in   K   \u2212 1, another indication of stability in groupings demonstrated by a local minimum across values of   K  . An optimal clustering solution is one that demonstrated minimal overlap between clusters (i.e., high silhouette value), while exhibiting relative stability in comparison with the previous and next solutions (i.e., consistency > 0.5, a local minimum in variation of information, and lower hierarchy index than previous). \n\n\n#### Meta-analytic groupings. \n  \nFrom the identified optimal clustering solution, we probed the underlying neural topography associated with each of the   K   groups of experiments (Laird et al.,  ). To this end, the   meta-analysis algorithm (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) was applied to generate a map of convergent activation for each grouping of experiments with similar topography. The ALE algorithm includes a weighting of the number of subjects when computing these maps of convergent activation and accounts for uncertainty associated with individual, template, and registration differences between and across experiments (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The union of these probability distributions was used to calculate ALE scores, a quantitative assessment of convergence between brain activation across different experiments, which was compared against 1,000 permutations of a null distribution of random spatial arrangements (Eickhoff et al.,  ). These ALE values for each meta-analytic grouping of experiments were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 (cluster-level corrected for family-wise error) with a voxel-level, cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Woo et al.,  ). The resultant ALE maps thus reflected the convergent activation patterns within each of the   K   clusters. The experimental   K   clusters are hereafter referred to as  , representing meta-analytic groups of experiments demonstrating similar activation patterns. \n\n\n\n### \n  \nOnce we elucidated convergent activation patterns within MAGs, we sought to gain insight into what aspects of the naturalistic paradigms were most frequently associated with each MAG via functional decoding. Functional decoding is a quantitative, data-driven method by which researchers can infer which mental processes are related to activation in a specific brain region (or set of brain regions) across published fMRI studies. We chose to use two complementary functional decoding approaches, one based on our study-specific, subjective manual annotations mentioned above, and another based on the objective, automated annotations provided by the Neurosynth database for over 11,000 functional neuroimaging studies (Yarkoni et al.,  ;  ). First, the manually annotated terms associated with each experiment were grouped into the MAGs identified above and were assessed by frequency of occurrence in each MAG. The distribution of stimulus modality, stimulus type, and salient terms across MAGs allowed us to evaluate the relationship between activation patterns and the aspects of naturalistic paradigms that elicited them. Second, we included an automated, data-driven annotation method using Neurosynth, which includes automatically extracted terms that occur at a high frequency in the abstract of each archived study. To functionally decode our MAGs, we compared the MAGs\u2019 activation patterns with those reported across published neuroimaging papers in the Neurosynth database. To this end, we uploaded each ALE map to NeuroVault, a web-based repository for 3D statistical neuroimaging maps that directly interfaces with Neurosynth (Gorgolewski et al.,  ;  ). NeuroVault enables \u201cfunctional decoding\u201d by correlating unthresholded uploaded maps with term-specific meta-analytic maps extracted from Neurosynth\u2019s database of published functional neuroimaging studies. The Neurosynth functional decoding results were exported as a set of terms and correlation values representing how well the spatial distribution of activation associated with each term in the database matched the activation pattern of the uploaded map. \n\nBoth sets of terms (i.e., obtained via manual and automated approaches) were evaluated to assess the specific aspects of naturalistic paradigms associated with each MAG. The Neurosynth terms representing broad behavioral aspects across fMRI studies that elicit similar brain activation profiles provides both an unbiased description of the experiments engaging each MAG, as well as a comparison of our corpus of studies with the broader literature. On the other hand, manual annotation provides a more concise, accurate description of the paradigms, although it is predisposed to the subjective bias of human annotation. The results of this two-pronged functional decoding approach were designed to describe the processes that engage brain networks similar to each MAG and how these processes may be similar or different in naturalistic fMRI studies compared with the broader functional neuroimaging literature. The distribution of stimulus modalities and types across MAGs was assessed, too. Together, the functional decoding results and distributions of different stimuli were interpreted to provide insight into how information processing is functionally segregated across cooperating neural systems during naturalistic tasks. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nThe literature search yielded a combined set of 110 studies that reported coordinates of brain activation from naturalistic fMRI tasks among healthy adults ( ; PubMed IDs available in Supporting Information Table S1, Bottenhorn, Flannery, Boeving, Riedel, Eickhoff, Sutherland, & Laird,  ). The final dataset included activation foci from 376 experimental contrasts (  N   = 1,817 subjects) derived from tasks using a variety of stimulus types and sensory modalities. Across our corpus of naturalistic fMRI experiments, approximately 55% assessed a single stimulus modality, including 40% visual stimuli, 13% auditory, and 1% tactile. \n\nConversely, 45% of experiments utilized multisensory stimuli, including 41% that employed audiovisual stimuli, 2% in which a visual stimulus was paired with painful, tactile stimuli, and 1% pairing visual and nonpainful tactile stimuli ( ). Of the visual experiments, 69% involved a motor response, as did 25% of the audiovisual experiments, ranging from a button press to joystick and object manipulation. The stimulus types most frequently used across the included experiments were films (45%), virtual reality (32%), speech (9%), and music (6%) ( ). \n  \nDistribution of stimulus modalities across the naturalistic corpus \n      \nDistribution of stimulus types across the naturalistic corpus \n    \n###  k  -Means Clustering Solutions \n  \nMA maps were created for each contrast and then clustered to identify groups with similar activation topographies. For completeness, the   k  -means clustering solutions for   K   = 2\u201310 clusters were quantitatively evaluated across four metrics to identify an optimal solution ( ). When considering the average silhouette metric ( ), values generally increased as   K   increased and the   smallest increase   was observed between   K   = 6 to   K   = 7, indicating little additional separation between clusters gained by moving from 6 to 7 clusters. With respect to the consistency of assigned experiments metric ( ), each of the solutions   K   = 2\u201310 met the stability requirement whereby the minimum number of experiments included in any iteration of the solution was at least 50% of the mean number of experiments included across iterations. The variation of information metric ( ), suggested the stability of a 6-cluster solution as parameter value   decreases   were observed when moving from   K   = 5 to   K   = 6, combined with parameter   increases   when moving from   K   = 6 to   K   = 7, indicating that a 6-cluster solution demonstrates relative stability. The hierarchy index metric ( ) further corroborated a 6-cluster solution, as a local minimum as observed at   K   = 6. Because of agreement across these metrics, we chose to proceed with the   K   = 6 solution. \n  \nMetrics computed for   K   = 2\u201310 clustering solutions. (A) The average cluster silhouette for each solution   K   from 2 to 10 clusters, showing the distribution of average silhouette values at each value of   K  , resampled 100 times leaving one random experiment out each time. (B) Consistency in experiments assignment to clusters, plotting the minimum consistently assigned clusters next to the mean of consistently assigned clusters. (C) The change in variation of information, a distance metric, from the   K   \u2212 1 to   K   and from   K   to   K   + 1. (D) The hierarchy index for each of   K   clustering solutions, which provides information about how clusters in the   K   solution stemmed from clusters in the   K   \u2212 1 solution. \n  \n\n### Meta-Analytic Groupings \n  \nThe optimal clustering solution yielded six MAGs of experiments in our corpus, suggesting similarities in brain activation across this sample of the naturalistic literature coalesce into six distinct patterns. The number of experiments that were clustered into each MAG ranged from 50 to 83 experiments (mean = 62.67;   SD   = 12.46). ALE maps of the six MAGs were generated and demonstrated little overlap in activation patterns, suggesting distinct patterns of recurrent activation across our set of naturalistic experiments ( ; Supporting Information Table S2, Bottenhorn et al.,  ). Whereas some of the MAGs exhibited focal patterns of convergent activation, restricted to a single or neighboring gyri (e.g., MAG 1 and 5), others presented with distributed convergence across multiple lobes (e.g., MAG 2 and 6). Most of the resulting MAGs were restricted to cortical activation patterns, although MAG 3 exhibited convergent activation in subcortical and brainstem regions (results available on NeuroVault at  ). \n  \nConvergent activation patterns of MAGs from the naturalistic corpus. ALE meta-analysis of experiments in each MAG yielded six patterns of convergent activation. \n  \nMAG 1 included convergent activation in the bilateral posterior temporal areas, including portions of the inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri, extending into the inferior parietal lobule and into the middle occipital gyrus, as well as in the left supramarginal gyrus, right precentral and middle frontal gyri, and in the bilateral precuneus. MAG 2 exhibited convergence in left inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, anterior and posterior aspects of the middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, in addition to both the left and right superior frontal gyri. MAG 3 demonstrated a largely symmetric convergence pattern across multiple subcortical structures including bilateral amygdalae, putamen, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and periaqueductal gray, with cortical clusters observed in the left inferior frontal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral fusiform gyri. MAG 4 exhibited convergent activation in bilateral medial temporal lobes, parahippocampal regions, bilateral precuneus, retrospenial posterior cingulate cortex, occipital regions including the lingual gyrus, right calcarine sulcus, and cuneus, in addition to a small, bilateral portion of the middle frontal gyri. MAG 5 showed convergence in the bilateral superior temporal gyri. MAG 6 demonstrated convergence in the bilateral superior frontal sulci, intraparietal sulci, and superior parietal lobules as well as convergence in higher order visual processing areas in the middle occipital and lingual gyri. \n\n\n### Stimulus Distribution Across MAGs \n  \nEach stimulus modality was represented in multiple MAGs, but modalities were not evenly distributed across MAGs ( ). Experiments utilizing audiovisual tasks were somewhat uniformly distributed across the MAGs, with a slightly higher proportion of audiovisual tasks in MAGs 1, 3, and 5. In contrast, more than half of the experiments using auditory tasks were grouped into MAGs 2 and 6. Notably, more experiments based on auditory and audiovisual stimuli were clustered into MAG 5 than any other MAG. Experiments in which participants experienced physical pain were not present in MAGs 1, 5, and 6, but distributed nearly evenly among MAGs 2 through 4, with a slightly higher portion in MAG 3. More than half of experiments that used tactile stimuli were grouped into MAG 5 and 6. Visual experiments were more evenly distributed across clusters, although there was a markedly smaller proportion in MAG 5 than any other MAG. One stimulus type, \u201csounds,\u201d was represented only once across the corpus and was, thus, excluded from  . The complete distribution of stimulus modalities across MAGs is provided in Supporting Information Table S3 (Bottenhorn et al.,  ). \n  \nDistribution of stimulus modalities and types across MAGs. (A) The presence of each sensory modality across the corpus that is associated with each MAG. (B) The proportion of each stimulus type present within the corpus that is associated with each MAG. These percentages represent the proportion modality or stimulus type present in each MAG, compared with the total count of that modality or stimulus type across all MAGs. \n  \nAs with stimulus modality, most stimulus types showed unequal, but not necessarily selective, distribution across MAGs ( ). Film-based experiments were uniformly distributed across MAGs, and tasks utilizing spoken stimuli were more frequently grouped into MAGs 2 and 5. Again, auditory stimuli were highly associated with MAG 5, as more than 50% of music experiments and 20% of speech experiments were clustered into MAG 5. Experiments that required subjects to play video games were most often grouped into MAGs 4 and 6. Experimental contrasts, which included a condition in which participants received tactile stimulation or manipulated tactile objects, were most prevalent in MAGs 3 and 6. A detailed distribution of stimulus types across MAGs is shown in Supporting Information Table S4 (Bottenhorn et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Functional Decoding \n  \nTwo approaches for functionally decoding each MAG, manual and automated annotations, were performed to develop a functional interpretation of each MAG\u2019s association with aspects of naturalistic paradigms. \n\n#### Manual annotations. \n  \nOur manual annotations utilized a list of 26 corpus-specific metadata terms, which captured salient features of the naturalistic design, rather than the psychological constructs assumed to be involved.   displays each of these terms and their frequency of occurrence across MAGs and across the entire corpus (Column = \u201cTotal\u201d), highlighting which terms described the largest number of experiments (e.g., \u201c  navigation  ,\u201d \u201c  visual features  ,\u201d \u201c  emotional film  ,\u201d \u201c  attention  \u201d), as well as those that accounted for a minimal number of experiments (e.g., \u201c  violence  ,\u201d \u201c  tactile  ,\u201d \u201c  pain  \u201d). Values in   indicate the percent of experiments labeled with each term, or the base rate of each term throughout the dataset, keeping in mind that each experiment was labeled with only one or two terms. Once the experiments were clustered into six MAGs, we evaluated the relative contributions of each term per MAG, controlling for base rate by dividing each term\u2019s per-MAG count by that term\u2019s total count across the corpus ( ). We assessed, too, the ability of each term to predict whether an experiment labeled with that term will be clustered into each MAG, (P(MAG|term)) or \u201cforward inference,\u201d and the ability of belongingness to each MAG to predict whether an experiment will be labeled with a particular term, (P(term|MAG)) or \u201creverse inference.\u201d These outcomes provide the association of each term with each MAG ( ). Some of the terms in the manual annotation analysis corresponded to stimulus types in   (e.g., per-MAG distribution for \u201c  music  \u201d and \u201c  video game  \u201d). However, many of the manually derived terms highlighted experimental aspects that reflect the unique and salient features of the naturalistic corpus (e.g., \u201c  anthropomorphic  ,\u201d \u201c  violence  \u201d) and are not included in standard neuroimaging paradigm ontologies such as BrainMap (Fox et al.,  ) or CogPO (Turner & Laird,  ). \n  \nManual functional decoding results across meta-analytic groupings \n    \n\n#### Automated Neurosynth annotations. \n  \nTo complement the manual annotation analysis, we used Neurosynth\u2019s automated annotations, which describes experiments that engage each MAG based on published neuroimaging data, allowing comparison of our corpus with the broader literature. MAG results were decoded in Neurosynth, yielding correlation values indicating the similarity of the input map (i.e., each MAG\u2019s ALE map) and maps associated with each term from the Neurosynth database. To facilitate interpretation, the top 10 terms with the highest correlation values for each MAG are presented ( ). Terms that were near-duplicates of terms already included in the list were removed, such as \u201c  emotion  \u201d and \u201c  emotions  \u201d if \u201c  emotional  \u201d was higher on the list. Noncontent terms (e.g., \u201c  abstract  ,\u201d \u201c  reliable  \u201d) and terms that described brain regions, such as \u201c  insula  \u201d or \u201c  mt  ,\u201d were also excluded. \n  \nAutomated functional decoding results from Neurosynth \n    \n\n#### Functional interpretation of MAGs. \n  \nThe combined knowledge gained from the MAGs topography, as well as the manual and automated metadata decoding analyses, provided insight into the functional interpretation of the clustering results. Overall, the terms yielded by Neurosynth decoding generally agreed with the manual annotation terms in characterizing the MAGs. Below is a summary of the six MAGs; note that reported labels do not refer to the definitive function of these regions, but rather indicate how each MAG reflects differential network contributions during naturalistic fMRI paradigms. \n\nManual annotations indicated that MAG 1 experiments involved attention and the processing of dynamic visual features, in addition to visually presented anthropomorphic forms and faces. Most of the stimuli in these experiments were films ( ), especially affective films. Neurosynth results largely converged with these manual annotations, as terms including \u201c  videos  ,\u201d \u201c  body  \u201d, \u201c  observation  ,\u201d and \u201c  visual motion  \u201d ( ) were associated with activations in MAG 1 regions. These annotations, together with the presence of convergent activation across regions commonly associated with higher level visual processing, suggest that MAG 1 was associated with the observation of body and biological motion ( ). \n\nManual annotations indicated that MAG 2 experiments involved language processing, inference, and judgments about congruence. This MAG included relatively large proportions of the experiments using speech, video games, and tactile stimulation ( ). Neurosynth results supported the manual annotations\u2019 indication that this MAG was associated with language processing and comprehension, as terms such as \u201c  sentence  ,\u201d \u201c  comprehension  ,\u201d \u201c  semantic  ,\u201d and \u201c  mentalizing  \u201d ( ) were returned. These annotations and the presence of convergent activation in predominately left lateralized regions typically associated with higher order cognition and language suggest that MAG 2 related to language processing ( ). \n\nManual annotations indicated that MAG 3 experiments involved human interactions or affective displays, including emotional and erotic films. Films were the predominantly used stimuli across these experiments, while most paradigms using painful stimuli were grouped into this MAG ( ). Neurosynth results corroborated these manual annotation interpretations regarding affective, aversive, and social processing, with terms such as \u201c  emotion  ,\u201d \u201c  facial expressions  ,\u201d \u201c  fearful  ,\u201d and \u201c  affective  \u201d ( ). Together, these annotations and a convergent activation pattern involving bilateral amygdalae suggest that MAG 3 was associated with emotional processing ( ). \n\nManual annotations indicated that MAG 4 heavily represented experiments involving navigation through virtual reality environments, with spatial memory demands related to encoding unfamiliar virtual landscapes for future use. A few of these experiments required language processing as well, and half of the experiments that used 3D images were grouped into MAG 5 ( ). The manual annotations were reflected in the Neurosynth results, as similar patterns of activation have been associated with \u201c  navigation  ,\u201d \u201c  scenes  ,\u201d \u201c  memory  ,\u201d and \u201c  place  .\u201d Additional related terms added depth to our characterization, expanding on the memory demands with \u201c  retrieval  ,\u201d \u201c  episodic memory  ,\u201d and \u201c  remembering  \u201d ( ). Overall, these experimental characteristics and convergent activation in medial temporal regions and along the visual processing stream suggest that MAG 5 was associated with navigation and spatial memory ( ). \n\nManual annotations showed that MAG 5 experiments primarily involved either film or music stimuli ( ) and engaged either audiovisual or purely auditory processing ( ). More than half of the included experiments that used music as stimuli were grouped into this MAG ( ), with some stimuli involving an emotional quality ( ). Neurosynth corroborated these interpretations returning terms such as \u201c  auditory  ,\u201d \u201c  sounds  ,\u201d \u201c  listening  ,\u201d and \u201c  speech  \u201d associated with activation of the regions in this MAG. These metadata descriptions combined with convergent activation in superior temporal regions suggest this MAG\u2019s association with auditory processing ( ). \n\nManual annotations of MAG 6 experiments implicated tasks involving visual attentional demands and the processing of visual features, as participants engaged in video games, tactile stimulation, and virtual reality navigation ( ,  ). Stimuli with high visuospatial demands (i.e., video games, virtual reality, and pictures) were represented more by this MAG than any other, whereas stimuli with low visuospatial demands (i.e., music and speech) were represented the least in this MAG. Some experiments involved memory encoding, and visual processing. Neurosynth supported this characterization returning terms including \u201c  visual  ,\u201d \u201c  attention  ,\u201d \u201c  eye movements  ,\u201d \u201c  saccades  ,\u201d and \u201c  spatial attention  \u201d associated with activation of the regions in this MAG ( ). These annotations and convergent activation in regions resembling the dorsal attention network and areas of higher level visual processing (e.g., superior frontal and parietal regions, extrastriate cortex) suggest this MAG\u2019s association with visuospatial attention ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nTo characterize a core set of brain networks engaged in more ecologically valid neuroimaging designs, we employed a data-driven approach that meta-analytically grouped published naturalistic fMRI results according to their spatial topographies. Objective metrics suggested that a solution of   K   = 6 clusters provided the most stable and disparate grouping of experiments across the naturalistic fMRI literature, and ALE meta-analysis delineated convergent activation across spatially distinct brain regions for each meta-analytic grouping (MAG) of experiments. We then considered how such networks subdivide information processing by assessing the characteristics of the constituent experiments from each MAG. Utilizing both manual and automated functional decoding approaches, enhanced interpretations of the mental processes associated with specific constellations of brain regions were gleaned such that the outcomes of the two approaches generally agreed, with differences highlighting domain-specific and domain-general processes associated with naturalistic paradigms. \n\n### Distributed Processing for Complex Functions \n  \nAlthough the six identified MAGs are spatially distinct and appear to correspond with dissociable mental processes, most of the included naturalistic tasks that reported more than one statistical contrast recruited more than one MAG (66 of 86). This is consistent with functional segregation and the flexible nature of the naturalistic design, demonstrating that the manipulation of different contrasts can identify distinct networks that likely cooperate to successfully perform a complex task. Further indicative of coordinated interactions and distributed processing, each MAG included experiments that utilized different task modalities and task types. Overwhelmingly, the identified MAGs and the functional characterizations thereof support the notion that complex behaviors are facilitated by coordinated interactions between several large-scale sensory, attentional, and domain-specific networks, a position increasingly endorsed in neuroimaging endeavors (Barrett & Satpute,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ; Mi\u0161i\u0107 & Sporns,  ; Spreng et al.,  ). The characterization of identified MAGs from aspects of the naturalistic paradigms that elicit them suggest an information processing model of cooperating systems ( ) for sensory input (MAGs 1 and 5), attentional control (MAG 6), and domain-specific processing (MAGs 2, 3, and 4), into and from which information is segregated and integrated to enable complex behaviors (e.g., language, emotion, spatial navigation). Output relevant to the corresponding input would be relegated by motor planning and execution systems, which are notably absent from the characterization of MAGs presented here, as experiments requiring a motor response were evenly distributed across MAGs, rather than clustered together. \n  \nComplex systems for dynamical information processing. The identified MAGs present a framework of component systems that interact to enable complex information processing needed for naturalistic behavior, including necessary input systems, as well as systems for modality-specific (indicated by dashed line) visuospatial attentional gating of irrelevant information and domain-specific processing for language-, emotion-, and navigation-related tasks. \n  \nMAGs 1 and 5 primarily represent the perceptual processing streams of incoming auditory and visual information, and likely cooperate to process audiovisual information. Functional decoding suggests that MAG 1 is involved in viewing faces and anthropomorphic figures, which is consistent with previous research showing that posterior temporal and temporo-occipital regions corresponding with area V5\/MT are associated with the perception of movement, specifically biological movement (Cohen Kadosh et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ,  ; Puce et al.,  ; Wheaton et al.,  ). Similarly, MAG 5 is associated with listening to music and speech, as well as perceiving pitch and tone, stretching across primary auditory cortex and into regions of higher auditory processing (Gray et al.,  ; T\u00fcre et al.,  ). Per functional decoding of MAG 6 of both manual and automated annotations, MAG 6 is associated with visuospatial attention. This functional characterization is also supported by corresponding fronto-parietal activations that are often associated with attending to visual stimuli (Braga et al.,  ; Puschmann et al.,  ). MAGs 1 and 5 represent the perceptual processing streams of audiovisual information. \n\nInformation processing depends on input from perceptual systems, filtered by attentional gating, but proceeds in a functionally segregated manner, seen in domain-specific MAGs for linguistic, emotional, and spatial processing. When considering language processing, there is necessary input to primary auditory areas (MAG 5) that is further processed by higher level language areas that facilitate speech perception and comprehension (MAG 2). More than a third of contrasts from experiments that utilized speech-based paradigms contributed to the convergent activation pattern of MAG 2, which was linked by both functional decoding techniques to language-related processes. Furthermore, the regions of MAG 2 resemble a neural \u201clanguage network\u201d (Friederici & Gierhan,  ; Heim et al.,  ; Price,  ; Saur et al.,  ), including some regions associated with orofacial articulation (lip, tongue, and jaw movements) and motor planning (SMA, pre-SMA) that allow the motor components of speech. By presenting language in a context that is more representative of how we process language in everyday life, such as through the use of spoken fictional narratives (AbdulSabur et al.,  ; Wallentin et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ) or scene descriptions (Summerfield et al.,  ), naturalistic fMRI paradigms allow researchers to explore the multiple neural networks at work in performing the cooperating processes that facilitate language processing. Similarly, emotional processing (MAG 3) often necessitates audiovisual input (MAGs 1 and 5) and necessitates attention (MAG 6). Emotional films recruited regions across these four MAGs, suggesting a similarly diverse group of coordinated neural systems are engaged when observing affective displays. Additionally, navigation (Burgess et al.,  ; Kalpouzos et al.,  ; Wolbers et al.,  ) depends on visual input (MAG 1), effective visuospatial attentional (MAG 6), and spatial memory and processing (MAG 4). The functional characterization of MAG 4 from manual and Neurosynth decoding highlights its involvement in navigation and spatial memory, supported by studies of rats and humans with brain lesions that indicate the importance of medial temporal, hippocampal, and precuneus regions in processing visual scenes and spatial information (Bird & Burgess,  ; Epstein,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Sailer et al.,  ; Squire et al.,  ; Summerfield et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, the characterization of MAG 6 indicates a domain-specific attentional system, as both manual and automated Neurosynth decoding highlight its involvement in visual processing in the absence of any association with other modalities. This is reflected by the distributions of stimuli across MAGs ( ), which show low numbers of auditory and pain-related stimuli represented in MAG 6, while rich visual stimuli that include spatial information (i.e., video games, virtual reality, and pictures) are highly represented across the experiments in MAG 6. Curiously, tactile object manipulation was highly represented in MAG 6, representing the perception of spatial information in the absence of visual information ( ,  ). Together, these suggest that MAG 6 provides modality-specific attentional gating, depicted by the dashed line in  . \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present results may be limited by the   k  -means clustering method, which is limited by the assumptions of the algorithm and underlying topology of the data, as it is sensitive to spherical clusters and assumes the data are linearly separable. Furthermore, there is a potential for bias with this method; certain parameters are specified by the researcher beforehand. To address this potential for bias and the stability of our clustering solution, we performed duplicate clustering analyses with both linear (hierarchical clustering using Ward\u2019s method) and nonlinear (kernel   k  -means and density-based spatial clustering) methods. The results of these analyses are provided in the Supporting information (Figures S1\u2013S3, Bottenhorn et al.,  ) and confirmed that our choice of the   k  -means clustering method provided optimal separation of the data into six clusters. Experiments in our corpus were grouped using the   kmeans++   algorithm for each of   K   = 2 through   K   = 20 solutions, repeated 1,000 times to ensure that each solution minimized the point-to-centroid distance, indicative of optimal clustering (Kanungo et al.,  ). Pearson\u2019s correlation was selected as the distance metric, as recommended by Laird et al. ( ). The   K   = 6 solution was designated as an optimal candidate solution before assessing the convergent activation patterns of each MAG, based on the aforementioned metrics, yielding a data-driven result. These results are, of course, influenced by the choice of clustering method, and should be considered accordingly. As this was a meta-analytic effort, it is limited, too, by the initial modeling of the data. Despite this, coordinate-based meta-analyses are considered a robust method for synthesis of previously published functional neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Fox et al.,  ). Although the functional decoding-based manual annotations relied on a subjective process, the results were largely confirmed by comparison with the wider body of functional neuroimaging literature facilitated by Neurosynth\u2019s automated functional decoding. It is worth noting that the naturalistic literature is somewhat limited, with an emphasis on navigation and affective processing, and continued research and expansion of this corpus will facilitate development of a more comprehensive model of the neural networks that support realistic behavior. \n\n\n### Summary and Future Work \n  \nIn summary, this meta-analysis of naturalistic fMRI studies that apply dynamic, lifelike tasks to explore the neural correlates of behavior has shown that these paradigms engage a set of core neural networks, supporting both separate processing of different streams of information and the integration of related information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior. We identified seven patterns of consistent activation that correspond with neural networks that are involved in sensory input, top-down attentional control, domain-specific processing, and motor planning, representing the set of behavioral processes elicited by naturalistic paradigms in our corpus. Across the corpus, tasks provided mainly visual and auditory sensory input that engaged regions across MAGs 1 and 5, while MAG 6 appeared to contribute to top-down attentional control to filter out nonessential visual and\/or spatial information. Salient information can be processed by the relevant domain-specific networks, shown in MAGs 2 (language), 3 (emotion), and 4 (navigation and spatial memory), informing the appropriate response. Most naturalistic tasks engaged multiple networks to process the relevant information from a stimulus and generate an appropriate response. A shift in favor of utilizing naturalistic paradigms, when possible, would greatly benefit the field, as naturalistic stimuli more closely approximate the full complement of processing necessary for realistic behavior. Because of the availability of naturalistic fMRI data from sources such as studyforrest.org, the Human Connectome Project, and the Healthy Brain Network Serial Scanning Initiative (HBNSSI), an intriguing next step in this line of work would include validating these MAGs in the primary analysis of imaging data. Exploring how multifaceted processes interact and, ultimately, contribute to behavior will allow us to better understand the brain and human behavior in the real world. In the future, studies of this sort would greatly benefit from an automated annotation process for an objective functional decoding of included papers, instead of subjective manual annotation. \n\n\n\n## SUPPORTING INFORMATION \n  \nThe authors have released all code and data associated with this manuscript.

Previous studies proposed that RS in posterior regions is associated with priming of perceptual processes, whereas RS in more anterior (prefrontal) regions is associated with priming of conceptual processes. To clarify which regions exhibit reliable RS associated with perceptual and conceptual priming, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis using coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation. This analysis included 65 fMRI studies that (i) employed visual repetition priming during either perceptual or conceptual tasks, (ii) demonstrated behavioral priming, and (iii) reported the results from whole-brain analyses. Our results showed that repetition priming was mainly associated with RS in left inferior frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. Importantly, RS in these regions was found for both perceptual and conceptual tasks, and no regions show RS that was selective to one of these tasks. These results question the simple distinction between conceptual and perceptual priming, and suggest consideration of other factors such as stimulus-response bindings. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPriming refers to behavioral changes in the identification, production, or classification of a stimulus caused by a previous encounter with the same or a similar stimulus (Tulving and Schacter,  ). Priming has been associated with implicit, or unconscious, memory, because it is normally unaffected by brain lesions that cause impairments of conscious or explicit memory, i.e., amnesia (Gabrieli et al.,  ; Keane et al.,  ), and because it is measured by tasks that do not require explicit memory for the previous encounter. Over the last few decades, the neural bases of priming have been studied extensively with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Specifically, fMRI studies found that repeated processing of a primed stimulus is associated with decreased responses in various brain regions. This phenomenon is called repetition suppression (RS; for review, see Grill-Spector et al.,  ). RS has therefore been proposed as a neural signature of behavioral priming (e.g., Schacter and Buckner,  ; Wiggs and Martin,  ; Henson,  ; Gotts et al.,  ), though in fact direct correlations between the size of RS and the amount of behavioral priming are rarely reported (Schacter et al.,  ), and when they are found, such behavioral correlations are mainly with RS in frontal brain regions (e.g., Dobbins et al.,  ; Maccotta and Buckner,  ; Horner and Henson,  ). \n\nKim ( ) performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to clarify which brain regions exhibit reliable RS. A meta-analytic approach is important to account for different statistical thresholds across studies, and potentially to generalize over differences in stimuli and task. Kim collected 1,020 coordinates of peak foci from 106 experiments and 1,454 participants. The results showed consistent RS in bilateral inferior frontal cortex and ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Kim ( ) suggested that RS in ventral occipitotemporal cortex reflects facilitated perceptual processing (since all the experiments used visual stimuli), while RS in inferior frontal cortex reflects some combination of facilitated conceptual processing, automatized stimulus-response mapping, less demand for top-down enhancement, and reductions in novelty. Additionally, Kim found that most regions showing RS for one type of visual stimulus also showed RS for other types. For example, direct comparisons between words, non-words, scenes, faces, and objects indicated that ventral occipitotemporal cortex shows RS regardless of type of visual stimulus. \n\nIn addition to RS, repeated stimulus presentation can result in enhanced brain responses relative to its first presentation, or \u201crepetition enhancement\u201d (RE). While RE is most often reported in brain regions associated with explicit memory, most likely reflecting incidental conscious memory for the previous encounter with a stimulus (even though that encounter is irrelevant to performance of priming tasks), it has occasionally been reported in brain regions associated with priming, and which show RS under other conditions (see Schacter et al.,  ; Dolan et al.,  ; George et al.,  ; Henson et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, Kim's ( ) meta-analysis searched for the terms \u201crepetition suppression\u201d and \u201cneural priming\u201d to identify initial candidate articles, many of which may not have reported concurrent behavioral priming. As far as we are aware, the only meta-analyses of behavioral priming and its neural correlates have focused on specific priming paradigms, such as negative priming (e.g., a slowing rather than speeding of responses to repeated stimuli; Yaple and Arsalidou,  ), semantic priming (e.g., speeded responding to a target preceded by a semantically related prime; Rodd et al.,  ) and processing of subliminal stimuli (Brooks et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). Therefore, the first goal of the present study was to restrict the meta-analysis to studies that reported significant behavioral priming (in implicit memory tasks), but expand this across a range of different repetition priming paradigms (such as speeded classification, item identification, and word-stem completion, but excluding negative priming, semantic priming, and masked\/subliminal priming), and to allow for RE as well as RS. Like Kim, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) to determine the convergence of statistical peaks showing RS and RE. \n\nFurthermore, we distinguished two different types of repetition priming (Schacter and Buckner,  ): perceptual priming and conceptual priming. Perceptual processing relies on the physical characteristics of the stimuli, or \u201cdata-driven\u201d processes, whereas conceptual priming relies on the meaning of the stimuli, or \u201cconceptually-driven\u201d processes (Jacoby,  ; Blaxton,  ). Since we examined only repetition priming but not semantic, relatedness or associative priming in this meta-analysis, perceptual priming denotes \u201crepetition priming in perceptual tasks\u201d and conceptual priming denotes \u201crepetition priming in conceptual tasks.\u201d Examples of commonly-used perceptual priming tasks include perceptual identification (naming words or objects as quickly as possible) and word-stem\/fragment completion (producing the first word that comes to mind in response to a cue representing part of that word); examples of conceptual priming tasks include category generation\/association (generating several exemplars of a cued category) and conceptual classification (e.g., deciding as quickly as possible whether an object is living or non-living). Numerous psychological studies have reported behavioral dissociations between these two types of priming (e.g., in terms of their sensitivity to other psychological factors; see Roediger and McDermott,   for review). \n\nEarly neuropsychological support for a neural dissociation between perceptual vs. conceptual priming arose in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While AD can damage many areas of the brain, particularly as the disease progresses, the damage is normally greatest in medial temporal lobe structures, and is least in early sensory regions. Consistent with this, AD patients generally show intact perceptual priming (Buckner et al.,  ; Fleischman et al.,  ; Gabrieli et al.,  ; Keane et al.,  ) despite defective conceptual priming (Salmon et al.,  ; Monti et al.,  ; Gabrieli et al.,  ). However, the preservation of conceptual priming in AD has been reported in some studies (Grosse et al.,  ; Meiran and Jelicic,  ; Fleischman and Gabrieli,  ). These discrepancies might reflect differences in task characteristics, or owe to the highly variable and diffuse extent of pathology in AD, which also depends on the stage of the progressive neurodegenerative disease (Fleischman et al.,  ; Fleischman,  ). Other studies have examined patients with more focal, acquired lesions. For example, Gong et al. ( ) used a picture identification task (i.e., perceptual priming) and a category exemplar generation task (i.e., conceptual priming) to study patients with occipital vs. frontal lobe lesions. They found that the performance of perceptual priming was poorer in occipital lesion group, whereas the performance of conceptual priming was poorer in frontal lesion group. Thus, these neuropsychological studies support a double dissociation, with occipital cortex supporting perceptual priming and frontal cortex supporting conceptual priming. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided some further support for the claim that perceptual and conceptual priming are associated with different brain regions (Schacter and Buckner,  ; Schacter et al.,  ). As might be expected from the component process view (Schacter and Buckner,  ; Henson,  ), according to which RS reflects facilitation of specific processes involved in a given task, perceptual priming tends to produce RS in more sensory-related regions, such as occipitotemporal gyrus for visual stimuli, while conceptual priming tends to produce RS in frontotemporal regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus and inferior temporal cortex). Moreover, some studies have found correlations between the size of the behavioral priming effect in conceptual priming tasks and the amount of RS in inferior frontal gyrus (Lustig and Buckner,  ; Maccotta and Buckner,  ; Bunzeck et al.,  ; Turk-Browne et al.,  ; Soldan et al.,  ) or fusiform gyrus (Turk-Browne et al.,  ; Soldan et al.,  ), though such correlations are not always reported. Interestingly, these correlations are normally found with RS in inferior frontal gyrus and conceptual priming, as measured by reduced RTs in semantic classification tasks; we are not aware of any study that has found a correlation between RS in occipitotemporal areas and measures of perceptual priming, e.g., reduced RTs in perceptual priming tasks. \n\nAn alternative to the component process view of RS is the hypothesis that RS reflects retrieval of stimulus-response (S-R) bindings (for review, see Henson et al.,  ). According to this view, the response made on the initial stimulus is bound to that stimulus, such that when the stimulus is repeated, the response can be generated without repeating the perceptual and conceptual component processes that were initially engaged to produce that response, resulting in reduced activity in relevant regions. On the contrary, if S-R bindings are no longer relevant, those brain regions are equal active for repeated and initial processing, causing an absence of RS. The first neuroimaging evidence for this possibility came from Dobbins et al. ( ), who showed that simply reversing the task in a semantic classification paradigm abolished RS in fusiform and frontal cortex. Their argument was that responding to the first presentation of a stimulus creates a unique S-R binding, such that when that stimulus is primed, the S-R binding can be retrieved and used to generate the response, bypassing the need for repeated perceptual or conceptual processing. Subsequent studies (e.g., Horner and Henson,  ,  ; Race et al.,  ) showed that task reversal (or other ways to reduce the influence of S-R bindings) does not always abolish RS in occipitotemporal regions, though it invariably does so in frontal regions (and indeed, sometimes reversing the S-R contingency can produce RE rather than RS in frontal regions; Horner and Henson,  ). While the contributions of S-R bindings do not rule out a role for occipiotemporal cortex in perceptual priming or inferior frontal cortex in conceptual priming, they do confound many behavioral measures of priming (particularly those using speeded classification tasks; Horner and Henson,  ), and it is possible that the correlations found between RS in inferior frontal gyrus and priming in conceptual priming tasks actually reflects retrieval of S-R bindings, i.e., does not reflect facilitated conceptual processing. Thus, the second goal of our meta-analysis was to see whether the brain regions showing RS differed according to perceptual vs. conceptual priming, or if not, to consider whether a common pattern of results could owe to S-R bindings. \n\nOur final goal relates to the nature of the stimuli used. Many studies assume they are measuring conceptual priming because they use a task that requires conceptual processing, even though the stimuli are also repeated in the same perceptual format, and therefore the neural and\/or behavioral consequences of priming can include additional perceptual processes. To isolate \u201cpurer\u201d conceptual priming, some studies have examined priming and RS across a change in the perceptual format (e.g., from pictures to words, e.g., Simons et al.,  ). Therefore, we performed a sub-analysis of conceptual priming studies in which different exemplars of stimuli were used for primed vs. unprimed conditions (even though the same \u201cconcept\u201d was repeated). \n\nIn sum, the three objectives of this meta-analysis are (1) to identify the brain regions with the most consistent RS and RE across fMRI studies that show concurrent behavioral priming, (2) to test whether different brain regions show RS for perceptual vs. conceptual priming, and (3) to further examine the RS associated with conceptual priming across stimuli with minimal perceptual overlap. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThis study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). \n\n### Literature Search and Selection Criteria \n  \nA literature search for human fMRI studies on behavioral priming up to October 31, 2018 was initiated via the PubMed ( ) search engine. The search under \u201c(perceptual priming OR conceptual priming OR repetition priming) AND (fMRI OR functional MRI)\u201d produced a total of 308 relevant studies. The following criteria were used on the selection of these articles for evaluation and analysis ( ): \n  \nOnly studies conducting fMRI on healthy participants were selected. \n  \nOnly studies using implicit, priming tasks, such as perceptual identification, naming, and conceptual judgment (e.g., semantic categorization) were selected. Those using passive viewing, motor learning, and explicit memory tasks were excluded. Negative priming, semantic priming, and masked\/subliminal priming were not the focus of this meta-analysis, so studies using them were also excluded. \n  \nOnly studies showing significant behavioral priming were selected. Priming was assessed by a decrease in reaction time, an increase in accuracy, or a bias in response to primed stimulus. When the behavioral results are collected with a separate group of participants different from those in the fMRI experiments, only studies using the same design in both behavioral and fMRI experiments were included. \n  \nOnly studies using visual stimuli were included, such as words or pictures, since visual stimulation has been the dominant modality in fMRI studies. Note that some studies primed the same \u201citem,\u201d but in a different visual format the first vs. second time (e.g., the word \u201capple\u201d followed by a picture of an apple). \n  \nTo be compatible with ALE approach, only studies showing peak coordinate foci in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space for a whole-brain analysis were included. Those involving region of interest (ROI) analyses were excluded. We only included whole-brain analyses in order to increase the number of the foci and thus the power of each individual meta-analysis. \n    \nPRISMA flow chart for procedure of study selection. \n  \nThe above criteria resulted in the selection of 51 studies. Through reviewing the reference lists of the collected papers, additional 14 relevant studies that passed the selection criteria were collected, producing 65 in total. \n\nContrasts (i.e., experiments) from these studies were extracted for analysis. The contrasts used for identifying RS were New > Old, Novel > Repeated, or First presentation > Second presentation; contrasts for RE were the opposite, i.e., New < Old, Novel < Repeated, or First presentation < Second presentation. To minimize the possibility that meta-analytic results are driven by within-experiment and within-group effects (Turkeltaub et al.,  ), at most one RS contrast and one RE contrast from one experiment within each study was selected. This resulted in 27 studies reporting both RS and RE, 38 studies reporting RS only, and none of them reporting only RE. \n\nSome of these studies demonstrated RS and\/or RE in more than one contrast. For instance, the experiment of (Bunzeck et al.,  ) involved two stimulus categories, faces and scenes. Behavioral priming, as well as RS and RE were observed in both categories. Under this circumstance, we collected only the contrasts that involved all stimulus types (e.g., new faces and scenes > old faces and scenes for RS, and old faces and scenes > new faces and scenes for RE). If the studies did not report the results from the contrast All novel > All repeated for RS, or All novel < All repeated for RE, we chose the contrasts from the most typical stimulus type (e.g., neutral faces instead of emotional faces; words instead of pseudowords). However, eight studies included two contrasts for RS and\/or RE because the contrasts were from different groups of participants (e.g., young and old; Daselaar et al.,  ; Bergerbest et al.,  ; Ballesteros et al.,  ), different tasks (Schott et al.,  ; Zago et al.,  ), or different types of stimuli (e.g., objects and words; Chouinard and Goodale,  ; Heusser et al.,  ). Overall, the 65 studies provided data for 100 experiments. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nFive sets of meta-analyses were performed. The first meta-analysis analyzed all of the priming experiments reporting RS (  n   = 72). Second, the experiments showing RE were analyzed (  n   = 28). \n\nFor the third analysis, every experiment was classified as perceptual priming task or conceptual priming task based on the type of task used. Perceptual priming tasks were defined as those involved data-driven processes such as word-stem completion, lexical decision, naming, and perceptual identification (  n   = 27). Conceptual priming tasks were defined as those involved conceptually driven processes including category generation and the conceptual judgment (  n   = 45).   lists the number and tasks of perceptual and conceptual priming experiments; the supplementary material available online provides a more detailed description of all of the studies and experiments in the meta-analysis. \n  \nNumber of experiments and included tasks in perceptual and conceptual priming. \n  \nFor comparison of conceptual and perceptual priming, we performed both a conjunction analysis (looking for commonalities) and a subtraction analysis (looking for differences in RS between conceptual vs. perceptual priming). \n\nA fourth meta-analysis investigated conceptual priming without perceptual overlap, that is, the stimuli were primed by different object exemplars, views, or segments (  n   = 5). Finally, since picture naming has been proposed to involve both perceptual and conceptual processing (see Discussion), in a fifth analysis, we repeated the conjunction and subtraction analyses but after removing the 6 studies that used picture naming. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Techniques \n  \nThe software GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ) was used to conduct the ALE meta-analyses and the conversion of coordinates reported in MNI space into Talairach space. The ALE meta-analysis is a coordinate-based method capable of determining the brain regions showing an above-chance level of activation convergence across a set of independent studies. In the ALE approach, the foci extracted from the selected studies are not treated as single points, but rather are modeled as the centers of three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution taking into account spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variance (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The width of probability distributions (i.e., full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) is determined by the number of subjects in each experiment. The probabilities of all activation foci in a certain experiment were then combined for each voxel by taking the union, yielding a modeled activation map (MA map). Voxel-wise ALE scores resulted from the union across the MA maps among the experiments that represented the likelihood of activation convergent at particular locations. \n\nTo enable spatial inference on these ALE scores, a   p  -value was calculated for each voxel based on the probability of observing an ALE value higher than the value under the null-distribution. This is achieved by randomly relocating ALE values throughout the brain, that is, via random permutation. In this study, the   p  -values were generated by 10,000 permutations. Followed by guidelines recommended by the developers of this method (Eickhoff et al.,  ), the statistical maps were finally thresholded at family-wise error (FWE) corrected   p   < 0.05 with an initial cluster-forming threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.001 to enforce a minimum cluster size. The threshold of contrast analysis was set at   p   < 0.05, FDR corrected, with permutations = 10,000 and minimum volume = 0 mm . GingerALE employs the term \u201ccontributing studies,\u201d to describe studies that are located within the boundaries of ALE cluster. However, it is possible that other studies located near these boundaries but outside of the cluster could have also contributed to it. \n\nThe thresholded ALE result images were visualized using the Mango 4.0.1 (San Antonio, TX: UT Health Science Center Research Imaging Institute) and overlaid onto a Talairach-based anatomical template ( ). Local maxima of activation clusters were anatomically labeled with visual reference to an anatomical atlas provided by Mango. The clusters in the result tables were ordered by region, from frontal, parietal, to occipitotemporal region. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Repetition Suppression in All Priming Tasks \n  \nResults of the meta-analysis on the occurrences of repetition suppression (RS) from all priming experiments (  n   = 72) are shown in  ,  . These experiments contained 751 activation foci from 1,128 participants. RS was mainly associated with the bilateral fusiform gyrus (FG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and middle occipital gyrus. More specifically, the significant clusters were centered within the bilateral FG, left IFG, right cingulate gyrus, right precentral gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, and left precuneus. \n  \nBrain regions showing RS or RE across all priming contrasts. \n    \nBrain regions showing the occurrences of RS (red) and RE (green) from an ALE meta-analysis of all priming experiments. \n  \n\n### Repetition Enhancement in All Priming Tasks \n  \nThe meta-analysis of 28 experiments reporting repetition enhancement (RE) contained 158 activation foci from 421 participants. The results showed the significant clusters located in the bilateral precuneus and left middle frontal gyrus ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Repetition Suppression in Perceptual and Conceptual Priming Tasks \n  \nFrom 263 foci and 422 subjects in 27 perceptual priming experiments, the ALE analysis revealed three significant clusters including the left FG, left middle frontal gyrus and left insula ( ,  ). The ALE analysis of 488 foci and 706 subjects in 45 conceptual priming experiments revealed 9 clusters in the bilateral FG, bilateral IFG, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus ( ). \n  \nBrain regions showing RS in perceptual and conceptual priming separately. \n    \nBrain regions showing the occurrences of repetition suppression from an ALE meta-analysis of the conceptual (red) and perceptual (green) priming experiments. \n  \nCommon regions showing RS for both perceptual and conceptual priming were calculated using a conjunction analysis ( ). The overlapping regions were left FG and left IFG. The differences between RS during perceptual and conceptual priming were analyzed by performing subtraction analysis across their thresholded ALE maps. A direct contrast between the two types of priming showed no significant cluster. \n  \nResults of conjunction analysis. Brain regions showing RS for both conceptual and perceptual priming. \n  \n\n### Repetition Suppression in Conceptual Priming Tasks Without Perceptual Overlap \n  \nTo address whether RS in the fusiform and occipital gyri during conceptual priming tasks is caused by repetition of the same stimulus, in a separate analysis we included only experiments in which primed stimuli were perceptually different from unprimed stimuli (i.e., different exemplars, views, and segments) (  n   = 5). The results of the meta-analysis still showed consistent RS in one area, the left FG. \n\n\n### Repetition Suppression in Perceptual Priming Tasks Without Picture Naming \n  \nSix studies using picture naming task were excluded from perceptual priming because it has been proposed that naming involves conceptual processing as well (see Discussion). The remaining 21 perceptual priming experiments contained 218 activation foci from 347 participants. Only one region, the left FG, was now revealed by the conjunction analysis (i.e., the IFG was no longer present), though still no region showed an interaction between RS and perceptual\/conceptual priming in the subtraction analysis. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study performed meta-analyses across 65 studies that used fMRI to study the neural correlates of behavioral repetition priming. When including all studies, repetition suppression (RS) was consistently observed in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and fusiform gyrus (FG); whereas repetition enhancement (RE) was consistently shown in bilateral precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Interestingly, a conjunction analysis showed that RS occurred in left IFG and left FG during both perceptual and conceptual priming tasks, and a subtraction analysis provided no evidence for any region implicated in one task but not the other. In other words, there was little evidence for a qualitative dissociation between the neural correlates of perceptual and conceptual priming. \n\n### RS in Fusiform Gyrus and Inferior Frontal Gyrus \n  \nThe prevalence of RS in FG and IFG is consistent with the previous meta-analyses on RS (Kim,  ,  ), which included many of the same studies, but did not restrict analysis to those studies that showed concurrent behavioral priming. However, our results did not show RS in hippocampus, which is believed to reflect priming of relational processing of information (Kim,  ), most likely because most of the studies here used single-item priming. Given the debate about whether hippocampus is only involved in explicit memory, or can also be involved in implicit relational memory (e.g., Henke,  ), more neuroimaging studies are needed on implicit relational priming. \n\nPrevious neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies on priming have suggested that the occipitotemporal and frontal regions are the critical areas for mediating perceptual and conceptual priming, respectively (Wiggs and Martin,  ; Schacter et al.,  ; Gong et al.,  ). The component process view proposes that RS reflects the facilitation of processes that are engaged during both initial and primed presentation of a stimulus, and therefore occurs in brain regions specialized for those processes (Schacter and Buckner,  ; Henson,  ). For instance, RS in occipitotemporal regions (such as fusiform cortex) is thought to reflect the facilitation of visual perceptual processes (Blaxton,  ; Henson,  ), whereas RS in prefrontal regions (such as inferior frontal gyrus) is thought to reflect the facilitation of conceptual processes (Wagner et al.,  ,  ). However, our meta-analysis provided less support for this putative division of labor, since we found that FG showed RS for both perceptual and conceptual priming, and IFG showed RS for conceptual and\/or perceptual priming. \n\nPrima facie, this is inconsistent with the component process view. However, it is possible that the studies we assigned to examples of perceptual vs. conceptual priming were not \u201cprocess pure,\u201d in the sense that both perceptual and conceptual processes might have been facilitated, even if the stimuli and task were designed to emphasize one type of process over the other. This ambiguity might have led to the wrong contrasts\/studies being assigned to the wrong category of conceptual vs. perceptual in this meta-analysis, and might even explain why a clear dissociation was not found between these two types of priming. An example of this would be in studies of conceptual priming that use a semantic task (assumed to engage conceptual processes) but also repeat the stimulus in the same format (e.g., words), which is likely to result in concurrent facilitation of perceptual processes too. However, when we performed a subsidiary analysis of just those studies that changed the (visual) format of the initial and primed presentation of an item, there was still evidence of RS in FG (though it is worth noting that the number for this analysis of \u201cpure\u201d conceptual priming is below the number of 17\u201320 experiments suggested by Eickhoff et al.,  ). While it is possible that FG is involved in conceptual processes as well as IFG, this finding questions the neuroimaging support for the neural dissociation between conceptual and perceptual priming (e.g., from neuropsychological data). \n\nWe also found RS in IFG for perceptual priming, which is discussed even less in the literature, and not easy to explain by the component process view. However, another debate concerns studies using picture naming. Picture naming was included as an example of perceptual processing in early studies (Wiggs and Martin,  ). Subsequent research however, particularly using bilingual participants, suggests that picture naming can be decomposed into object identification and word production: object identification is assumed to be a perceptual process, whereas word production requires conceptual access (Francis and S\u00e1enz,  ; Francis et al.,  ; for review, see Francis,  ). Factor analysis has also suggested that picture naming taps both perceptual and conceptual factors (Bruss and Mitchell,  ). We therefore performed a further sub-analysis after having removed studies using picture naming. While there was still no region showing a significant difference in RS between perceptual and conceptual priming in the subtraction analysis, the conjunction analysis now revealed a common RS only in FG. Thus, we cannot make strong conclusions about the role of IFG in perceptual priming, if naming tasks are excluded as an example of perceptual priming: it could be that IFG is only involved in conceptual priming, or the lack of IFG in our sub-analysis could be a false negative owing to the reduced sample size. Further studies are needed to resolve this question, and dissociate the perceptual vs. conceptual contributions to naming. \n\nAn alternative interpretation of our findings is that RS in IFG and FG reflects the retrieval of S-R bindings, cued by the repetition of a stimulus, where this rapid and direct retrieval of a response bypasses the need for \u201cre-running\u201d the component processes involved on first presentation of the stimulus, leading to RS (Dobbins et al.,  ; for review, see Henson et al.,  ). There is compelling evidence that S-R bindings make a major contribution to behavioral priming in the speeded classification tasks that were used in the majority of priming tasks considered here, and such bindings can include multiple, abstract representations of stimuli, and responses, which would allow them to generalize across visual format for example (e.g., Horner and Henson,  ,  ). It seems likely that IFG in particular is involved in control processes like response generation, and therefore prone to showing the facilitatory effect of retrieving a response directly from an S-R binding in either perceptual or conceptual priming. This might explain why the most common region to show correlations between RS and behavioral priming in previous studies is IFG. The role of FG in retrieving S-R bindings is less clear, particularly when residual RS in FG has been found despite minimizing the contribution of S-R bindings (Horner and Henson,  ; Race et al.,  ), and when there have been few reports that FG RS correlates with behavioral priming. It is possible that facilitation of perceptual processes (according to component process view) does occur in FG, but this explains only a minor proportion of the variance in behavioral priming (compared that attributed to decision processes in IFG). This hybrid account (perceptual facilitation in FG and S-R retrieval in IFG) is supported by ERP studies that suggest that repetition effects in FG are time-locked to stimulus onset, while repetition effects in IFG are time-locked to response onset (Race et al.,  ; Horner and Henson,  ; Wig,  ). \n\nOne way to distinguish the component process account from the S-R binding account is to manipulate the task (response requirements) so that S-R bindings become unhelpful, potentially revealing only the underlying component processes (see Henson et al.,  ). Indeed, when reversing the task between initial and primed presentations, such that the responses retrieved from S-R bindings conflict with those generated by component processes, IFG can even show RE rather than RS (Horner and Henson,  ), suggesting that the S-R binding account explains the IFG findings better than the component process account. Unfortunately there were insufficient numbers of studies for the current meta-analysis to compare tasks where the same response was repeated (congruent) vs. altered or reversed (incongruent), which would help interpret the role of RS in the two key areas of IFG and FG identified here. Another potential approach is to use techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to directly modulate the processing in certain brain regions. For example, Wig et al. ( ) applied TMS to IFG and found that both RS in this region, and behavioral priming, were reduced in a visual object semantic classification task. While this could be explained by disruption of conceptual processing or retrieval of S-R bindings, it is interesting that RS in a posterior visual region (middle occipital gyrus, though not FG) was not affected by the TMS to IFG, despite the reduction in behavioral priming. This is consistent with the above hybrid account, where RS in those regions is related to perceptual facilitation, but this facilitation makes negligible contribution to behavioral priming (relative to conceptual facilitation) in semantic tasks like this. Further evidence to distinguish these possibilities requires TMS to perceptual regions like FG. \n\n\n### RS in Other Regions \n  \nLike Wig et al. ( ), we did find RS in middle occipital gyrus when considering all priming experiments, but not in conceptual priming tasks without perceptual overlap, suggesting that this region is involved in relatively low-level visual processing. Our results also showed RS in precentral gyrus in all experiments. This could be related to priming of motor responses, but we think this is unlikely, because in most studies reviewed, the specific motor response was orthogonal to the contrast of primed vs. unprimed trials (e.g., left and right index fingers were pressed equally often for both primed and unprimed trials) and few studies involved immediate repetition of the same stimulus and response. \n\n\n### RE in Precuneus and Middle Frontal Gyrus \n  \nOnly two regions showed RE in the current priming tasks: precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Precuneus is a region that often shows activation for primed vs. initial stimuli in explicit memory tasks, and has been associated with recollection and visual imagery in particular. It seems likely that the RE found in the present implicit tasks reflects incidental (possibly involuntary) recollection of the initial presentation of a stimulus, even though such recollection is not needed to perform the priming task (Donaldson et al.,  ; Henson et al.,  ; Kim and Yassa,  ; Gomes et al.,  ; Poppenk et al.,  ; see also Kim,  ). An alternative explanation is that precuneus responds more to easier tasks, e.g., more to primed than novel objects (Korsnes et al.,  ; Korsnes and Magnussen,  ). It is also possible that regions showing RE, such as precuneus, are \u201ctask-negative\u201d regions. Such task-negative regions might receive less suppressive input from other \u201ctask-positive\u201d regions, leading to RE. The role of RE in middle frontal gyrus is less clear: it could also reflect incidental explicit memory, though this region is often associated more with monitoring the products of explicit memory (Henson et al.,  ) and a typical implicit task would not seem require such post-retrieval monitoring, unless it reflects decision processes related to the use of S-R bindings vs. component processes (see above). \n\nInterestingly, none of the regions typically associated with priming (e.g., from neuropsychology) showed evidence of RE (rather than RS). This may be because the majority of studies in the present meta-analysis used pre-experimentally familiar rather than unfamiliar stimuli (see Henson et al.,  ; Segaert et al.,  ; Makukhin and Bolland,  ). Another possibility is that distinct populations of neurons exhibit suppressed vs. enhanced responses to primed stimuli (de Gardelle et al.,  ), so that the overall response of a brain region (or voxel) depends on the ratio of these neuronal populations. Further studies are needed to investigate when priming is associated with RE vs. RS, but what is clear is that the association of RS with implicit memory and RE with explicit memory is likely to be too simplistic (e.g., Henson,  ). \n\n\n### Limitation and Future Directions \n  \nThe present study possesses inherent limitations of the meta-analysis approach. First is the most important issue about which experiments or contrasts are included in the meta-analysis. For example, we included studies in which stimuli repeat either with or without intervening trials. However, the neural mechanism of immediate priming (or fMRI adaptation; Grill-Spector and Malach,  ) may differ from priming over longer delays (e.g., Epstein et al.,  ). Other factors that might affect the distribution and direction of repetition effects include attention (Eger,  ; Yi,  ), familiarity (Henson et al.,  ; Korsnes et al.,  ; Soldan et al.,  ,  ) and number of repetitions (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). We included all these studies in order to increase the sensitivity of our meta-analysis to the regions generally associated with priming. A second limitation is that, while our conjunction analyses provided positive evidence for shared RS in IFG and FG for conceptual and perceptual priming, the lack of other regions showing a significant difference in RS for conceptual and perceptual priming is a null result that cannot be used to argue that there are no differences. A third limitation is that ALE calculations do not consider the size of an effect (only where it is significant). Thus if conceptual and perceptual priming both produced significant RS in the IFG and FG, but to differing degrees (e.g., greater RS in IFG for conceptual than perceptual priming, and greater RS in FG for perceptual than conceptual priming), then this would not be apparent in the current type of meta-analysis. \n\nOur results also suggest some possible directions for future studies. Firstly, Schacter et al. ( ) stated that there is scant evidence of correlation between RS in posterior regions and behavioral priming effects. Indeed, there has not been strong evidence on the correlation of behavioral perceptual priming and RS in brain regions such as occipital and temporal lobe. One possibility is that the type of correlation analysis is not appropriate: Previous studies measured Pearson's correlation between the magnitude of priming and RS across subjects. However, the measurements of correlations across trials within subject may provide greater sensitivity and avoid other sources of inter-subject variability. \n\nA second important issue is how IFG communicates with occipitotemporal gyrus. Some theoretical models such as synchronization (Gotts et al.,  ) and predictive coding (Grotheer and Kov\u00e1cs,  ) emphasize the interaction between different regions. If so, changes in between-region functional and effective connectivity should be identified, in addition to changes in regional activity. For instance, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) suggested that repetition of body images is associated with changes in backward (fusiform body area, FBA, to extrastriate body area, EBA), as well as forward, (EBA-to-FBA), connections (Ewbank et al.,  ). \n\nFinally, it is surprising that we did not find brain correlates of conceptual priming in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) or in perirhinal cortex, which are both regions that previous lesion and imaging studies have implicated in semantic processing (Wright et al.,  ; Ralph et al.,  ). One reason might be the fMRI signal loss in these regions when using conventional gradient-echo fMRI acquisition, and future studies could employ methods to minimize this signal loss. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present meta-analyses identify RS in fusiform gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, and RE in precuneus and middle frontal gyrus, during behavioral priming tasks. The overlap in regions exhibiting RS across perceptual and conceptual priming is not predicted by previous studies and reviews, nor expected based on human lesion data. One alternative to the component process view is that the inferior frontal RS reflects the retrieval of S-R bindings, and the fusiform RS reflects the facilitated perceptual\/conceptual processing of the stimuli. Thus, future studies should attempt to examine how S-R bindings and component processes interact to determine the magnitude of RS and priming. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets presented in this study are included in the article\/ . \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nS-ML performed the analysis and drafted the manuscript.

However, prosocial decisions vary widely as a function of other task features. The diverse ways that prosociality is defined and the heterogeneity of prosocial decisions have created challenges for interpreting findings across studies and identifying their neural correlates. To overcome these challenges, we aimed to organize the prosocial decision-making task space of neuroimaging studies. We conducted a systematic search for studies in which participants made decisions to increase the welfare of others during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We identified shared and distinct features of these tasks and employed an unsupervised graph-based approach to assess how various forms of prosocial decision-making are related in terms of their low-level components (e.g. task features like potential cost to the agent or potential for reciprocity). Analyses uncovered three clusters of prosocial decisions, which we labeled as cooperation, equity and altruism. This feature-based representation of the task structure was supported by results of a neuroimaging meta-analysis that each type of prosocial decisions recruited diverging neural systems. Results clarify some of the existing heterogeneity in how prosociality is conceptualized and generate insight for future research and task paradigm development. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nProsocial decisions\u2014choices that increase the welfare of others\u2014are universal across cultures ( ) and are integral for supporting interpersonal relationships at multiple scales, including between dyads ( ;  ), among groups and social networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and within societies ( ). And, while largely conserved across species ( ;  ;  ), the prevalence and variety of prosociality exhibited by humans is unique ( ;  ). Although cognitive and neural processes underlying various forms of prosociality have been studied extensively across disciplines spanning psychology, neuroscience, economics and biology, the heterogeneity of prosocial decisions has led to inconsistencies in how they are operationalized and categorized ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This can create challenges when interpreting findings across neuroimaging studies or when attempting to understand how different types of prosocial decisions vary in terms of their underlying processes. \n\nDerived from the Latin stem   pro   and root   socius  , signifying \u2018for a companion\u2019, prosocial decision-making refers to \u2018decisions made for the benefit of another\u2019 ( ). Laboratory tasks that measure correlates of prosocial decision-making share one common feature: allowing deciding participants (or agents) to make choices that increase the welfare of a beneficiary. However, prosocial decisions vary widely as a function of other task features. For example, although choosing to forgo resources (usually money) to alleviate the suffering of a stranger (in a charitable donation task)   vs   choosing to contribute money to maximize equity among known members in a group (in a public goods game) both share a common prosocial core of increasing the welfare of others, these decisions diverge along multiple other characteristics. In the first example, a prosocial agent sacrifices resources in response to another person\u2019s distress with the understanding that they will not receive anything in return\u2014suggesting a likely role for empathic concern and planning for prosocial action without any anticipation of reward. In the second example, all prosocial agents are relying on the decisions of others and are hoping to increase the total pool of resources for everyone involved. This suggests a role for monitoring the expected actions of others\u2019 decisions and includes the anticipation of self-rewarding outcomes. \n\nIn addition to charitable donation tasks and public goods games, other common prosocial paradigms include dictator games, prisoner\u2019s dilemmas and trust games. Such tasks can be implemented with multiple variations, and the vast number of combinations of task features is a major source of heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises the question of whether common mechanisms underlie all prosocial choices. One possibility is that prosocial decisions in each distinct task are supported by distinct mechanisms. But it is more likely that taxonomic clusters exist within the task space of prosocial decision-making that reflect common underlying neural processes ( ). One way to identify such clusters would be via a bottom-up approach aimed at characterizing the task structure of prosocial decision-making by analyzing the way specific tasks cluster according to their low-level features. In other words, developing one level of a formal representation (or ontology) of cognitive tasks and their inter-relationships ( ;  ). The first goal of this paper was to clarify how different prosocial tasks are inter-related and how their low-level features give rise to broad categories of prosocial decisions. Then, using this information across various studies, we employed an unsupervised graph-based approach to generate a preliminary characterization of the neuroimaging task space comprised of the distinct and shared task features of prosocial decision-making paradigms. Finally, we conducted an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) meta-analysis to identify patterns of distinct and overlapping neural activation that correspond to the identified clusters of prosocial processes. \n\nBreaking prosocial decision processes down into their relevant task features may allow a better understanding of how prosocial decisions are inter-related, and how they diverge. In general, the features that distinguish these tasks involve those related to the   beneficiary   (Is the beneficiary a real or imaginary person (or persons) or an organization like a charity? Is their identity apparent to the agent? Is their need or distress known to the agent?), to the   interaction   (Does the beneficiary also make decisions that will affect ultimate outcome? Will the agent and beneficiary interact only once or more than once?) and to the   outcomes   of the agent\u2019s decision (What is the magnitude of the benefit to the beneficiary? Will the decision result in rewarding outcomes for the agent? Will it be costly? Will the decision conform to social norms, such as equity? How certain is the outcome?). Multiple combinations of these features likely shape the context, motivations and outcomes of prosocial decisions and thus should recruit diverging neural systems. \n\n### Features related to the beneficiary \n  \nVarious features related to the beneficiary of a prosocial decision are known to influence such decisions. Beneficiaries can include specific people, such as close or familiar others ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) or in-group members ( ;  ;  ; Wills   et\u00a0al.  ,  ) or can be hypothetical or even non-human (e.g. computers) ( ;  ). Across contexts, agents are typically more willing to help people than computers ( ) and are more willing to help people close to them than strangers ( ,  ;  ;  ). Neural activation during decisions that affect real   vs   imaginary beneficiaries (e.g. computer) is increased in regions important for theory of mind or inferring the mental states of others such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) ( ). \n\nIn tasks that include real beneficiaries who are previously unknown to the agent, the beneficiary may be another participant in study ( ) or an anonymous stranger ( ;  ;  ) who the agent may have briefly met before the task ( ;  ) or seen in a photograph ( ;  ). Receiving any identifying information about a beneficiary generally increases prosociality, in line with the identifiable victim effect ( ;  ;  ). This effect also results in greater prosociality toward single individuals   vs   collectives ( ;  ), including charitable organizations, whether predetermined ( ), of the agent\u2019s choosing ( ) or from a list of charities ( ;  ;  ). Increases in prosocial decision-making are particularly robust when the need or distress of the beneficiary is salient ( ;  ;  ;  ). Cues that signal need or distress typically elicit empathic concern, which motivates the desire to alleviate it ( ;  ;  ;  ). This form of empathy is supported by activity in neural regions including the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and empathic neural responding predicts prosocial decision-making both in and out of the laboratory ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Features related to the interaction \n  \nAspects of the interaction between agents and beneficiaries (or other agents) in prosocial tasks also influence agents\u2019 decisions, particularly when agents can learn about those with whom they are interacting. In some interactions, only one agent can influence the outcome. For example, in dictator games, agents unilaterally allocate resources between themselves and a beneficiary ( ). In others, multiple agents can shape the outcome. For example, in social dilemmas or trust games, agents can choose to cooperate with others in order to increase the total pool of available resources for everyone involved or can defect to obtain better outcomes for self ( ). Alternatively, in ultimatum games, agents receive feedback about their decisions from beneficiaries, who can accept or reject the offer ( ). \n\nSome prosocial decisions involve repeated interactions, which, unlike one-shot interactions, provide opportunities to reciprocate or respond to feedback about prior choices ( ). When repeated interactions are expected, it typically motivates cooperation, with agents motivated to pay short-term cooperation \u2018costs\u2019 to increase future reciprocity from a partner ( ;  ) and more willing to cooperate with partners who have cooperated previously ( ). This may be related to the ability to update expectations of others\u2019 likely behavior, a type of social learning is supported by the subgenual ACC ( ). During these repeated interactions, agents may also act to influence interaction partners to reciprocate, for example, when a cooperative exchange is broken and partners coax others back into cooperation via generosity ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Features related to outcomes \n  \nAcross interaction types, prosocial decisions are also shaped by their anticipated outcomes. In some cases, prosocial decisions may benefit the agent directly. In prisoner\u2019s dilemmas or public goods games, for example, decisions to cooperate increase the probability of future reciprocity. In such tasks, agents also take on the role of beneficiaries ( ;  ) and, thus, must arbitrate between their own and others\u2019 rewards. These tasks often recruit neural systems that support subjective valuation and reward expectancy, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral striatum (Wills   et\u00a0al.  ,  ,  ;  ). These tasks also carry an element of uncertainty ( ), with the agent\u2019s outcome often dependent on a beneficiary or trustee\u2019s choices ( ). Uncertainty during these decisions may be reflected through activation in the dorsal ACC ( ). \n\nProsocial choices may also yield more abstract rewards, such as conformity to desirable social norms like maximizing equity among multiple parties (via, for example, a 50\u201350 split of resources) ( ;  ;  ). In some cases, agents may choose to act prosocially and forgo resources to avoid deviating from desirable norm, which is known as disadvantageous inequity aversion ( ). Equitable interpersonal decisions are thought to engage neural structures involved in a computing subjective value such as the medial PFC and ventral striatum and thus may be motivated through increased intrinsic value placed on the decision ( ), perhaps via their goal of producing increased subjective happiness for agents and beneficiaries ( ;  ). In tasks with repeated interactions, these decisions may also reflect the maintenance of abstract, norm-based rules regarding fairness or reciprocity, in that repeated interactions can enable norms to become established among the interacting parties and maintained in dorsolateral PFC ( ;  ). \n\nIn other prosocial decision-making tasks (such as dictator games or charitable giving tasks), agents can forgo resources (including money, time, effort or safety) solely to benefit others. In this case, prosocial choices are made despite certain concrete costs to the agent, often to alleviate the beneficiary\u2019s distress or need. As described above, such decisions are thought to be driven by activation in regions like anterior insula, which represent negative affective states (e.g. pain or distress) of the beneficiary ( ;  ). Such choices also may yield indirect gains, including increases in mood or well-being ( ;  ;  ), possibly related to the vicarious reward of improving the beneficiary\u2019s welfare ( ); such vicarious reward may be supported by activity in ventral striatum and ventromedial PFC. \n\nGiven the diversity of extant prosocial decision tasks, two recent meta-analytic studies have been very valuable in describing the neural correlates of prosocial behaviors aggregated across tasks that reflect divergent constellations of the above variables.   aggregated across a wide range of tasks in which participants made decisions about others, rated others\u2019 traits or judged others\u2019 behaviors in an effort to find neural activation overlap among prosociality, empathy and mentalizing. They found four regions to be preferentially engaged across the tasks they incorporated: dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial PFC, dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC). Of these regions, they found a conjunction in dorsal PCC activation during tasks involving prosocial behavior and tasks involving mentalizing (understanding another person\u2019s needs and inferring goals across contexts); they also found a conjunction in MCC activation across tasks involving prosocial behavior and tasks involving empathy (resonating with another\u2019s needs) ( ). Activation during prosocial behavior in the dorsolateral PFC and ventromedial PFC did not overlap with activation during mentalizing or empathy tasks. This work identified common neural patterns underlying a range of behaviors related to prosociality, but, by not considering key differences among types of prosocial decisions, it was not able to identify whether they are supported by distinct processes.   provided preliminary evidence that distinct neural regions do indeed support different forms of prosocial decision-making, finding diverging patterns of activation for prosocial behaviors that do not provide an opportunity to gain extrinsic rewards (and thus likely are intrinsically motivated)   vs   those with the probability of gaining an extrinsic reward. For example, extrinsically motivated decisions recruited greater activity in striatal regions relative to intrinsically motivated decisions. In contrast, intrinsically motivated decisions recruited increased activation in ventromedial PFC relative to extrinsically motivated decisions. Activation in ventromedial PFC also differentiated these types along a posterior (intrinsic) to anterior (extrinsic) axis. \n\nHowever, the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation was determined in advance, rather than being driven by objective features of the data. This is also only one of many possible distinctions among forms of prosocial behavior. An alternative means of investigating neural substrates of various prosocial decision tasks could instead take a more bottom-up approach that identifies distinct clusters of tasks that emerge from statistical variation in their objective features or outcomes. For example, a recent behavioral study analyzed the behavioral outcomes of different economic prosocial tasks (such as the percentage of prosocial decisions during each task, the ratio of other-regarding to self-regarding decisions in each, average monetary donations or summary scores of self-reported measures). Using factor analysis, they determined that the prosocial tasks clustered into four factors that the authors termed: altruistically motivated prosocial behavior, norm-motivated prosocial behavior, strategically motivated prosocial behavior and self-reported prosocial behavior ( ). \n\nWe sought to use a similar bottom-up approach to meta-analytically investigate the neural correlates of prosocial decision-making during fMRI. We focused on objective features that distinguish the tasks themselves, which included features related to outcomes of decisions, to the beneficiaries of the decision and to the interaction between agents and beneficiaries. We first compiled data from 43 unique fMRI studies of prosocial decision-making (including 25 maps and 18 coordinate tables across 1423 participants). We then dummy-coded task features related to the beneficiary, interaction and outcome of each decision and employed a data-driven, graph-based approach to identify clusters of studies based on their overlapping   vs   distinct task features. As described in detail below, this approach indicated that the prosocial decision-making task-space comprises three clusters, which we labeled as cooperation, equity and altruism. We next used a meta-analytic approach that combined group-level statistical parametric images with reported peak-coordinates to identify divergent neural activation patterns across these clusters of studies. In so doing, the present study resolves some discrepancies in how prosocial decisions are conceptualized, expands understanding regarding how prosocial decisions are related and distinct and generates insight for future research. \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nA literature search using PubMed identified research published prior to June 2019 using keywords either (\u2018fMRI\u2019 or \u2018neur*\u2019) and one of the following: (\u2018prosocial\u2019, \u2018altruis*\u2019, \u2018trust game\u2019, \u2018fairness\u2019, \u2018reciproc*\u2019, \u2018cooperat*\u2019, \u2018charitable\u2019, \u2018public goods\u2019, \u2018dictator\u2019, \u2018ultimatum\u2019, \u2018prisoner*\u2019).  The search returned 201 articles. We removed 124 articles that did not meet key criteria, such as non-neuroimaging studies, neuroimaging studies that did not use fMRI and literature reviews or meta-analyses. Independently, we identified 123 potential articles from the reference lists of the remaining 77 articles. After removing all duplicate titles from the combined lists, 146 articles remained. We then selected only articles that reported novel whole-brain fMRI data (i.e. data only published once) that were collected while participants made decisions that benefitted another individual (prosocial decisions). We also limited our search to include only data from studies that were able to examine differences in activation during prosocial decisions relative to decisions that benefited the agent alone (selfish decisions). In some cases, this was a contrast between prosocial choices and selfish choices within a task condition or parametric modulation of the amount given. For other studies, the contrast was between decisions during a prosocial condition and a self-only condition. We did not include contrasts involving alternate control conditions (e.g. rest and visuomotor controls), even when these were available, due to significant variation in brain activation ( ). Upon review of the remaining 146 articles, 69 were identified that met our inclusion criteria. \n\nWe sent emails to the corresponding authors of all included studies to request unthresholded, group-level   t  -statistic map(s) from the study that best fit our criteria. For studies that included pharmacological manipulations or clinical populations, we requested data from only the control group. If maps were not available, we requested coordinates for contrasts of interests or extracted them from manuscripts. If a coordinate table reported Z-scores or Talaraich coordinates, peak values were transformed to   t  -statistics and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates, respectively. If the contrast of interest was reported in both directions (e.g. cooperate\u2009>\u2009defect and defect\u2009>\u2009cooperate), the selfish contrast peaks were assigned as negative   t  -values. Ultimately, we obtained the necessary data from 43 unique fMRI studies, including 25 maps and 18 coordinate tables that included data from 1423 subjects ( ). \n  \nDescriptions of studies included in meta-analysis \n  \n Note.   Some studies only reported gender as a proportion of the total sample, but not the final analytic sample. Researcher labels: C\u2009=\u2009Cooperative; E\u2009=\u2009Equitable; A\u2009=\u2009Altruistic. \n\nAbbreviation: SMI, self-maximizing inequity. \n  \n\n### Identifying task features across studies \n  \nWe first reviewed the details of the methodologies of all available tasks and identified 13 distinct task features that varied among existing prosocial decision-making tasks across neuroimaging studies ( ). These task features can be broken down into those that vary as a function of the beneficiary, the interaction and the outcome. Although in theory features related to the agent can also vary, all participants included in the present study were healthy control adults and we did not identify consistent features related to these participants\u2014for example, consistent individual difference measures\u2014in the available literature. Four independent raters dummy coded (\u2018present\u2019 or \u2018absent\u2019) the 13 features during the prosocial decision phase for the available contrast in each study with high initial agreement among coders (  ICC\u2009  =\u20090.82, CI \u2009=\u2009[0.79, 0.84]). Discrepancies in the initial coding were then resolved through a consensus agreement across each of the four coders. \n  \nBipartite feature x study incidence matrix. \n  \n\n### Identifying clusters within the task structure of prosocial decision-making \n  \nTo assess differential clusters of prosocial decisions based on their task features, we next applied an unsupervised, graph-based approach. Importantly, we selected an approach that allowed us to identify potential clusters of studies among tasks that all shared a common feature of \u2018producing a rewarding outcome to the beneficiary\u2019 (a crucial criterion for inclusion in our meta-analysis). Thus, we sought to construct a fully connected, weighted graph with studies as nodes and the degree of overlapping task features as weighted edges. To accomplish this, we first used the identified features to construct a bipartite graph. This graph contained two sets of nodes: nodes representing the 13 different task features and nodes representing the 43 different prosocial decision study contrasts. In this graph, an edge exists between a feature node and a study node if the study contrast contained the task feature (  depicts this graph in matrix form). Next, we projected this bipartite graph onto a weighted network of studies, where edge weights between studies represented the Dice similarity coefficient ( ) or the degree of overlapping task features relative to the total possible task features ( ). We then ran the Louvain community detection algorithm ( )\u2014a common unsupervised clustering algorithm used across the biological, psychological and social sciences that detects clustering of nodes in a fully-connected, weighted graph ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This approach assigned study nodes to clusters in two steps. First, the algorithm finds small clusters of studies by optimizing local modularity. Second, it aggregates studies of the same cluster in a hierarchical fashion and builds a new network whose nodes are these clusters. These steps were repeated iteratively until the global modularity was maximized (i.e. global modularity is achieved when the connections between studies within the same clusters are strongest and connections between nodes in different clusters are weakest). The resulting hierarchy of studies across clusters in the study network is depicted in  . To assess the stability of the identified three-cluster solution, we implemented a Jackknife sensitivity analysis, which exhaustively left one study out prior to generating the study network and applying Louvain community detection. We then computed (i) the percentage of iterations that yielded the same number of clusters (three clusters) in the study network and (ii) the proportion of studies that switched to a different cluster. \n  \nGraph depiction of study network generated from overlapping task features. \n  \n\n### Neuroimaging preprocessing and meta-analyses \n  \nWe next conducted meta-analyses combining reported peak information (coordinates and   t  -statistics) with original statistical parametric maps using the anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping software (AES-SDM, version 5.141;  ). We selected this analytical technique rather than alternatives, such as coordinate-based activation likelihood ( ;  ), because this approach enabled the utilization of precise, continuous estimates of effect sizes, assessment of between-study heterogeneity and identification of potential publication bias ( ). Using AES-SDM, within-study, voxel-level maps of effect sizes (  Hedge\u2019s g  ) and their variances were re-created for each study. When only reported coordinates and statistics were available for a study, we calculated the effect size at each peak and estimated effect sizes in neighboring voxels based on the Euclidean distance between voxels and the peak using a 20\u2009mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian function ( ,  ). This method of estimation is similar to the estimation of activation likelihood used in peak-probability meta-analytic methods, but the use of effect sizes in the calculation increases the accuracy of estimation of the true signal ( ). When the   t  -statistics of the peak coordinates were unknown (one study:  ), we imputed the effect size with the extent threshold reported in the study. \n\nWe used three random-effects models to compute a meta-analytic activation for each prosocial category identified using the Louvain community detection algorithm. Each individual study was weighted by the inverse sum of its variance plus the between-study variance as obtained by the DerSimonian\u2013Laird estimator of heterogeneity ( ). Within this random-effects framework, studies with larger sample sizes or lower variability contribute more and effects are assumed to randomly vary between study samples. To assess statistical significance, we implemented a modified permutation test that empirically estimated a null distribution for each meta-analytic brain map. We thus tested the hypothesis that each map\u2019s true effect sizes were not the result of a random spatial association among studies within a prosocial category. We applied a threshold of   P   \u2009  <\u20090.005 as recommended by   to optimally balance specificity and sensitivity while yielding results approximately equivalent to   P   \u2009  <\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Reported z-scores are specified as SDM-Z, as they do not follow a standard normal distribution. We also conducted three pairwise comparisons of activation maps across each of the three prosocial categories, which followed the same procedures ( ). \n\nThe effect size maps were imported into Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) ( ), and a conjunction analysis was conducted to examine the overlap of consistently activated regions across altruism, cooperation and equity. Conjunction was determined using 3dcalc by overlaying the thresholded meta-analytic maps for each category to determine activation overlay. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clustering tasks into categories of prosocial decision-making \n  \nThe Louvain clustering algorithm revealed three clusters of prosocial decision-making tasks ( ). Upon inspection, we labeled these clusters based on the task features (or lack of features) shared among decisions within each cluster. Decisions in the first cluster (red;   N  \u2009=\u200919; 8 maps, 11 coordinate tables) involved multiple agents acting prosocially to maximize resources. These decisions were characterized by features like outcomes depended on the decisions of others and decisions in conditions of uncertainty. Tasks included prisoner\u2019s dilemmas, public goods games, ultimatum games played by proposers, trust games and non-economic cooperative tasks. We labeled this cluster as   cooperative decisions  . A second cluster of decisions (yellow;   N  \u2009=\u200910; 7 maps, three coordinate tables) were those in which unilateral decisions to apportion resources equally were possible. These decisions were characterized by features like adherence to social norms such as producing equitable outcomes for the agent and beneficiary and unilateral decisions made by a single agent (and that thus resulted in no uncertainty). Tasks included dictator games in which 50\u201350 splits were possible. We labeled this cluster as   equitable decisions  . Finally, a third cluster of decisions (  N  \u2009=\u200914; 10 maps, four coordinate tables) was those in which agents made unilateral decisions to forgo resources for others. These decisions were characterized by losses without receiving anything in return and decisions that were made in response to the need or distress of the beneficiaries. Tasks included charitable donation tasks, dictator games in which 50\u201350 splits were not possible, your pain, my gain tasks and assistance tasks. We labeled this cluster as   altruistic decisions  . We will refer to each cluster using these terms, with the recognition that alternate descriptions for each cluster could also be appropriate. For example, the cluster of tasks we labeled as \u2018cooperative\u2019 could alternately be labeled as \u2018strategic\u2019 ( ). Crucially, sensitivity analyses (iteratively leaving one study out prior to generating the network and applying community detection) revealed that 100% of iterations yielded a three-cluster solution. The stability of these clusters was also high with 97.7% of nodes in the study network remaining in the same cluster; only one study ( ) out of the forty-three studies ever switched from the cluster labeled as \u2018cooperative\u2019 to the cluster labeled as \u2018equity\u2019. \n\n\n### Meta-analyses \n  \n#### Neural correlates of cooperative decisions. \n  \nIn the cooperative decision cluster, prosocial decisions (in contrast to selfish decisions) were associated with increased activation in right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral subgenual ACC, left ventral striatum (including caudate nucleus), bilateral insula, bilateral MCC, left supramarginal gyrus extending to superior temporal gyrus (STG), left lateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral ventral tegmental area (VTA), left thalamus, left precuneus, right cerebellum lobule VIII and bilateral occipital cortex. We did not find significantly increased activation in any region during selfish   vs   cooperative decision-making ( ,  ). \n  \nThresholded results from meta-analyses. \n    \nResults from the meta-analyses \n  \n\n#### Neural correlates of equitable decisions. \n  \nIn the equitable decision cluster, prosocial decisions (in contrast to selfish decisions) were associated with increased activation in bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), bilateral ventrolateral PFC, bilateral dorsolateral PFC, bilateral medial PFC including rostral ACC, bilateral ventral striatum and caudate and left occipital cortex. Activation was increased during selfish relative to equitable decisions in left dorsolateral PFC, medial portion of left precentral gyrus, lateral portion of bilateral precentral gyrus, left thalamus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and bilateral occipital cortex ( ,  ). \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of altruistic decisions. \n  \nIn the altruistic decision cluster, prosocial decisions (in contrast to selfish decisions) were associated with increased activation in several regions including left ventromedial PFC, bilateral ACC and paracingulate gyrus, bilateral pre-SMA, bilateral anterior insula, right ventrolateral PFC, left bilateral dorsolateral PFC, thalamus, right ventral striatum, right precuneus and bilateral interior parietal gyrus. \n\nWe also found increased activation during selfish decision-making, in contrast to altruistic decision-making, in several regions including right dorsolateral PFC, right ventrolateral PFC right putamen, bilateral posterior insula, bilateral precentral gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), STG, right STS left parahippocampal gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus and left cerebellum crus I and II ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n### Pairwise meta-analytic map comparisons \n  \nPairwise comparisons confirmed that the meta-analytic maps derived from each cluster of studies were distinct from one another. When comparing activation for cooperative relative to equitable decisions, we found increased activation in regions that included left ventrolateral PFC, left SMA, right caudate, left hippocampus, bilateral thalamus, left VTA, left supramarginal gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus ( ). We did not find increased activity in any region for equitable relative to cooperative decisions. When comparing activation for equitable relative to altruistic decisions, however, we found increased activation for equitable relative to altruistic decisions in regions that included right ventrolateral PFC, bilateral posterior insula and right STG ( ). \n\nWhen comparing activation for altruistic relative to equitable decisions, we found increased activation in regions that included dorsolateral PFC, bilateral pre-SMA, left anterior insula, bilateral caudate, left thalamus and left hippocampus ( ). Finally, when comparing activation for altruistic relative to cooperative decisions, we found increased activation in regions that included left dorsolateral PFC, left SMA, left MTG and left angular gyrus ( ). We did not find increased activity in any region for cooperative relative to altruistic decisions.   for results. \n\n\n### Conjunction across meta-analytic maps \n  \nConjunction analyses identified overlapping regions of activation for altruism \u2229 equity and cooperation \u2229 equity. Overlapping activation for altruism \u2229 equity was observed in bilateral dorsolateral PFC (BA9\/46; left: [\u221244, 34, 20], k\u2009=\u200919; right: [46, 40, 24], k\u2009=\u200924), left ventrolateral PFC (BA10; [\u221242, 44, \u22124], k\u2009=\u200932) and left visual cortex (BA18, [\u221220, \u221296, \u22128], k\u2009=\u200934). Overlapping activity for equity \u2229 cooperation was observed in bilateral ventral striatum (left: [\u22122, 4, \u22128]; right: [4, 4, \u22128]; k\u2009=\u20094). We did not find overlapping activation for cooperation \u2229 altruism nor did we find overlapping activation across all three clusters of studies (cooperation \u2229 equity \u2229 altruism). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing data from 43 unique fMRI studies that included 25 statistical maps and 18 coordinate tables across 1423 subjects, we identified 13 features that distinguish prosocial decisions tasks. We used these features to generate a feature-based representation of prosocial decision tasks that classified prosocial decisions into three sub-clusters that we subsequently labeled as cooperation, equity and altruism. The feature-based structure we generated identified conceptually and motivationally coherent categories of prosocial decisions. This conclusion is supported by the results of our fMRI meta-analysis, which found evidence suggesting that each category of decision recruits diverging neural systems. The first cluster of decisions (which we labeled as   cooperative  ) primarily recruited regions such as dorsal and ventral striatum, VTA and subgenual ACC. A second cluster of decisions (which we labeled as   equitable  ) recruited neural regions such as ventral striatum, dorsolateral PFC and ventromedial PFC. A third cluster of decisions (which we labeled as   altruistic  ) recruited neural regions such as ventral striatum, dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial PFC, pre-SMA, dorsal ACC and anterior insula. \n\nOur approach demonstrates that the dozens of tasks that have been used to assess the neural correlates of prosocial decisions generally cluster together according to specific shared features. These tasks are adaptations of those used in studies of prosocial decision-making outside the scanner and more broadly. We identified key features that distinguish prosocial decisions, including features related to the identity of the beneficiary, the nature of the interaction between agents and beneficiaries and various outcomes associated with the decision. Then, using an unsupervised graph-based approach, we identified three clusters of tasks that tend to share common core features. For example, cooperative decisions included outcomes that depended on the decisions of others (e.g. \u2018beneficiaries make choices that affect the outcome\u2019) and decisions in conditions of uncertainty. Features shared by equitable decisions included adherence to social norms such as producing equal outcomes and unilateral decisions made by a single agent and that thus resulted in no uncertainty. Features shared by altruistic decisions included outcomes that did not produce any benefit to the deciding agent and unilateral decisions that were made in response to the need or distress of the beneficiaries. Of note, the prosocial decision-making tasks included in this meta-analysis were described by the original authors using at least 10 different terms that did not consistently correspond to the features of the tasks being used\u2014including cooperation, collaboration, reciprocity, trust, equity, fairness, prosocial behavior, interpersonal behavior, charitable behavior and altruism\u2014reinforcing the value of a clearer and more consistent prosocial decision-making task space. \n\nSupporting the identified task structure, the clusters yielded by our approach map closely onto the results of a previous behavioral characterization of prosocial paradigms that applied factor analysis to the behavioral outcomes of these paradigms ( ). These outcomes included the percentage of prosocial decisions during tasks, the ratio of other-regarding   vs   self-regarding decisions, average monetary donations or summary scores of self-reported measures. Using a similar bottom-up, but otherwise completely distinct approach across 329 participants who completed multiple tasks-assessing prosocial behavior, the authors identified clusters of prosocial tasks that correspond to those we identified: altruistically motivated prosocial behavior (corresponding to the cluster labeled as   altruistic   decisions), norm-motivated prosocial behavior (corresponding to the cluster labeled as   equitable   decisions) and strategically motivated prosocial behavior (corresponding to the cluster labeled as   cooperative   decisions). They also identified self-reported prosocial behavior (a category not included in our meta-analysis) as comprising a fourth distinct cluster. \n\nOur findings also extend this work by showing that tasks cluster similarly even when completed by different participants across tasks. This suggests task features are crucial in determining the category of a prosocial decision and has implications for comparing results across different tasks, such as in previous meta-analyses. In addition, our findings suggest that even within a type of task, specific features may determine the category of prosocial decision at hand. For example, dictator games that offered an option to split available resources equally (50\u201350) clustered with equitable decisions, whereas dictator games with the option to make other prosocial splits clustered with altruistic decisions. The existence of strong norms related to equity may explain why 50\u201350 is the most common non-selfish split across dictator games when this choice is available ( ). Future analyses of dictator game tasks, particularly those conducted using fMRI, could benefit from considering that there may be something unique about the decision to split resources equally (50%) rather than it simply existing as an option on a parametric continuum between 49 and 51%. \n\nOur approach also yielded several important observations about the neural substrates of prosocial decisions. Notably, all three clusters of prosocial decisions recruited the striatum, but each category of decisions elicited activation in different regions within the striatum. We found that cooperation recruited the left caudate and bilateral ventral striatum, equity recruited right caudate and bilateral ventral striatum and altruism recruited right ventral striatum. Previous work suggests these differences may be explained by how tasks in the three clusters vary in value and uncertainty. Activity in the striatum has been consistently found to encode action value during learning and decision-making ( ;  ). In some tasks (primarily cooperative and equitable decisions), prosocial decisions increased the agent\u2019s own welfare. In other tasks (primarily altruistic and equitable decisions), prosocial decisions meant forgoing resources. Importantly, in economic games involving simultaneous decisions by multiple agents, cooperative decisions are usually made with some uncertainty about the ultimate outcome. It is possible that the striatal activity observed during cooperative decisions also reflects the uncertainty of decisions, which is recruited during decision-making under risky or uncertain conditions ( ;  ;  ). The only overlap of striatal activation we identified occurred in a small volume of four voxels during both cooperative and equitable decisions. This conjunction may reflect the fact that cooperative and equitable decisions benefit both agents and beneficiaries, which may be recapitulated in ventral striatal activity. \n\nThis suggests the possibility of an additive effect of striatal activity\u2014an interpretation consistent with observations of a parametric effect of striatal activation and reward magnitude for self ( ). Ventral striatum is also preferentially engaged in response to rewarding social stimuli relative to rewarding nonsocial stimuli, for instance, when participants cooperate with a human partner relative to a computer partner despite identical monetary gains ( ,  ). This also might explain why we did not observe any consistent regions that were more active during selfish decisions than cooperative decisions. Cooperative decisions, which yield outcomes benefiting both the agent and other beneficiaries, are also potentially more rewarding than decisions that only yield self-rewarding outcomes. Cooperative decisions also uniquely recruited activity in bilateral VTA, which projects dopamine to the ventral striatum in response to positive prediction errors and reward cues ( ), and activity in which likely reflects the anticipation of both the self- and social-rewards gained from cooperating with others. \n\nStriatal activation to anticipatory reward cues occurs within a larger subjective valuation system, which consistently involves activity in the medial PFC during reward-based decision-making ( ) and prosocial decision-making ( ;  ). As has been previously found ( ), we observed activation in more anterior portions of the ventromedial PFC (including the rostral ACC) during equitable decisions that produce self-enhancing, norm-based outcomes and activation in more posterior portions during altruistic decisions. These results are consistent with a hypothesized spatial gradient of activation along the medial PFC during prosocial decision-making ( ), which may integrate information about self and others to encode an overall value during a prosocial decision ( ). \n\nActivation in both ventral striatum and medial PFC did not overlap between altruistic decisions and cooperative decisions. In contrast to altruistic decisions, which recruited the lingual gyrus portion of left ventromedial PFC, we found activation in bilateral subgenual ACC during tasks that require agents to cooperate with others to achieve a common goal. This suggests that altruistic and cooperative decision represent distinct processes, despite frequent conflation these two categories of decisions in the literature, for example, when altruistic behavior (choosing to benefit others without any self-gain) is labeled as \u2018cooperation\u2019 ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Because the subgenual ACC supports prosocial learning computations ( ;  ) as well as preferences for socially rewarding outcomes ( ), it may also play a role in updating expectations of others\u2019 actions or the value of others\u2019 outcomes during iterative cooperative decision-making. \n\nIn addition to a subjective-valuation sub-system, altruistic decisions seemed to recruit two other distinct sub-systems underlying goal-directed behavior and empathy. The goal-directed sub-system included regions typically implicated in controlling action and directing goal-directed behaviors, including the lateral PFC ( ;  ;  ). Importantly, activation for equitable and altruistic decision-making overlapped in dorsolateral PFC, involved in modulating subjective value representations ( ;  ) and in making norm-related decisions ( ;  ). Thus, it may play an important role in guiding prosocial action in accordance with abstract, social rules during social decision-making tasks ( ). \n\nThe second sub-system comprised regions commonly involved in representing and empathizing with the distress of others, and included the dorsal ACC, pre-SMA and anterior insula ( ;  ;  ). Activation in these regions emerged only during altruistic decisions, consistent with the theory that affective resonance with others\u2019 distress give rise to empathic concern and altruistic motivation, which is a primary motivator of prosocial behavior in the absence of cooperative or equity-maintaining goals ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ). This finding was likely driven by eight out of the fourteen identified altruistic studies including stimuli that depicted or implied the need or distress of beneficiaries. We also found activation in the precuneus\u2014a key node of the mentalizing system ( )\u2014during altruistic decisions. This region has also been found to be active in response to observing emotional suffering ( ;  ;  ). Although some hypothesize the right TPJ\u2014another core region of the mentalizing system\u2014to be recruited during prosocial decision-making ( ;  ), we did not find differential activation in this region across prosocial relative to selfish decisions. It is possible that we did not observe differences in mean activation because both selfish and prosocial decisions require the maintenance of others\u2019 beliefs and intentions, whereas studies finding TPJ activation usually contrast decisions pertaining to other people with hypothetical decisions pertaining to imaginary people (or computers) ( ) (for further evidence regarding the role of TPJ during domain-general social   vs   self-specific decision-making, also see:  ,  ). \n\n\n## Limitations and future directions \n  \nThese results should be considered in light of some limitations. We could not obtain complete data from a number of potentially relevant studies. At least 69 studies would have been eligible for the analysis if we had been able to retrieve the necessary data. In addition, while the 13 features we identified captured the distinctions across the tasks included in our analysis, they may not be representative of all features that could potentially overlap across tasks. With access to more data, future work could test how clustering algorithms such as the one we employed can generalize to unseen tasks with different combinations of features or even generate new tasks with unique sets of task features. Another limitation of our approach is that we used a binary coding for our features (1\u2009=\u2009present and 0\u2009=\u2009absent), which did not make any prior assumptions about the features (e.g. no assumption that features were parametrically weighted). Therefore, we were unable to test how strongly each feature contributed to the three-cluster solution (since they were all weighted equally). \n\nWe identified how tasks were inter-related using a bottom-up feature-based approach (assuming equally important features), and how these inter-relationships give rise to overarching prosocial categories. This is in contrast to the more top-down approaches based on expert-models that have been used to map cognitive constructs like creativity ( ), cognitive control ( ) or theory of mind ( ) onto tasks. Future work could combine these approaches to generate a finer grained task space for prosocial decision-making including all possible levels of its cognitive ontology: the categories identified in the present study, finer detailed sub-categories, task paradigms and their features weighted according to their relative importance and contrast estimates. In so doing, we could go further in solving discrepancies within the prosocial decision-making literature, such as delineating more specific categories of prosocial decision-making within the identified task-space, which may only reflect the top level of a prosocial decision-making hierarchy. Our data show evidence of such a prosocial decision hierarchy across clusters of studies ( ). However, future work, with an adequate number of studies on prosocial decisions, will be needed to demonstrate that such a hierarchy can be recapitulated using meta-analytic brain maps (see  ) (especially with increasing availability of other studies that prompt prosocial decisions). Other categories of decisions likely also exist within this hierarchy. For example, active decisions to forgive ( ), norm-enforcing decisions (i.e. social influence on agreements or valuation) ( ;  ;  ;  ) and third-party altruistic punishment decisions for norm violations ( ;  ;  ;  ) were not considered in this study because we sought to only examine decisions that directly benefited another person but may reflect more specific prosocial decisions under the umbrella of the identified categories. \n\nAs with many neuroimaging tasks, prosocial decision-making tasks adapted for neuroimaging are tightly controlled and often designed to minimize variability and maximize the statistical power of detecting effects. However, they are not designed with high ecological validity and may not map onto the contexts of real-world prosocial decisions such as holding a door open, splitting a meal, volunteering or donating blood or an organ. Instead, they are primarily monetary in nature, repetitive and may increase behaviors related to social desirability in the laboratory ( ). Recent work has focused on making neuroimaging paradigms more \u2018naturalistic,\u2019 such as viewing or listening to narratives or interacting in real time with another person in the laboratory ( ;  ;  ;  ) or in the real world ( ). Other work has concentrated on characterizing the behavioral and neural features of individuals who engage in extreme forms of real-world prosociality ( ;  ;  ;  ). Understanding the neurobiology underlying more ecologically valid altruistic decisions will be crucial for understanding the broader picture of prosocial decision-making. \n\nRelated to this, we were not able to consider how individual differences in phenotypic traits may contribute to the neural activity patterns observed across prosocial decision-making tasks due to the limited number of studies that collect or report consistent data on participant characteristics, yet this remains an open question. Finally, we only considered univariate maps that contrasted prosocial   vs   selfish decisions (or assessed a parametric increase). Due to the high variability of contrasts across studies, this allowed us to generate consistent neuroimaging contrasts that only indexed activation during the decision phase across studies. This approach is distinct from other meta-analytic work compiling coordinate-based maps across any contrasts in prosocial tasks ( ;  ), which run the risk of creating dependence across experiment maps that negatively impacts the validity of meta-analytic results ( ). Ideally, future work would incorporate neural activation maps derived from computational modeling of behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which holds promise for understanding individual differences in social learning and decision-making ( ). For example, computational modeling of decisions can identify latent subjective states (e.g. mood, anxiety), beliefs about others (e.g. trust, morality) or other subjective biases about agents that are not directly observable from behavior. Thus, mapping these latent parameters onto the task features that give rise to them and their neural representations will be a necessary next step in characterizing a cognitive ontology of prosociality. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDespite limitations, the present study provides a framework for understanding how prosocial decisions are inter-related and distinct and can be applied to a variety of experimental task paradigms. Using a bottom-up approach, we identified a feature-based representation of the task-space underlying prosocial decisions. Results revealed that three clusters of prosocial decisions identified this way\u2014cooperative, equitable and altruistic decisions\u2014recruit neural systems that diverge in ways that shed light on the key motivations and mechanisms that support each category of prosocial decision compared to selfish decisions. These findings clarify some of the existing heterogeneity in how prosociality is conceptualized and generate insight for future research in task paradigm development and the improvement of formal cognitive ontologies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8717062,"text_md5":"c70ce5b7fe0e405dec5c856663a7afba","field_positions":{"authors":[0,51],"journal":[52,76],"publication_year":[78,82],"title":[93,199],"keywords":[213,281],"abstract":[294,1766],"body":[1775,53870]},"batch":1,"pmid":34160604,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsab079","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8717062","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8717062"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8717062\">8717062<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8717062  A feature-based network analysis and fMRI meta-analysis reveal three distinct types of prosocial decisions"}

However, trying to make money out of market forecasts can trigger all types of emotional responses. As the question on how investors decide remains controversial, we carried out an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have reported whole-brain analyses on subjects performing an investment task. We identified the ventral striatum, anterior insula, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex as being involved in this decision-making process. These regions are limbic-related structures which respond to reward, risk and emotional conflict. Our findings support the notion that investment choices are emotional decisions that take into account market information, individual preferences and beliefs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \n\u201cTo invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What\u2019s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework\u201d [ ] (p. ix). While there is no agreement on how emotions influence these decisions, there is a common understanding that expert investors are wired to weigh expected rewards and risks while making financial decisions. We believe that this kind of knowledge, acquired by a combination of formal training and on-the-job experience, is a trait of the brain. \n\nWhat is interesting about this decision-making process is that it is all about expectations learned from experience, by constantly readjusting these predictions to the actual results [ ]. A decision, whether risky or safe, begins with fluctuations of dopamine within the reward circuit [ ]. However, to come to a decision, this process must integrate information coming from reward circuits as well as brain regions involved in cognition [ ]. \n\nAlthough activity in dopaminergic brain areas has been shown to occur with both immediate and delayed rewards, in 2004, McClure et al. demonstrated that there are two distinct systems involved in choices between monetary reward options available at different moments in time [ ]. On the one hand, decisions that entail immediate rewards involve the ventral striatum, the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [ ], all of which are activated by the receipt of rewards [ ]. On the other hand, intertemporal choices of delayed rewards engage the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the parietal cortex [ ]. These latter areas of the brain are known to be implicated in the control of cognitive functions and goal-directed behavior, including the modulation of working memory information through rewards [ ] and the representation of task-reward associations [ ]. \n\nHow, then, do investors choose between different types of rewards? The answer lies in a common scale of values. Thus far, neuroimaging studies in humans have highlighted the ventromedial prefrontal cortex\/orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC\/OFC) as the key brain area for representing the subjective values of all reward types on a neural common scale and, to a much lesser extent, the ventral striatum [ ]. The most feasible explanation is that the vmPFC computes these values by trading off costs and benefits from the amygdala and the ventral striatum, respectively [ ]. Other areas, such as the anterior insula (AIns), engage with rewards by having a negative correlation with increasing anticipated monetary reward [ ] as well as a positive correlation, mainly with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when a decision conflict arises between options of competing value [ ]. Therefore, the brain appears to be equipped with a unified valuation network to compare between rewards. \n\nOn the contrary, risk is determined by the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are estimated by individual perceptions based on previous experiences. How these evaluated probabilities influence investors\u2019 decisions depends on the amount of information available (risk) or, rather, the information that is unknown to the investor (ambiguity). Several studies have associated activation between risk and ambiguity with distinct brain areas. Usually, risk activates the insula, the striatum and the parietal cortex, whereas ambiguity involves the lPFC, the mPFC, the cingulate cortex and the amygdala [ ]. \n\nAs opposed to rewards, the scientific community is still hesitant to draw strong conclusions about a unified neural system for evaluating decisions at all levels of uncertainty, despite the fact that the AIns is thought to encode changes in the amount of variability (risk) as well as risk prediction errors [ ]. In 2005, Hsu et al. suggested a common neural circuit which was positively activated in the amygdala and the OFC and negatively in the striatum as uncertainty increased [ ]. However, in 2019, FeldmanHall et al. ruled out these areas and stated that only the lPFC played a key role in processing high levels of uncertainty [ ], despite its correlation with individual ambiguity preferences [ ]. Nevertheless, all these areas are involved in the regulation of emotional responses, whether evoked consciously or automatically by the stimulus itself [ , ]. \n\nPsychological and neuroscientific research has emphasized that emotions play a role in decision-making, but it remains unclear how they influence risk processing and risk anticipation. Anticipatory effects in distinct neural circuits can impact financial choices [ ]. For instance, risky and safe investments are predicted by ventral striatum and anterior insula activation, respectively [ ]. It appears as if two parallel processes occur when a person makes an investment choice. On the emotional level, activity in the AIns assesses potential losses, while the thalamus can anticipate regret in the case of loss. On the cognitive level, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) evaluates risk by using the information provided by the AIns and the thalamus [ ]. To decide, the parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) must combine the information about risk with the expected reward obtained from those areas [ ]. \n\nIt is not fully known which neuronal circuits drive investment decisions. An unbiased way to understand what leads a person to make some investments and not others is by using the coordinates reported from all task-related neuroimaging studies to determine brain activation while investing. Our aim is to summarize the structures specialized in responding to investment decision-making by conducting an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis from individual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have reported whole-brain analysis results during an investment task. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nThis meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines [ ]. \n\n### 2.1. Eligibility Criteria \n  \nWe included studies that analyzed decision-making via investment tasks in healthy human adults without any other restrictions, such as language, publication date or text availability. Studies were eligible if they included fMRI as the only neuroimaging technique used and if they reported original data from whole-brain analysis results. We excluded all studies whose participants had suffered brain injuries, had any diseases or had disorders. We selected those studies that assessed investment decisions using financial assets. Furthermore, we restricted our selection to peer-reviewed articles. \n\n\n### 2.2. Information Sources and Search \n  \nStudies were identified in the following electronic databases: WOS, PubMed and PsycINFO. The only filters used were species (humans) and age (adults). The search terms included the following: investment decision making; investment risk taking; investments; financial decisions; financial risk taking; investors; traders; trading (decisions); stock market; stock exchange; portfolio; market bubbles; financial bubbles; brain; and fMRI (see   for the search strategy using the WOS database). \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Collection Process \n  \nInformation was collected using a spreadsheet under the following headlines: authors, title, year of publication, number of participants, sex, age, stimuli, aim, behavioral results, brain activation and coordinates. If a study reported Talairach coordinates, we transformed them into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the icbm2tal algorithm implemented in the GingerALE toolbox ( : available on 7 December 2020). \n\n\n### 2.4. Meta-Analysis of Brain Activation Coordinates \n  \nGingerALE (version 3.0.2) was used to run the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm [ , , ]. GingerALE meta-analytic software reveals concordant brain regions among the provided imaging studies, using random effects analysis to test the maximum activation probabilities against a null hypothesis of spatially independent activations. Cluster-level family-wise error thresholding at   p   < 0.01 was used to correct for multiple comparisons [ ] due to its increased power and compromise between sensitivity and specificity. An initial cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) was used, and 1000 permutations were applied. \n\n\n### 2.5. Visualization \n  \nWe used Caret v5.65 software to project the cortical results into a three-dimensional population-average landmark and surface (PALS-B12), using an enclosing voxel algorithm and fiducial mapping [ ]. The subcortical slices were generated with in-house Matlab scripts. The ALE values of the meta-analysis were projected with a threshold of 0.0025 for visualizing the trend. Black borders were used to delineate the surviving regions to multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nThe search on the WOS, PubMed and PsycINFO databases was conducted from October 2020 to November 2020 and provided a total of 495 studies. Once duplicates had been removed, 350 studies were screened on the basis of titles and abstracts. We discarded 322 articles, as they did not meet the eligibility criteria; 106 studies belonged to a different population (participants with disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, healthy elderly people, adolescents and children), 165 studies did not involve an investment task with financial assets, 28 studies had no original data, and 23 studies used other techniques (electroencephalography, positron emission tomography or transcranial stimulation). Then, the full text of the remaining 28 studies were examined, and 12 studies were excluded due to the fact that they did not report whole-brain analysis results. As a result of the selection criteria, 16 studies were selected for the meta-analysis ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Study Characteristics \n  \nAll articles employed some type of investment decision-making task. Four studies focused on the role that previous investments had on current decisions [ , , , ], while the rest concentrated on trading tasks. \n\nThe information presented was essentially market data. However, three studies also shared social information [ , , ], and one included the responses from a computer partner as a control condition [ ]. Only one study presented the stimuli under gain and loss domains [ ], whereas three studies used market bubble conditions [ , , ]. \n\nEight studies focused on certain cognitive processes while choosing between investments, including sunk costs [ , ], disposition effects [ ] and prediction errors [ , , ]. \n\nSome studies included other behavioral tests with the same participants whose brains were being scanned. For example, questionnaires were conducted on the future time perspective [ ], eye gaze [ ] and self-assessment questions [ ]. \n\nThe included studies involved 594 healthy adults without any real-life experience in investing, except for one study [ ]. Two studies included only males [ , ], and two did not report the sexes of the participants [ , ]. \n\nAll sixteen studies were conducted with fMRI and were published between 2005 and 2018. \n\n\n### 3.3. Study Results \n  \nRegarding studies with prior investments, it has been demonstrated that previous investments affect current decisions, making people more prone to continue investing. This is related to higher activation not only in the prefrontal and parietal cortices [ , , ], but also in the anterior insula, due to its role in risky decision-making [ , ]. This latter brain area, along with the ventral striatum, has been repeatedly found to be active in tasks involving trading decisions [ , , , , , , , ]. \n\nStudies which included social information reported a higher activation in the ventral striatum when investors decided to follow herd buying behavior [ ], as well as in the paracingulate cortex while forecasting price changes [ ]. On the contrary, overweighting private information involved activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, the anterior insula [ ] and the ACC to resolve social conflicts that arose from going against the group [ ]. However, this does not apply if the information is non-human [ , ]. In the study on gain and loss domains, only the former, along with the anterior insula, could be related to real-life experience in trading stocks [ ]. With respect to market bubble conditions, higher levels of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and vmPFC activity [ , ] and dlPFC and inferior parietal lobule connectivity [ ] indicate a propensity to ride bubbles and lose money. \n\nInvestment decisions can be affected by certain cognitive processes, such as higher sunk costs translating into more risk-taking behaviors in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices [ , ]; a higher disposition effect lowering ventral striatum activity because investors held onto losing assets longer [ ]; fictive errors driving investment behavior through increased activity in the ventral striatum [ , ]; and decreased activity in anterior insula and anterior insula-amygdala connectivity when reappraisal strategies regulated negative feelings [ ]. \n\nStudies with behavioral tests linked the estimation of future prices with activation in the inferior parietal lobule and future time perspective scores [ ]; the ability to infer other investors\u00b4 intentions with signal changes in the dmPFC and eye gaze scores; and beliefs and preferences toward risk (risk optimism index and risk tolerance index) with activation in the anterior insula and real-life trading experience [ ]. \n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-analysis of Brain Activation Results \n  \n and   display the results of the ALE meta-analysis we conducted. The four clusters we found were (1) ventral striatum + amygdala + anterior cingulate cortex; (2) the ventral striatum; (3) the anterior insula; and (4) the occipital cortex.   shows the characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis with the clusters reported by each study. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIt is not surprising that the first three clusters we found included areas of the brain that are closely related to the expectation of reward and risk, as investments are based on risk\u2013return tradeoffs. The fourth cluster, the occipital cortex, is activated during investment decisions as market information gathered via computers is perceived through the visual pathway. Nevertheless, while investors consider the need to control their emotions in order to not interfere with their investment decisions, these same brain regions are also involved in emotions when assessing the value of environmental stimuli. Although areas such as the vmPFC\/OFC did not survive multiple comparisons,   shows that there was a tendency, which confirmed a role of these regions in investment decision-making, probably as a common scale of values. These results lead us to believe that investment choices are emotional decisions. \n\nGenerally, perceived risks (AIns) and risk attitudes (lateral OFC) seemed to affect the value of the chosen investment (dlPFC and amygdala) [ ]. Prior to deciding, value was correlated with mPFC, lPFC and posterior cingulate cortex activity [ ], whereas distinct neural circuits involving the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the AIns seemed to promote risk-seeking and risk-averse choices, respectively [ ] ( ). However, while excessive activation in these areas may cause investment mistakes [ ], reduced activation could lead to a learning process in which emotion regulation in fictive error signals (i.e., what might have happened) could guide valuation and choice [ ] ( ). These differences between actual returns and returns that could have been experienced if decisions had been diverse also drive investment behavior through significant ventral caudate and posterior parietal cortex activation [ ] ( ). \n\nSeeking environmental validity for these results, we found an attempt to connect real-life financial behavior with brain activation during an investment task. H\u00e4usler et al. [ ] demonstrated that choosing between a stock and a bond involved differences in brain activation in the AIns ( ). Active stock traders showed lower AIns activation when choosing the risky option (stock) compared with those who did not trade in real life [ ]. This may be due to individual differences in risk attitudes [ ] and the way in which investors perceive risks [ ]. Therefore, this difference was not based on cognitive abilities or financial constraints, but rather mediated by individuals\u00b4 preferences and beliefs about risky financial choices [ ]. \n\nIn financial markets, prices are determined by the interacting decisions of many investors. Inferring other agents\u00b4 intentions while making value judgments can lead to an increase in prices above their fundamental values, causing a market bubble. Under these conditions, social signals activate the paracingulate cortex [ ] and the dmPFC [ ], which affect value representations in the vmPFC [ ], an area known to be associated with asset preferences [ , ]. This increased sensitivity in the vmPFC toward other investors\u00b4 intentions makes activity in this brain area a predictor of the tendency to ride bubbles [ ] ( ). Although investors can be predisposed to buying stocks in market bubbles, the vmPFC has also been found to correlate with cash holdings [ ], probably due to its activation after monetary gains [ ]. Nonetheless, functional connectivity in the vmPFC decreased as bubbles gave way to an increase in dlPFC\u2013inferior parietal lobule (IPL) connectivity ( ), since supportive information is required from the IPL to estimate future stock prices so that the dlPFC can decide [ ]. \n\nAnother brain area that is thought to track bubble magnitude, responding to both buying and selling outcomes, is the NAcc [ ]. Increased NAcc activity is associated with lower returns [ ], given the propensity to buy risky assets [ ] in subsequent trading periods ( ). By contrast, if the activity occurs in the AIns, it will serve as a risk detection signal that will result in higher earnings, due to a higher propensity to sell before the bubble reaches its peak [ ] ( ). \n\nWhile there is no universally acknowledged explanation of how bubbles form, it is known that herd behavior often causes higher volatility in the stock markets [ ], both up and down, as investors decide to get in or out at the same time. The reason for this behavior is that when faced with uncertainty, investors tend to imitate the actions of others. Activity in the ventral striatum is influenced by social information on other investors\u2019 decisions, making one\u00b4s decision to buy or reject more in line with the stock bought or rejected by the herd [ ], even when there is no advantage in doing so [ ]. One feasible reason is that the striatum engages in prediction error signals, helping us learn the value of different options [ ]. Aligning with the group also activates the amygdala [ ], which may reflect a social learning process [ ], and the middle cingulate cortex due to its sensitivity in identifying oneself with other investors\u00b4 behaviors [ ]. However, if investors do not base their decisions on the behavior of others and act against the group, activity in the ACC increases to solve the social conflict that arises [ ] ( ). This would imply that investors update their beliefs by overweighting private information instead of social information, which results in higher activation of the inferior frontal gyrus\u2013AIns and lower activation of the parietal-temporal cortex, areas known to be associated with risk and uncertainty [ ]. \n\nIt is evident that information can alter financial decision-making, especially if prior investments have been made. Throwing good money after bad in order to avoid realizing certain losses is a cognitive bias that investors are sensitive to. This effect, known as sunk costs, demonstrates that the amount of money that has already been allocated affects the decision of whether to continue an investment or not. When sunk costs are higher, activity in the lPFC, the parietal cortex [ ], the amygdala and the ACC increases [ ], given the desire to not appear wasteful [ ]. At the same time, investors stop tracking the expected value of new investments to focus on previous investments to guide their current decisions so that the participation of the vmPFC and the NAcc in this decision process is considerably diminished, thereby making them prone to continue investing [ ]. It has been found that there is a strong negative connectivity between the dlPFC and the vmPFC after an investment is made as a way to not waste resources while overriding the commonly expected value-based decision-making [ ]. \n\nAccording to Kahneman and Tversky [ ], aversion to loss realization is one of the reasons why investors fall into sunk costs, a fallacy that may strengthen the disposition effect. The disposition effect is a behavior which leads investors to \u201csell winners too early and ride losers too long\u201d [ ], based on an irrational belief in mean reversion [ ]. There is a negative correlation between the disposition effect and ventral striatum activity related to rises in asset prices [ ] ( ). Expecting a return to the mean could be the reason behind an attenuated striatal response to upticks in value below the purchase price [ ], given that dopamine neurons respond more strongly to unpredicted rewards [ ]. \n\nThere are three main limitations to this review. The first limitation comes from a small sample size, considering that neuroeconomics is still a new field and most of the studies to date have focused on specific regions of interest instead of whole-brain analysis. The second limitation arises from the different stimuli and aims used in all investment decision-making tasks. For example, some studies have presented stimuli in a moving display or used live trading, which resemble more closely what happens in real-life financial decisions, as opposed to static stimuli trying to evoke actual dynamic markets. The third limitation derives from the lack of active stock traders as participants, except for the study by H\u00e4usler et al. [ ], given that environmental factors can shape individual financial decisions. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nInvestment decisions can overwhelm the brain. Trying to make sense of all information that financial markets convey while listening to one\u00b4s emotions without being overridden by them involves a coordinated effort of several brain areas in order to reach a decision. Since the question of how investors make decisions has not yet been fully uncovered, the aim of this meta-analysis is to determine the convergence of brain regions necessary for this complex decision-making process. Based on our ALE meta-analysis results, investment decisions involve limbic areas that ponder reward vs. risk, as investment portfolios are built on trying to achieve an optimal balance between return and risk. Emotions toward these two concepts, and the emotional conflicts that can arise while prioritizing among them, are an influential factor that guide this decision process. As Benjamin Graham has noted, \u201cindividuals who cannot master their emotions are ill-suited to profit from the investment process.\u201d Despite the four clusters found, we believe that investment decisions are not limited to those areas alone. In the stock market, aspects such as when to buy or sell, the market conditions or even the way in which other investors behave can affect whether an investment will result in being profitable or not. As Warren Buffet once advised, \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Every investor knows how to be fearful and greedy, but what they truly need to discover is when the right time to be one or the other is. The same investment behavior and the same brain activation could lead to different yields depending on the moment. Determining the role of a specific brain area in this decision-making process is indeed a complicated endeavor. Herein lies the difficulty in understanding how investors make decisions. Given the scarce literature, future studies should continue addressing this decision-making process while including whole-brain analysis in their methods. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8003996,"text_md5":"89a29bb0f837fa10fc43ce4c8a9e793f","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,70],"publication_year":[72,76],"title":[87,137],"keywords":[151,261],"abstract":[274,1166],"body":[1175,25491]},"batch":1,"pmid":33801075,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci11030399","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8003996","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8003996"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8003996\">8003996<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8003996  An ALE Meta-Analysis on Investment Decision-Making"}

Selection and stopping are often investigated separately, but they appear to recruit similar brain regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and inferior frontal gyrus. We therefore examined the evidence for overlap of selection and stopping using two approaches: a meta-analysis of existing studies of selection and stopping, and a novel within-subject fMRI study in which action selection and a stop signal task were combined factorially. The novel fMRI study also permitted us to investigate hypotheses regarding a common mechanism for selection and stopping. The preSMA was identified by both methods as common to selection and stopping. However, stopping a selected action did not recruit preSMA more than stopping a specified action, nor did stop signal reaction times differ significantly across the two conditions. These findings suggest that the preSMA supports both action selection and stopping, but the two processes may not require access to a common inhibition mechanism. Instead, the preSMA might represent information about potential actions that is used in both action selection and stopping in order to resolve conflict between competing available responses. \n   Highlights  \n  \nGingerALE meta-analysis shows overlap of action selection and stopping in preSMA. \n  \nWithin-subjects fMRI study confirms overlap using same stimuli and subjects. \n  \nAlthough selection and stopping overlap, there is no behavioural interaction. \n  \nThe preSMA may support the representation of competing action options. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSuccessful goal-directed behaviour requires the selection of an appropriate response for the task at hand. The intentional selection of a response from several alternatives is a hallmark of voluntary action, and can take the form of choosing   what   action to perform,   when   to act, or   whether   to act at all ( ). The cognitive neuroscience of \u201c  what  \u201d type action selection has a long history, but has been described using a range of terminology, including \u201cwilled action\u201d ( ,  ), \u201cfree selection\u201d ( ,  ) and \u201caction selection\u201d ( ,  ). This type of action decision has been consistently associated with a characteristic set of fronto-parietal activations in neuroimaging ( ,  ,  ,  ), including the inferior and middle frontal gyri, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), premotor cortex, and the inferior parietal cortex, regions resembling the \u201cmultiple-demand\u201d network ( ). \n\nIn addition to the selection of actions, goal-directed behaviour may also require the stopping of inappropriate responses. The indication that an action is inappropriate may come before a response is triggered, by the prevailing rules or context, or it may be concurrent with prepotent cues for action, as in Go\/NoGo tasks. Stop cues may also occur shortly after the action has been triggered, indicating the need to cancel the action while it is being selected or prepared. This \u201ccancellation\u201d type of stopping is exemplified by the stop signal task ( ,  ), in which a cue to respond is followed after a short delay (typically 200\u2013300\u00a0ms) by an instruction to cancel the action. \n\nIntriguingly, similar patterns of activation have been reported from neuroimaging studies of action selection and stopping tasks. Regions associated with successful stopping on stop signal tasks include the inferior frontal gyrus, preSMA, and inferior parietal cortex ( ,  ,  ). These observations raise the possibility that action selection and stopping are supported by similar brain regions, perhaps even by similar neural populations within these regions ( ,  ). However, the overlap of selection and stopping in prefrontal cortex, the preSMA, and inferior parietal cortex. \n\nWe examined the anatomical relationship between selection and stopping of voluntary action using two methods. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of action selection and stopping studies to examine overlap in activation during these two tasks across studies. This method has the advantage of pooling results from a very large number of individuals. However, such a meta-analysis is based on different groups of subjects performing   either   action selection   or   stopping tasks, and has limited anatomical precision. Moreover, the particular task requirements vary across tasks and studies. \n\nTo complement the meta-analytic approach, we developed a novel task that combined selection with stopping. Using this task and event-related fMRI, we examined the anatomical relationship between selection and stopping in the same subjects, affording improved anatomical resolution over that available in meta-analytic approaches, and also matching of task requirements and stimuli across selection and stopping trials. \n\nAn anatomical overlap of selection and stopping raises a further question, of why the two aspects of voluntary action control show similar regional activations. There are several possible explanations for overlapping cortical activations for selection and stopping. Our novel fMRI task, in which selection and stopping were combined factorially, provided an opportunity to explore these alternative explanations: by examining the neural and behavioural interaction between selection and stopping, and the activations arising when subjects must stop an action they have selected themselves. \n\nWe sought to test a general hypothesis regarding anatomical overlap of selection and stopping: that both cancellation of an action that is in preparation ( ), and selection between possible actions, require inhibition. For example, action selection or action reprogramming may require either the inhibition of current valid alternative options, or the inhibition of previous actions in a sequence ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). It is possible, therefore, that both action selection and stopping utilise inhibition (see also  ,  ). \n\nWe identified three possible outcomes from our combined task in relation to this hypothesis: (1) if action selection and stopping both engage a common inhibitory mechanism, then performing action selection and stopping simultaneously, or in close temporal proximity within the same trial, would be expected to affect stopping performance. A beneficial effect on stopping efficiency (i.e. shorter SSRT with less BOLD activation) would be seen if selection is mediated in part by inhibition of alternative responses, such that stopping could be \u201cprimed\u201d by performing selection within the same trial ( ). (2) A cost effect on stopping efficiency (i.e. longer SSRT, with more BOLD activation) would be seen if selection and stopping share a common inhibitory mechanism with limited resources, resulting in a cognitive \u201cbottleneck\u201d ( ) when subjects have to both select and stop within the same trial. (3) There might be no difference in the SSRT and BOLD activation, even when selection and stopping proceed simultaneously, or within close temporal proximity. This would suggest that selection and stopping might operate on common action representations but not require a shared inhibitory mechanism (cf.  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### GingerALE meta-analysis \n  \nThe action selection studies in our meta-analysis were included according to specific criteria, as the concepts and definition of \u201caction selection\u201d can vary between studies and researchers. Here, we define action selection as a decision about   what   action to perform, selecting from a range of alternatives, and contrasted against the performance of similar single actions specified by the experimenter (see  ). Alternative concepts of \u201caction selection\u201d were not included, such as   when   to perform an action specified by the experimenter,   whether   to execute a given action at all, or combinations of these action decisions (see  ).   \nThe combined selection and stopping task. Trials can be either \u201cspecified\u201d or \u201cselect\u201d. On specified trials, subjects press the button indicated by a green circle above the corresponding finger. On select trials, subjects can choose which finger movement to make from four equally valid alternatives. 75% of trials are go trials, in which a signal to stop never occurs and subjects execute the movement. 25% of trials are stop trials, in which after a short variable presentation of the green go cue, an auditory signal (1000\u00a0Hz tone) and visual cue (change in colour of circle(s) to red) indicates subjects should withhold their response. \n  \n\nThe action stopping studies in our meta-analysis were selected according to specific criteria. Only studies that used a stop signal task were included, in which the stop cue is presented after the go cue (Go\/NoGo tasks were excluded). Additionally, we included only contrasts of \u201ccorrect stop\u201d trials versus \u201cgo\u201d trials. Stop signals in either the auditory or visual modality were permitted (the stop signal in our combined fMRI study comprised both an auditory and visual cue). \n\nWithin these selection and stopping studies, additional criteria were required for inclusion: (1) manual response, as opposed to a saccade; (2) healthy adult subjects (if a clinical study, separate results must be reported for the control group); (3) whole-brain analysis with report of MNI or Talairach coordinates; and (4) if separate studies used the same data from a single group of subjects (e.g.  ,  ) the data is included in the meta-analysis only once. Both fMRI and PET studies meeting these criteria were included, as some of the earliest action selection studies used PET as the imaging modality. Three PET studies were included in the action selection meta-analysis, each of which used H2O PET. \n\nThe large majority of the selection and stopping studies included in the meta-analyses used right-handed subjects, although three studies did not specify subject handedness ( ,  ,  ), and one study included a single left-handed subject with a group of 18 right-handed subjects ( ). In 53% of the selection and 44% of the stopping studies, subjects were required to make actions with their right hand only, whilst in the remainder of the studies, subjects were required to make actions with either their left or right hand from trial to trial (or this information was not reported). See   for details of all the included studies, and the Supplementary Material for study references.   \nStudies included in the action selection and stop signal GingerALE meta-analyses. R\u00a0=\u00a0right-handed actions, L\u00a0=\u00a0left-handed actions, B\u00a0=\u00a0both right- and left-handed actions, NS\u00a0=\u00a0not specified, A\u00a0=\u00a0auditory stop cue, V\u00a0=\u00a0visual stop cue. See Supplementary Material for study references. \n  \n\nStudies meeting these criteria were identified using PubMed searches with the following search terms: \u201caction selection\u201d, \u201cresponse selection\u201d, \u201cmovement selection\u201d, \u201cfree selection\u201d, \u201cwilled action\u201d, and \u201cself movement\u201d (selection); \u201cstop signal\u201d (stopping). The large number of search terms used to identify action selection studies reflects the wide range of terminology historically applied to describe this concept. In March 2012, a total of 17 studies, containing 24 appropriate contrasts, were identified for selection, and 16 studies, containing 19 appropriate contrasts, were identified for stopping. These studies reported a total of 231 foci for selection (10 outside the brain mask used in the meta-analysis process) and 268 foci for stopping (11 outside the brain mask). \n\nWe used the BrainMap GingerALE tool, version 2.3 ( ) to perform two separate meta-analyses of selection and stopping studies, and then to perform a conjunction of these two ALE meta-analyses (selection AND stopping). An ALE (Activation Likelihood Estimation) analysis uses the peak coordinates of activations from multiple published studies to identify regions associated with performance of a cognitive task across the multiple studies, giving a large total number of subjects and enhanced power ( ,  ). \n\nFor the two separate meta-analyses of selection and stopping, any studies reporting Talairach coordinates instead of MNI were converted to MNI space using the Talairach to MNI transform as implemented in GingerALE. In the GingerALE analysis, we then applied the following options in addition to the default settings: non-additive ALE method ( ); output cluster minimum volume, 100\u00a0mm ; and FDR   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. The resulting thresholded ALE map was viewed in MRIcroN ( ) and the anatomical labelling of foci facilitated by the Anatomy toolbox ( ) in SPM8 ( ). \n\nTo perform a GingerALE conjunction (action selection AND stopping), we selected the \u201ccontrast studies\u201d option in GingerALE, with the previously generated selection and stopping ALE maps as inputs. The same options used in the previous selection and stopping ALEs were applied and permutations testing carried out with 10,000 iterations. A threshold of FDR   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 was applied to the conjunction image. \n\n\n### Combined selection and stopping fMRI study \n  \n#### Subjects and task \n  \n21 healthy right-handed subjects were recruited from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit volunteer panel. Four subjects showed poor behavioral performance, and were excluded before further analysis (3 subjects showed high \u201cgo\u201d trial omission error rates: 41\u201349%, close to 2 standard deviations beyond the mean go omission rate of the 21 subjects of 11%; 1 subject showed low stop accuracy: 35%, close to 2 standard deviations beyond the mean stop accuracy of 47%). The data from 17 subjects (age\u00a0=\u00a020\u201338, mean age\u00a0=\u00a028, 12 males) were analysed further. The study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee, and all subjects gave informed written consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\nSubjects underwent fMRI during a combined selection and stopping task ( ). Subjects were presented with a picture of a right hand with four circles, one above each finger. A change in colour of the circles from the grey background colour to green indicated a movement should be initiated (a right hand button press on a magnetic resonance-compatible four button box). There were two trial types: \u201cspecified\u201d or \u201cselect\u201d. On a \u201cspecified\u201d trial, a single circle changed to green above the corresponding finger the subject should press with. On a \u201cselect\u201d trial, all four circles changed to green, and subjects chose which finger to press with. On \u201cselect\u201d trials, subjects were asked to \u201cmake a fresh response on each trial, using any of the four buttons, regardless of what you have done before\u201d, comparable to previous studies using the same action selection paradigm ( ,  ). During both specified and select trials the green circle movement cues were presented for 1000\u00a0ms, during which time subjects were required to respond. If subjects failed to make a response, a negative feedback cue was superimposed on the hand picture for 500\u00a0ms post-trial. An inter-trial interval varying in length between 2000 and 8000\u00a0ms comprised continuous presentation of the hand picture with no change in the grey background color of the dots. The stimulus-onset asynchrony varied between 3000 and 9000\u00a0ms (mean: 4500\u00a0ms), resulting in greater design efficiency. \n\nSubjects first completed 20 go-specified and 20 go-select trials in a preliminary section, during which they were advised that no stopping would be required. This provided an estimate of their reaction times, and familiarised subjects with performance in the scanner. The action selection task was then combined with a stop signal task ( ). On 25% of specified and 25% of select trials, after a short variable delay, the green \u201cgo\u201d cue changed to a red \u201cstop\u201d cue in conjunction with an auditory stop signal (a 1000\u00a0Hz tone 100\u00a0ms in duration), indicating the subjects should withhold their response. Subjects were instructed not to anticipate the stop signal, and that they should prepare a movement on each trial. If subjects incorrectly made a response on these stop trials, a red negative feedback cue was superimposed on the hand picture for 500\u00a0ms post-trial. This increased attention to task performance and maintained motivation over a 50-minute task performance period. The initial starting delay between the \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d cues was set at the subject's reaction time from the preliminary go-trial only section, minus 225\u00a0ms (defined on the basis of pilot studies in healthy young adults). Two initial starting delays were defined, one for specified, and one for select trials, as we hypothesised stopping might function differently on the two trial types (mean initial specified starting delay: 351\u00a0ms; mean initial select starting delay: 401\u00a0ms). Staircase tracking algorithms modified the delay between go and stop cues on a trial-by-trial basis to maintain overall successful stopping at 50%. We used three parallel algorithms, maintaining stopping probability at 30%, 50%, and 70%, for both specified and select trials respectively (total of six trackers). The use of three tracking algorithms (with high, medium and low stopping probability rates) reduces the tendency for subjects to strategically slow their responses on stop signal tasks. Subjects completed 432 go trials (216 specified, 216 select) and 144 stop trials (72 specified, 72 select), during continuous imaging, but divided into 6 blocks of equal length with a rest break of 20\u00a0s between blocks. Trial order was fully randomised. \n\nThe stop signal reaction time (SSRT) measures the efficiency of response inhibition, with lower SSRTs indicative of less time required to inhibit a response. Subjects' SSRTs were calculated according to the \u201cintegration method\u201d described by  : all go trials with a response were ranked according to reaction time in descending order (fastest to slowest). If   n   is the probability of incorrectly responding on stop trials, and   t   the number of go trials in rank order of reaction time, the SSRT is calculated as the difference between the reaction time of the (  n  *  t  )th trial and the subject's mean stop signal delay. The integration method is a commonly used algorithm for estimation of SSRT throughout the stop signal literature, and is particularly beneficial when successful stopping does not perfectly converge on 50% ( ). SSRTs calculated according to the integration method are reliable across runs and across sessions ( ). We assessed whether SSRT differed between stop-specified and stop-select trials with a repeated measures   t  -test (SPSS 19.0, IBM). \n\nPrevious stop signal studies have observed a \u201ccarry-over\u201d inhibitory effect from a stop trial to a subsequent go trial, such that reaction times on   n  \u00a0+\u00a01 go trials are longer than when not preceded by a stop trial ( ,  ). We assessed the impact of preceding trial type (go or stop) on subsequent   n  \u00a0+\u00a01 go trial reaction times using a repeated measures analysis of variance with factors of preceding trial (go or stop) and action type (selected or specified) (SPSS 19.0, IBM). \n\n\n#### Functional MRI acquisition and pre-processing \n  \n1450 BOLD-sensitive T2*-weighted echo-planar images were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3\u00a0T (repetition time\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms, echo time\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms, 32 descending oblique slices 3\u00a0mm thick with 0.75\u00a0mm slice gap, in-plane resolution 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm). The first five images were discarded to allow for steady-state magnetisation. A high resolution MPRAGE structural scan of each subject was acquired for subsequent registration purposes (repetition time\u00a0=\u00a02250\u00a0ms, echo time\u00a0=\u00a02.99\u00a0ms, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm  resolution). fMRI pre-processing and statistical modelling used SPM8 in matlab version 7, with Automatic Analysis scripts ( ). Images were converted from dicom to nifti format, re-aligned to the mean image and sinc interpolated in time to correct for slice timing during volume acquisition. The MPRAGE was co-registered to the mean echo planar image, using normalised mutual information. The MPRAGE was iteratively segmented and normalised to the SPM MNI152 structural template. The resulting normalisation parameters were then applied to all the re-aligned and slice-time corrected echo planar images. The normalised images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of full-width half-maximum 8\u00a0mm. \n\n\n#### Functional MRI modelling and statistics \n  \nFirst level analysis for each subject used an event-related general linear model, with covariates indicating the onset of each trial. Events were modelled with a duration of 500\u00a0ms after trial onset, as this time-point captures both selection and stopping processes. Trials were convolved with the default SPM canonical hemodynamic response function, and defined in the design matrix using 8 regressors: preliminary go-select and go-specified trials; main task go-select, go-specified, stop-specified-correct, stop-specified-incorrect, stop-select-correct, and stop-select-incorrect trials. Any go trials on which an error was made (for example, not responding within the 1000\u00a0ms presentation of the go cue, or pressing with the wrong finger on a specified trial) were modelled separately. Six nuisance regressors modelled subject movement in translations and rotations. Contrast images of interest were calculated from the main task for the following: go-specified, go-select, stop-specified-correct, and stop-select-correct. \n\nFor the second-level analysis, a flexible factorial design was used, with \u201ctask\u201d as the first factor, and \u201csubject\u201d as a second factor. Contrast images using parameter estimates from correct go trials were included in the second level models (whilst incorrect trials were not included). In keeping with much of the previous stop signal literature (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), to examine stopping we used correct stop trials (response successfully withheld). We examined the following second-level contrasts of interest, across the whole-brain: (1) action selection (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified), equivalent to the \u201cselect\u00a0>\u00a0specified\u201d contrasts entered into the \u201cselection\u201d meta-analysis; (2) stopping of specified actions (stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified), equivalent to the \u201ccorrect stop\u00a0>\u00a0go\u201d contrasts entered into the \u201cstopping\u201d meta-analysis; (3) stopping of selected actions (stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select); (4) the interaction between action selection and stopping\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0[(stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified)\u00a0>\u00a0(stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select)]; and (5) the conjunction between action selection and stopping (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified AND stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified). \n\nThe resulting statistic images for the first three contrasts (action selection and stopping) were thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-based FDR (with   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 voxel level) ( ). The interaction and conjunction contrasts were threshholded for whole brain analysis at the liberal exploratory threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, and then corrected for multiple comparisons within a small volume correction mask based on the preSMA peak focus in the meta-analysis conjunction (action selection AND stopping). For the small volume correction mask, we took the y and z co-ordinates from the location of the peak preSMA ALE statistic in the meta-analysis conjunction (y\u00a0=\u00a018, z\u00a0=\u00a048), and to be sensitive to both left and right hemisphere preSMA, set the x co-ordinate to 0. Then, in SPM we generated a 12\u00a0mm sphere centred on this co-ordinate (0, 18, 48) and using this mask, applied a small volume correction for multiple comparisons correction to both the interaction and conjunction contrasts. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### GingerALE meta-analysis \n  \nThe action selection GingerALE confirmed a pattern of fronto-parietal activity associated with action selection (\u201cselect\u201d\u00a0>\u00a0\u201cspecified\u201d), namely: bilateral preSMA, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral visual cortices (see  a and Supplementary Table 1).   \nGingerALE meta-analysis. (a) Action selection (select\u00a0>\u00a0specified) is associated with bilateral preSMA, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal cortex; (b) action stopping (correct stop\u00a0>\u00a0go) is associated with right preSMA, right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis, pars triangularis), left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), bilateral anterior insula, right premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal cortex; (c) conjunction of action selection and stopping (select\u00a0>\u00a0specified) AND (correct stop\u00a0>\u00a0go) shows the right preSMA, right premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal cortex as common to both processes. (a), (b), and (c) all shown at FDR   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05; the colour bar represents the ALE statistic, which increases in significance from bottom (red) to top (yellow). \n  \n\nThe action stopping GingerALE showed that successful stopping (\u201ccorrect stop\u201d\u00a0>\u00a0\u201cgo\u201d) has been associated with the right preSMA, right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis, pars triangularis), left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), bilateral anterior insula, right premotor cortex, bilateral inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral auditory and left visual cortices ( b, Supplementary Table 1). \n\nIn a conjunction meta-analysis, we asked which regions of the brain were associated with both action selection   and   stopping across the 17 action selection and 16 stop signal studies. The GingerALE conjunction identified the right preSMA, right premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal cortex as regions common to both action selection and stopping ( c, Supplementary Table 1). No regions within the inferior frontal gyrus were common to selection and stopping, suggesting that the inferior frontal foci identified in the separate action selection and stopping meta-analyses did not overlap, despite falling within the broader area described as inferior frontal gyrus. \n\n\n### Combined selection and stopping fMRI study \n  \n#### Behaviour \n  \n94% of go trials were correct. Subjects made omission errors on 3% of go trials (reaction time >\u00a01000\u00a0ms on both go-specified and go-select trials), and incorrect finger presses on 3% (e.g. index finger pressed in response to a middle finger cue on go-specified trials), attributed to fatigue. Subjects' reaction time (RT) on go trials during the combined task was shorter on go-specified than go-select trials (  t  (16)\u00a0=\u00a05.52,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001, mean specified\u00a0=\u00a0607\u00a0ms, mean select\u00a0=\u00a0634\u00a0ms). \n\nOn the stop trials, the tracking algorithms converged stop accuracy (i.e. response withheld) at 48% on stop-specified and 46% on stop-select trials (no significant difference between conditions;   t  (16)\u00a0=\u00a0-1.81,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.09). \n\nBehavioural indices of stopping performance were similar on stop-specified and stop-select trials. The stop signal reaction time (SSRT; indexing stop efficiency) was not significantly different on stop-specified and stop-select trials (  t  (16)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.59,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.57, mean specified SSRT\u00a0=\u00a0297\u00a0ms, mean select SSRT\u00a0=\u00a0292\u00a0ms) (see  ).   \nBehavioural performance on the combined selection and stopping task. Mean (range). \n      \n\nWe analysed the \u201ccarry-over\u201d effect ( ,  ) of a preceding stop trial on subsequent go trial RTs. The carry-over effect was not significantly different between stop-specified\/go-specified and stop-select\/go-select trials (interaction   F  (1,16)\u00a0=\u00a00.021,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.89, mean specified go RT\u00a0=\u00a0642\u00a0ms, mean select go RT\u00a0=\u00a0664\u00a0ms), although there was as expected an overall effect of a preceding stop trial on go RTs (  F  (1,16)\u00a0=\u00a06.59,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.01, mean go RT after stop trial\u00a0=\u00a0653\u00a0ms, mean go RT after go trial\u00a0=\u00a0605\u00a0ms). \n\n\n#### fMRI results \n  \n##### Action selection \n  \nWe used the same contrasts to analyse action selection to those entered into the \u201caction selection\u201d meta-analysis. Action selection (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified) revealed a network of fronto-parietal activity similar to that identified by the GingerALE meta-analysis, and our previous studies of action selection ( ,  ,  ), including the left preSMA, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction), left middle frontal gyrus (extending into the inferior frontal sulcus), bilateral premotor cortex, left inferior parietal cortex, bilateral visual cortices, and the left cerebellum (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FDRc;  a, Supplementary Table 2). There was a tendency for activations to be left lateralised: in the meta-analysis, action selection was also associated with right preSMA, right middle frontal gyrus, and right inferior parietal cortex, but these right sided regions were not observed at corrected thresholds in the current study. The left lateralisation observed here may be related to the task requirement for subjects to make right-handed actions.   \nfMRI results from the combined selection and stopping task. (a) Selection (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified); (b) stopping specified actions (stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified); (c) stopping selected actions (stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select); (d) negative (under-additive) interaction [(stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select)\u00a0>\u00a0(stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified)]; (e) conjunction (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified AND stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified). (a\u2013c) are thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FDRc. (d\u2013e) are illustrated at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, but the preSMA foci are significant (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE) within a priori small volume correction masks based on the preSMA peak focus in the meta-analysis conjunction (see  ). \n  \n\n\n##### Stopping specified actions \n  \nThe contrast \u201cstopping specified actions\u201d (stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified) is equivalent to the contrasts entered into the \u201caction stopping\u201d meta-analysis (as all the stop signal studies included in the meta-analysis required subjects to stop actions specified by the experimenter). The \u201cstopping specified actions\u201d contrast showed activations corresponding closely to the pattern identified by the GingerALE of stop signal tasks. This contrast was associated with bilateral preSMA, right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis, pars triangularis), left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis, pars triangularis), left insula, left inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral auditory and left visual cortices (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FDRc;  b, Supplementary Table 2). \n\n\n##### Stopping selected actions \n  \nA novel contrast, representing the stopping of responses that subjects had chosen themselves (stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select), showed activation in a subset of regions observed when stopping a specified action, including bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), bilateral insula, and bilateral auditory and visual cortices (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FDRc;  c, Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, regions often observed when stopping a specified action, such as bilateral preSMA, right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis), bilateral premotor cortex and bilateral inferior parietal cortex (see  b), were not reliably more engaged when stopping a selected action, compared to making a selected action. These findings do not support the notion that stopping a selected action makes heavier demands on a common mechanism underlying selection and stopping. \n\nTo test the null hypothesis of whether stopping a selected action (as opposed to stopping a specified action) was associated with an   increase   in demand for neural resources (for example, due to a cognitive \u201cbottleneck\u201d), we examined the contrast for a negative interaction. The interaction [(stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified)\u00a0>\u00a0(stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-select)] revealed very similar levels of activation associated with stopping a selected action and stopping a specified action in the left preSMA (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, correcting for multiple comparisons within a small volume mask based on the preSMA focus in the meta-analysis conjunction). At a more liberal exploratory threshold (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected) weaker negative interactions were seen in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction), left middle frontal gyrus (extending into the inferior frontal sulcus), right premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal cortex ( d, Supplementary Table 2). \n\nIn other words, when stopping a selected action, the preSMA activity did not represent the sum of \u2018selection\u2019 and \u2018stopping\u2019 activations observed when these tasks had been performed individually (see BOLD effect sizes in  ).   \nThe combined selection and stopping fMRI task reveals a significant negative interaction in the preSMA: BOLD effect sizes at the preSMA peak co-ordinate identified by the conjunction, for action selection (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified), stopping of specified actions (stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified), and stopping of selected actions (stop-select-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified). Each condition is shown contrasted against the go-specified baseline. \n  \n\n\n##### Action selection and stopping \n  \nThe conjunction analysis, identifying regions associated with both action selection and stopping (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified AND stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified), revealed conjoint activations in the left preSMA, right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction), left inferior frontal sulcus and left insula, at a liberal exploratory threshold (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected,  e, Supplementary Table 2). Using a region of interest based on the preSMA cluster identified by the meta-analysis conjunction, the conjoint activation of selection and stopping in the preSMA was significant at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE (Supplementary Table 2). \n\nThe conjunction analysis indicates that at the resolution of fMRI, and with the degree of spatial consistency across a group of subjects in a second level voxel-wise analysis, action selection and stopping are co-localised in these regions. At the specified thresholds, we did not observe co-localisation of action selection and stopping activations in the premotor cortex or inferior parietal cortex, regions which were identified in the meta-analysis conjunction. The right inferior frontal gyrus (inferior frontal junction) was identified by the combined fMRI study's conjunction analysis, but not the meta-analysis conjunction (above). Thus, the preSMA was the only region to be associated with both action selection and stopping in both the meta-analysis and within-subjects combined fMRI study. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAction selection and stopping are two elements of voluntary action control for successful goal-directed behaviour. Here we investigated selection and stopping together, to determine the potential similarities and interactions between them. Our aims were first to establish to what degree selection and stopping activations overlap; and second, to investigate why selection and stopping might show similar regional activations, with particular reference to the hypothesis that both selection and stopping utilise inhibition (also see  ,  ). \n\n### Overlap of selection and stopping \n  \nSimilar patterns of fronto-parietal activation have been reported in separate neuroimaging studies of selection and stopping ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). We approached the question of anatomical overlap of selection and stopping activations using two approaches, in order to take advantage of the relative benefits of each method: a meta-analysis of thirty-three selection and stopping studies, and a novel within-subjects fMRI experiment that combined action selection with the stop signal paradigm. Interestingly, using these two methods combined, we observed a more limited degree of overlap across selection and stopping than had been implied by a casual overview of existing separate studies. The preSMA was the only region associated with selection and stopping in both the meta-analysis and the within-subjects fMRI task. The meta-analysis also identified the premotor cortex and inferior parietal cortex as common to action selection and stopping (across subject groups). Our within-subjects fMRI results also identified the right inferior frontal gyrus (in the vicinity of the inferior frontal junction) as common to both selection and stopping within the same subject group, although this was not identified by the meta-analysis conjunction. \n\nThe meta-analysis conjunction identified the right preSMA as common to both selection and stopping, but the within-subjects fMRI study conjunction identified a peak in left preSMA. This may be related to the fact that different studies included in the meta-analysis had varying manual requirements: some studies used right-handed selection and stopping tasks, whilst others used bimanual tasks. In contrast, our fMRI experiment required only right-handed actions, leading to the left-hemispheric dominance of preSMA activations common to both selection and stopping. Moreover, the preSMA cluster identified in the meta-analysis conjunction crossed the midline (see  ). There may be functional differences for selection and stopping between the left and right preSMA regions, but the existing data do not provide strong evidence for lateralisation. \n\n\n### The preSMA and lateral prefrontal cortex in selection and stopping \n  \nHaving confirmed a significant degree of anatomical overlap of selection and stopping activations, we review the proposed roles for the preSMA and the inferior frontal gyrus in selection and stopping. We next consider why selection and stopping might show similar regional activations. \n\nIn both our meta-analysis and fMRI experiment, we found that action selection (go-select\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified) was associated with the preSMA, and lateral prefrontal cortex (middle and inferior frontal gyri). Despite the common co-activation of these regions in action selection tasks, a functional dissociation has been proposed between medial and lateral prefrontal regions for action selection. The preSMA has been associated with voluntary action generation, whilst lateral prefrontal cortex is also associated with monitoring recent action history, or implementation of task strategies in a sequence of action decisions ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). When several equally appropriate response options are available for voluntary action decisions, the preSMA may resolve conflict between those options ( ,  ). Such a situation arises either when there are no differential outcome values associated with the available responses, or when the value representations of the options, encoded by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), provide conflicting information about the optimal choice. One mechanism by which conflict resolution in action selection could proceed in the preSMA is via a competitive race between representations of the available responses ( ,  ). \n\nIn both our meta-analysis and fMRI experiment, we found that action stopping (stop-specified-correct\u00a0>\u00a0go-specified) was associated with the preSMA, and lateral prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyri). The role of the inferior frontal gyrus sub-regions (inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis, pars triangularis) in action stopping remains controversial ( ). Some studies suggested that the inferior frontal gyrus is critical for top\u2013down inhibitory suppression of actions ( ,  ), whilst others have suggested that the inferior frontal gyrus ( ,  ) and inferior frontal junction ( ) are associated with detection of a salient and behaviorally relevant target, such as stimuli relevant to stopping. \n\nWith a large corpus of stop signal and Go\/NoGo imaging studies, it is clear that activations labelled as \u201cinferior frontal gyrus\u201d cover a variety of cortical locations including the anterior insula, inferior frontal junction, pars opercularis, pars triangularis, and even pars orbitalis ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The presence of significant functional heterogeneity across these areas is suggested by anatomical differences in cytoarchitecture, receptor-architecture, and diffusion-based tractography ( ,  ,  ,  ). Our meta-analysis of stop signal studies identified several regions associated with stopping, within or adjacent to the \u201cright inferior frontal gyrus\u201d: specifically, the anterior insula, inferior frontal junction, inferior pars opercularis, and two clusters on pars triangularis, one dorsal and one ventral. In our fMRI experiment, the activations related to stopping a specified action extend from the right inferior frontal junction to right pars triangularis. Stopping a selected action (contrasted against executing such a chosen action) activated primarily pars triangularis. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that separate regions within or close to the inferior frontal gyrus may perform different roles in action stopping. \n\nIn contrast to the inferior frontal gyrus, the preSMA shows activation during stop signal tasks even when controlling for the effect of a salient task-relevant cue ( ). This suggests there may be a direct role for the preSMA in implementing inhibition to stop a motor response. \n\n\n### Selection and stopping for voluntary action: the role of preSMA \n  \nIn both the meta-analysis and within-subjects fMRI conjunctions, the preSMA was associated with both selection and stopping. The inferior frontal gyrus was observed in the within-subjects fMRI conjunction, but not the meta-analysis conjunction. While this discrepancy may be type II error, it is also possible that the within-subject design is more sensitive and anatomically precise than a between groups meta-analysis conjunction, especially in a region with fine grained functional heterogeneity, such as the inferior frontal gyrus. At present, the discrepancy across the two approaches calls for caution in interpreting the significance of co-localisation in the inferior frontal gyrus, and further replication is required. Here, we focus on the role of the preSMA, as it was identified by both analysis methods. \n\nThere are several potential explanations for common preSMA activation during selection and stopping. We proposed that a common cognitive process with a shared mechanism for selection and stopping might be inhibitory in nature: for example, action selection could include the inhibition of alternative actions, or the inhibition of previous actions in a sequence of action decisions ( ,  ), whilst action stopping might require the inhibition of an action currently in preparation ( ). The behavioural data and fMRI interaction provided tests of the hypothesis of a common inhibition mechanism for selection and stopping. We identified three possible outcomes: (1) performing selection within close temporal proximity to stopping could \u201cprime\u201d the inhibition mechanism, with the result that stopping is more efficient, i.e. shorter SSRTs, and less BOLD activation ( ); (2) sharing of cognitive resources could result in an inhibition \u201cbottleneck\u201d ( ), with the result that stopping is less efficient, i.e. longer SSRTs, and more BOLD activation; (3) selection and stopping might not require shared access to the same inhibitory process (cf.  ), resulting in no difference in either SSRT or BOLD activation when selection and stopping proceed simultaneously (or within close temporal proximity). \n\nThe behavioural data from the fMRI study were consistent with the third outcome: subjects' SSRTs were closely matched when subjects were required to stop actions they had selected on stop-select trials (SSRT\u00a0=\u00a0292\u00a0ms), and when they were required to stop actions specified by the experimenter on stop-specified trials (SSRT\u00a0=\u00a0297\u00a0ms). Since a difference may not be manifest in the stop trial itself, but in the consequences of stopping for subsequent trials, we also measured the \u201ccarry-over\u201d effect in stop signal tasks. We measured the impact of prior stopping on reaction time in subsequent go trials, to test whether the reaction times on   n  \u00a0+\u00a01 go trials were longer than when not preceded by a stop trial ( ,  ). We found that the inhibitory \u201ccarry-over\u201d effect on   n  \u00a0+\u00a01 go trial reaction times was the same regardless of whether the prior stop trial was specified (go RT\u00a0=\u00a0641\u00a0ms) or selected (go RT\u00a0=\u00a0642\u00a0ms). Thus, there was neither a significant behavioural inhibition cost, nor inhibition benefit, to stopping and selection within close temporal proximity (within-trial). In a recent behavioural study by  , SSRTs were found to be the same in both a standard stop signal task and a dual-task paradigm in which subjects were required to stop one response whilst executing another. Together, these SSRT findings suggest that an inhibitory process in stopping a response may not be subject to a dual-task bottleneck. \n\nExamining the fMRI data, we found a significant interaction between selection and stopping, indicating a significant under-additive effect ( d). This contrast tested the null hypothesis of whether stopping a selected action (as opposed to stopping a specified action) was associated with an increase in BOLD activation. The interaction contrast revealed significantly less activation than would be expected from simple addition of selection and stopping effects: there were very similar levels of activation associated with stopping a selected action and stopping a specified action in the left preSMA ( d,  ). \n\nTogether, these behavioural and fMRI results do not provide strong evidence that action selection and stopping share a   common inhibitory mechanism   in the preSMA. However, the failure to reject the null hypothesis does not rule this possibility out. Several alternative interpretations of the data warrant discussion. It is possible that   both   priming ( )   and   a \u201cbottleneck\u201d ( ) operate on select-stop trials, with the net result that any priming benefit to stopping, from performing selection within the same trial, is negated by selection and stopping being unable to proceed simultaneously. We note that on a given stop-select trial, we do not know how close in time action selection is to completion when the stop signal is received. This interpretation implies that selection and stopping are rapid, sequential processes within a stop-select trial, rather than concurrent. If that were the case, then our task alone does not resolve the question of whether such a shared inhibitory mechanism would be required simultaneously, or simply in close temporal proximity, between selection and stopping. However, a recent TMS study suggests that during action decisions, the selection among response alternatives does not complete before preparation of the chosen response ( ), providing evidence that an inhibitory mechanism to suppress alternative action representations could still be required within the same trial while a chosen action is prepared, overlapping in time with reception of a stop signal. \n\nAnother possibility underlying the co-localisation of selection and stopping to the preSMA, without a behavioural interaction, is that the medial frontal cortex monitors or detects response conflict and the need for cognitive control ( ). Detecting response conflict on stop-select trials might not require additional resources compared to the detection of response conflict on selection or stopping trials alone. The preSMA region we identify as associated with selection and stopping is dorsal to the anterior cingulate cortex, a different medial frontal region which is more commonly associated with detection or monitoring of conflict ( ,  ,  ). However, the functional localisation of conflict detection on the medial wall has been controversial and is still unresolved, with some evidence for a role of the preSMA as well as the anterior cingulate ( ). Once response conflict has been detected, if a response is required, conflict resolution should follow. Conflict resolution, as opposed to detection, has also been proposed as a function of the preSMA ( ,  ). \n\nConflict resolution is consistent with the co-localisation of selection and stopping to the preSMA: resolving conflict between competing available responses ( ,  ,  ), or conflict between a stop and go response ( ). The results of our fMRI study suggest that resolution of conflict on stop-select trials was comparable to the resolution of conflict on selection or stopping trials alone, and could be based on neuronal representations of multiple actions in motor association areas, including the preSMA ( ,  ). Both selection and stopping make use of, or access, such neuronal representations. Simultaneous access to different action representations would enable effective stopping on select trials without a further increase in BOLD response. \n\nWe propose that the preSMA supports the representation of competing potential actions, for both selection and stopping (cf.  ,  ,  ,  ). Signals from other regions may provide input to the preSMA to influence the representation of competing response options, resolving conflict between competing responses in selection trials, and between stop and go response in stop trials. For example, information on the outcomes of responses from the anterior cingulate cortex may influence action representations in the preSMA in action selection trials ( ,  ) while \u201cstop\u201d signals from the inferior frontal cortex in response to behaviorally relevant salient stimuli may influence action representations in the preSMA in stopping trials ( ,  ,  ,  ). The behavioural and fMRI results from our combined selection and stopping task are consistent with this model. The preSMA thereby supports both action selection and stopping by modulating representations of actions, when selection and stopping occur separately, or in close temporal proximity \u2014 such as on stop-select trials in our combined task. The stopping of selected actions is relevant to many real-world settings, when changes must rapidly be made to our chosen actions in response to environmental cues ( ). \n\n\n### Limitations of the present study \n  \nThere are several limitations to the current study. Some relate to the different results observed using the meta-analysis and within-subjects fMRI experiment. There are several potential reasons why the conjunction results were not identical across the two approaches. The first may just be type II error. However, the different results may also relate to several key differences between the methods. The GingerALE meta-analysis software ( ) is a commonly used tool for analysing results from many separate neuroimaging studies (e.g.  ,  ). The advantages of a meta-analysis include an increase in the number of subjects, and thereby statistical power to detect an effect, above and beyond what is possible in a typical fMRI study. However, there is anatomical variance across subjects and across studies, limiting the interpretation of foci co-localisation from different tasks. There is greater smoothing of the underlying signal with GingerALE than in our fMRI study, reducing spatial resolution in the meta-analysis results. The anatomical accuracy of the meta-analysis foci is also limited by the inclusion of studies using PET, which has lower anatomical precision than fMRI. In addition, across the meta-analysis and within-subjects fMRI study, there will have been subtle differences in stimuli presentation or required motor response, potentially contributing to different findings across the two methods. The within-subjects selection and stopping experiment allowed us to address some of the issues of anatomical accuracy, but has lower power than the meta-analysis. \n\nWith regard to our second question of why selection and stopping might show similar regional activations, the null behavioural result and significant negative fMRI interaction (under-additive activation) require caution in inference: however small the absolute effect size, one cannot infer that there was no behavioral effect at all. Further work is therefore required to characterise the mechanisms underlying the relationship between selection and stopping in the preSMA, including perhaps the combination of brain imaging with precisely timed perturbations such as TMS. \n\nImaging the subthalamic nucleus is of particular relevance to stop signal tasks ( ,  ,  ), as the preSMA is proposed to influence the subthalamic nucleus during response inhibition ( ,  ,  ). However, the subthalamic nucleus is a small oblique ovoid structure, which may be poorly visualised in a whole-brain imaging with relatively large voxels and spatial smoothing. Higher resolution imaging and probabilistic mapping may be more sensitive to the subthalamic nucleus in future studies ( ). In addition, higher resolution imaging may be of benefit in applying analysis techniques such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA,  ) to disentangle separate neuronal populations within brain regions. Finally, our analysis is restricted to regional activations. Future studies of effective connectivity would be of interest in order to quantify the interactions within the networks for selection and stopping, including the interactions between inferior frontal gyrus and preSMA (cf.  ,  ), and building on structure\u2013function correlations for stopping efficiency emerging from the analysis of white matter tract structure ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn both a meta-analysis and a combined selection and stopping fMRI task, we found that selection and stopping co-localise to the preSMA. However, activation of the preSMA was similar whether stopping specified actions, stopping selected actions, or executing selected actions. Moreover, the stop signal reaction times were similar whether subjects stopped specified or selected actions. We suggest that the preSMA supports the representation of competing responses, in such a way that does not require shared access to a single inhibitory mechanism, in order to resolve conflict between action representations. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by the   (MC-A060-5PQ30 and a Doctoral Training Award to CLR), the   (088324 to JBR, LEH), the  , the   (CW) and the  . \n\n Conflict of interest  \n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3898966,"text_md5":"9485b718b55dd4fa148d97d8478954f9","field_positions":{"authors":[0,101],"journal":[102,112],"publication_year":[114,118],"title":[129,213],"keywords":[227,516],"abstract":[529,2182],"body":[2191,54550]},"batch":1,"pmid":24128740,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2013.10.012","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3898966","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3898966"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3898966\">3898966<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3898966  Selection and stopping in voluntary action: A meta-analysis and combined fMRI study\u2606"}

Voxelwise meta-analysis was performed using signed differential mapping. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe findings from 55 fMRI studies on MND were tabulated, and some common findings were discussed in further details. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese findings are preliminary, sometimes even contradictory, and do not allow a complete understanding of the functional alterations in MND. However, we documented reliable findings that MND is not confined to the motor system, but is a multisystem disorder involving extra-motor cortex areas, causing cognitive dysfunction and deficits in socioemotional and sensory processing pathways. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMotor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily involving the motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form, characterized by involvement of both upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN), with a median survival time of 2\u20134\u2009years from onset of symptoms in population-based studies ( ). Other phenotypes of MND include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, UMN affected only), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA, LMN affected only), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP, motor nuclei of pons and medulla affected mainly) and some special forms, such as flail arm or flail leg ( ). The cause of MND remains largely unknown, but there is an increasing awareness that the neurodegeneration of MND is not only restricted to the motor system but also involves sensory, language, behavior and other cognitive fields. In fact, up to 50% of patients with ALS have cognitive deficits, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to overt frontotemporal dementia (FTD) ( ). \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study functional changes of the brain in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including MND, since it provides high-resolution, non-invasive estimates of neural activity. The most common approach in fMRI, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI is based on the assumption that when a neural event occurs, extraction fraction of oxygen from the local microvasculature leads to a decreased of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the activated region. Changes from diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin to paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin that take place with the neural event leads to an alteration in T2*-weighted MRI signals. Acquisition of BOLD signals can be combined with specific tasks to perform task-associated fMRI studies, and background patterns of regional activity in the \u201cresting state\u201d can be studied, which is called the resting state-fMRI (RS-fMRI). The broad availability of fMRI with a multitude of motor and extra-motor paradigms has contributed to a great increase in scientific publications on functional studies in MND over the last decade ( ). \n\nUnderstanding patterns of functional activity in patients with MND could provide important insights on the pathophysiology of this fatal disease, as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. An independent meta-analysis is a powerful strategy to combine and summarize the data of interest and potentially offers insights that are not apparent from the individual studies. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and voxelwise meta-analysis of studies comparing brain activity in patients with MND and in healthy controls (HCs) to identify common findings across studies. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search Methods \n  \nOvid Medline, Pubmed, and Emabase databases were searched for studies published up to April 2015 that reported functional MRI data in patients with MND. Search terms included \u201cmotor neuron disease,\u201d \u201cMND,\u201d \u201camyotrophic lateral sclerosis,\u201d \u201cALS,\u201d and these terms were combined using the AND operator with \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging,\u201d \u201cfunctional MRI,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cblood oxygenation level dependent,\u201d \u201cBOLD,\u201d \u201cresting state,\u201d and \u201cconnectivity.\u201d Both text word and MeSH subject headings were used. Language was confined to English or Chinese, and reviews were excluded in the advanced search. The search strategy was supplemented by inspecting the reference lists of included articles. \n\n\n### Inclusion Criteria \n  \nTo be included in the systematic review, studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) observational study conducted in patients with MND, (2) comparison group of HCs, and (3) subjects were evaluated by fMRI. Articles were excluded if they were case reports or non-human subjects were involved. When the same study population was reported in more than one article, the data were included only once. Literature was evaluated by two independent researchers at the same time, and conflicts were resolved by a third party after discussion of each article. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nFor each study, following data for participants were extracted: mean age, mean disease duration, and mean revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) scores. Details of the paradigm of task-associated fMRI were recorded, which were divided into motor tasks (including movement execution, imagery or observation) and extra-motor tasks. The analysis methods of RS-fMRI and combined imaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or voxel-based morphometry (VBM), were also extracted. Our major concerns were the activation or connectivity changes of MND patients compared with HCs. \n\n\n### Voxelwise Meta-Analysis \n  \nVoxelwise meta-analysis was performed using the signed differential mapping (SDM) software (version 4.31,  ), which combines various positive features of earlier methods, such as activation likelihood estimation and multilevel kernel density analysis ( ). The SDM methods have been described in details elsewhere ( ,  ). Articles were selected for voxelwise meta-analysis if (1) voxel-based comparisons were made at the whole-brain level between patients with MND and HCs and (2) differences in voxel signal intensity between patients and controls were reported in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and studies were excluded if they used seed-based or region of interest (ROI)-based correlation analysis. The MND vs. HC contrasts to different stimuli or at rest were chosen as individual SDM analyses: (1) MND vs. HC to motor stimuli, (2) MND vs. HC to extra-motor stimuli, and (3) MND vs. HC at rest. Two researchers independently extracted activation foci from included studies, and a disagreement was ruled by a third party after discussions. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was set at 20\u2009mm, which had excellent control for false positives according to previous studies; and the statistical threshold was set to be a   P  -value <0.005 without correction for false discovery rate (FDR), which was found to be able to optimize the balance between sensitivity and specificity ( ). Mean analysis and Jackknife sensitivity analysis were carried out. The last analysis was a meta-regression of voxel values across the studies by the ALSFRS-R scores of the patients\u2019 samples. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included Papers \n  \nA total of 416 articles were retrieved. After removal of duplicate entries, 239 articles remained and then underwent screening according to title and abstract, resulting 180 being excluded because (1) the study focused on disorders other than MND, or (2) the study is an animal experiment or a case report, or (3) the study did not involve fMRI. After full-text review, another four papers were excluded due to lack of a HC group or a clear description of between-group differences. Eventually a total of 55 papers were included in the systematic review, including 18 task-associated fMRI studies using motor paradigms ( \u2013 ), 12 studies using extra-motor paradigms ( \u2013 ) and 25 RS-fMRI studies ( \u2013 ) (Tables  \u2013 ). Twelve research groups ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) reported more than one article that we could not identify whether their data were derived from the same patients sample or not; however, because different tasks or analytical methods were used, results of all of these articles are presented in the systematic review.

The reported mean disease duration of 35 studies was 28\u2009months (ranging from 14 to 104). The reported mean ALSFRS-R scores of 36 studies was 36.5 (ranging from 27.4 to 41.5). Only nine studies reported that patients were taking riluzole during the examination ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The El Escorial or Revised El Escorial was commonly used as the standardized diagnostic measure. All studies included a comparison between MND patient group and HC group; besides, five of the studies included an additional comparison group, including patients with peripheral lesions, Kennedy syndrome, tetraplegia, LMN affection and FTD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Task-Associated fMRI Studies in MND Patients \n  \n\n### Task Design \n  \nThe experimental paradigms can be divided into block design and event-related (ER) design according to the presentation of the stimuli. Traditional fMRI experiments usually adopt a block design, which consists of two different experimental conditions, namely on (task block) and off (control block) conditions. These two conditions appear alternately in the form of square wave. Signal increases with repeated stimulation due to overlap of \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d conditions. Block design has the advantage of producing large signal change and thus high statistical power. However, its accumulated effect may produce a large number of false signals and cause a fatigue effect on the participants psychologically. In 1996, Buckner came up with the concept of ER design, or single trial design. In this method, stimulation signals appear as pulses, and there is a time interval between each signal. ER design has a better temporal information regarding response to individual trials and analysis can be restricted to   post hoc   categorization of responses, but it may yield insufficient signal to noise and thus loss of statistical power. In comparison, block design is preferred for detection of activation and ER design is preferred for estimation of hemodynamic response function. In this systematic review, one motor task-associated study ( ) and four extra-motor task-associated studies ( ,  ,  ,  ) utilized an ER design, and all other studies used a block design. \n\n#### Motor Paradigms \n  \nTwelve studies ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) utilized the task of limb movement execution, usually the right hand, including finger flexion, finger tapping, button presses, moving a joystick and squeezing a ball (Table  ). In comparison with HCs, ALS patients have shown enhanced bihemispheric activation in the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor areas (SMA) and cingulate areas ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), more activated in cerebral regions involved in motor learning (cerebellum, brain stem and basal ganglia, especially putamen) ( ,  ,  ,  ), and increased recruitment of extra-motor areas [temporal and parietal cortices, primary sensor cortex (S1)] ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). A pattern change and an activity shift to more anterior premotor areas in MND were also observed ( ,  ,  ). Furthermore, within the primary sensorimotor cortices there was an alteration in somatotopy, but only in ALS patients with both UMN and LMN affected ( ), or UMN only ( ). One study compared the activation pattern within the ALS group and found that patients with greater UMN involvement had more robust activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right caudate nucleus than patients with greater LMN involvement. Three studies found reduced activation during motor tasks in MND compared to HCs, and these areas mostly centered on the contralateral M1, SMA, parietal, and prefrontal cortex ( ,  ,  ). \n\nFindings from four studies ( ,  ,  ,  ) supported that altered brain activation during motor tasks correlated with the amount of UMN involvement. Two studies revealed that when physical impairments got worse in ALS, the activity in the contralateral M1 decreased accordingly ( ,  ). In another study, the hypoactivated areas matched with foci of cortical atrophy demonstrated by VBM studies in ALS patients, mainly in primary sensory motor cortex and frontal dorsal PMC ( ). At last, patients with faster disease progression had lower activation of extra-motor areas during motor tasks over 1\u2009year than patients with slower disease progression ( ). \n\nA different pattern of cortical activity during limb movement imagery or observation was seen in ALS compared to motor execution tasks, though these tasks involve similar areas. Four studies adopted the task of right-hand movement imagery ( ,  ,  ,  ). Compared to HCs, ALS patients had increased activity within the M1 and PMC, and decreased activity within the subcortical (e.g., putamen and ACC) and cortical (e.g., hippocampus, left inferior parietal, and medial prefrontal cortex.) structures related to motor memory. Four studies adopted the task of movement observation but revealed contradictory results: two of which found hyperactivation in the PMC and inferior parietal gyrus ( ,  ), and the other two studies found hypoactivation in the PMC and inferior frontal gyrus ( ,  ). \n\nDuring tongue movements, the cortical activation pattern in ALS patients without bulbar signs did not differ from HCs. Three studies comparing the activation patterns of ALS patients with bulbar signs and HCs found consistently reduced activity in the M1 and S1 ( ,  ,  ). Furthermore, ALS patients without dysphagia showed increased activity in bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri than patients with dysphagia, with additional activation in left thalamus ( ). Also, ALSFRS-R score was positively correlated with the signal change in tongue area during tongue movements ( ). \n\n\n#### Extra-Motor Paradigms \n  \nSeven studies ( ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ) employed language or executive tasks (Table  ). In two studies ( ,  ) using letter fluency tasks, it was found that impaired activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri, ACC, and parietal and temporal cortices was associated with reduced verbal fluency in MND. Inhibitory control, which is the core of execution, has been investigated in five studies ( ,  ,  \u2013 ), including Stroop and negative priming tasks, antisaccade and prosaccade tasks, go-stop tasks, go\/no-go tasks, and reversal learning tasks. An increased cerebral activation accompanying the performance of the Stroop effect and reduced activation during the negative priming comparison was observed, with most of the altered areas on the left hemisphere ( ). The study adopting antisaccade and prosaccade trials revealed enhanced activation in supplementary eye fields and frontal eye fields, and reductions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity ( ). When performing go-stop tasks, patients with ALS had stronger inhibition-related activity in the frontal gyrus, putamen, and pallidum, and stronger execution-related activity in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex ( ). In another study, patients\u2019 motor activation was higher than HCs when performed go\/no-go tasks during the initial measurement, and declined during the 3-month interval; in contrast, the patients\u2019 novelty-evoked hippocampal activity increased across 3\u2009months ( ). At last, the orbitofrontal activity of an ALS patient with impairment on neuropsychological tests and behavioral disturbance was more bilateral and more spatially extensive than controls when performing a probabilistic reversal learning task, while the other patient without behavioral dysfunction did not show these alterations ( ). \n\nThree studies ( ,  ,  ) investigated the processing of socioemotional stimuli in patients with ALS who do not have dementia, adopting the tasks of receiving socioemotional stimuli from the International Affective Picture System, emotional attribution tasks and identifying the emotional faces as the \u201ctarget\u201d one, respectively. In ALS, areas with hyperactivity compared to HCs included the right supramarginal area, ACC and bilateral DLPFC ( ,  ), and these differences in processing of social information increased over the course of 6\u2009months. The activity in the right-sided frontal areas during processing of aversive emotional stimuli was reduced ( ). Another study utilizing a socioeconomic game called \u201ctrust task,\u201d which elicited specific patterns of activation along the frontal structure and cingulate gyrus, revealed abnormal alterations of neural activity in the cingulate ( ). Finally, in a paradigm where visual, auditory, and somatosensory stimuli were involved, patients with ALS demonstrated decreased response in the secondary visual, auditory and sensory integration areas, and structural damage of white matter in associative cortices were also observed through DTI ( ). \n\n\n\n### RS-fMRI Studies in MND Patients \n  \nSince it is difficult for patients with motor deficits to conduct the execution of certain tasks, RS-fMRI attracts more and more attention in the imaging studies of MND, due to its advantages of time-saving and insusceptibility to cognitive or motor impairments of patients. This method is particularly suitable for the exploration of the systematic damage in patients\u2019 brain network. Details of included studies were listed in Table  . \n\n#### Methods of RS-fMRI Analysis \n  \nWith emerging research on resting state network in MND, new analysis techniques are being explored and discovered. Here we provide a brief overview of each analytic method used in the reviewed studies. \n\nFunctional connectivity (FC) is evaluated as a measure of the temporal coherence in the functional signal across different regions of the brain. This is generally achieved through seed region-based FC (SRFC) or independent component analysis (ICA). In SRFC, also called ROI analysis, a specific anatomical ROI is selected as the seed region and then a FC map is depicted by detecting temporal correlation between that seed and all other areas in the brain, but the network activity not associated with the ROI will not be detected; thus, this approach might introduce potential biases in evaluation and does not allow a global view of the brain connectivity ( ). On the other hand, the ICA approach is more complex as it evaluates the entire brain and decomposes it into multiple independent components, each depicted as a functional map ( ). ICA is a data-driven approach without any predefined ROI. Slightly different from ICA, a structural imaging-derived network-guided component analysis was proposed by Douaud et al. ( ). Combined with DTI, this tractography-derived FC analysis method allows the integration of structural and FC information. \n\nGraph theory and complex network analysis, which is derived from the former, are a mathematical representation of a real-world complex system, modeled as a set of discrete regions or nodes linked by edges ( ). Nodes in large-scale brain networks usually represent specific brain regions, while edges or links represent anatomical, functional or effective connectedness. Unlike graph theory, complex network analysis primarily deals with real-life networks that are larger and more complex, which has been used to detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to impairments ( ). \n\nAmplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) measures the intensity of spontaneous changes within the lower frequency range of the BOLD signals (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz), and the power spectrum of BOLD signals is used to calculate correlations to estimate the degree of FC among voxels ( ). However, it has been indicated that ALFF is sensitive to the physiological noise, so a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach is proposed, in which the power spectrum of low frequency is normalized by that of the entire frequency range before statistical comparisons ( ). The fALFF method improves the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. \n\nRegional homogeneity (ReHo) is also a data-driven approach that uses Kendall\u2019s Correlation Coefficient to measure the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of adjacent voxels in a voxelwise way, and thus a temporal activation map is achieved ( ). Greater ReHo values indicate greater FC. However, ReHo depends on the synchronous activities of neighboring voxels, limiting its usage only to study functional connections among anatomically adjacent areas. \n\nVoxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) is a computer-based procedure that quantifies FC between each voxel in one hemisphere and its mirrored counterpart on the other hemisphere, based on the theory that the endogenous spontaneous activity of neurons derived from identical sites on opposite sides of the brain has a high similarity, namely homotopy function. \n\n\n#### Network and Connectivity Changes \n  \nFive studies used the SRFC method, alone or in combination, and several brain areas were chosen as the ROI: primary sensorimotor cortex, M1 or Brodmann (BA) 4 area, SMA, basal ganglia, and cerebellum ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In the study of Agosta et al. ( ), increased FC between the left primary sensorimotor cortex and the right cingulated cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum-crus II were observed; no FC changes of the right primary sensorimotor cortex were found. Using M1 or BA 4 area as a seed, two studies ( ,  ) yielded different results: Machts et al. found increased FC of the right M1 with the SMA, precentral, and postcentral gyrus, and decreased FC of the right M1 with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), frontal pole, lateral parietal cortex and inferior temporal cortex; while there were no significant results in the study of Casseb et al. Fekete et al. ( ) found widespread FC alterations in motor network, including regions not obviously clinically affected, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The study of Roll et al. ( ) revealed enhanced FC in all networks except for the reference network and that the hyperconnectivity pattern extended spatially into adjacent brain structures toward more frontal portions. \n\nThe ICA approach and its modified version were used in seven studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), and network with altered FC in ALS compared to HCs primarily included the default-mode network (DMN), the sensorimotor network (SMN), and the frontoparietal network (FPN). Distinct differences of the DMN were found when comparing ALS patients with HCs, with increased FC in two studies (frontal and temporal regions, left precuneus) ( ,  ), decreased FC in three studies ( ,  ,  ) (ventral ACC, PCC, bilateral inferior parietal cortex patients, and right inferior orbitofrontal gyrus) and no FC changes in one study ( ). Four studies demonstrated reduced FC in the SMN ( ,  ,  ,  ), and the alterations mainly centered on the M1 and PMC, while one study revealed increase of FC in the primary sensorimotor cortex and PMC ( ). As for the right FPN (R-FPN), suppressed RS-fMRI signals in the superior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, left anterior insula\/inferior frontal cortex were found in three studies ( ,  ,  ), and increased connectivity of the right angular gyrus was observed in one study ( ). One study reported increased FC of the left inferior parietal lobule and left middle cingulum in the left RPN (L-RPN) ( ). One study demonstrated alterations in RS-fMRI signals of the executive network (left middle frontal cortex) and salience network (medial prefrontal cortex and insula) ( ), while another study found no significant changes in these two networks ( ). One study compared the resting state network of HCs and patients with PLS using ICA, and the results showed increased FC in the SMN, L-FPN, and the frontal network, and no significant alterations were found in the DMN and R-FPN ( ). \n\nBrain network topology was assessed through graph theoretical approaches or complex network analysis in nine studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ). Seven studies revealed findings on motor cortex, motor network or motor-related areas, focusing on different aspects ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Loewe et al. ( ) found decreased FC in motor-related areas include bilateral pre- and postcentral gyrus; Zhou et al. ( ) found that ALS patients showed altered pairwise FC in 11 out of 18 node pairs chosen from the motor network, both decreased and increased. Further findings from Schmidt et al. ( ) indicated that direct connections of motor cortex are both structurally and functionally more affected than connections at greater topological distance from the motor cortex. Fekete et al. ( ) discovered reduced subcortical\u2013cortical motor connectivity and increased connectivity within the subcortical motor networks and Buchanan et al. ( ) also provided evidence that the motor-frontal-subcortical subnetwork of ALS patients was impaired, involving four nodes within the M1, left superior frontal, left-posterior cingulate and four subcortical areas (bilateral pallidum, left thalamus, left caudate). In the study of Jelsone-Swain et al. ( ), overall systemic decrease in FC between the right and left motor cortices in ALS with limb-onset was observed, with a pronounced disconnection between dorsal ROI pairs of the M1. Only the study of Verstraete et al. ( ) revealed unchanged functional organization of the motor network. Two studies demonstrated altered connectivity in regions other than the motor network. Heimrath et al. ( ) discovered increased FC in the parahippocampal and parietal areas of DMN, and Meoded et al. ( ) found 12 regions with increased FC with a predominance of cerebrocerebellar connections. \n\nTwo studies using the analysis of ALFF or fALFF showed that, compared with the controls, the ALS patients demonstrated significantly decreased ALFF values in the visual cortex, fusiform gyri and right postcentral gyrus, and significantly increased ALFF values in the left medial frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal areas after gray matter correction ( ); and that alterations of motor FC in ALS coincided with altered local fluctuation amplitudes in the M1 and cerebellum independent of the clinical severity ( ). \n\nOnly one study from the available literature used the analysis of ReHo and one study used VMHC. Researchers found region-dependent ReHo value changes (increase and decrease) in the region of the S1, M1, and PMC ( ). And higher VMHC coefficients in the SMA, superior frontal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, lower VMHV coefficients in M1, S1, inferior parietal lobule, cuneus\/precuneus, and ACC were discovered ( ). \n\n\n\n### Voxelwise Meta-Analysis \n  \nA total of 30 studies provided coordinates where significant differences between patients with MND and controls were identified. The number of studies employing tongue movement task was too small to conduct a voxelwise meta-analysis. Ten limb movement task-associated studies were divided into right-hand movement execution and right-hand movement imagery or observation. Among the nine extra-motor task-associated studies, only two studies adopted the same task, the letter fluency task, but still, the number of the coordinates was too small to combine. The comparisons in two of the eight included RS-fMRI studies were not made at the whole-brain level, so they were ruled out. Technique details of the remaining 16 studies are presented in Table  . The main results were illustrated in Figure  . \n  \n Technique details of studies included into the voxelwise meta-analysis  . \n  \n AFNI, analysis of functional neuroimages; FDR, false discovery rate; FWE, family-wise error; FHWH, full-width half maximum; FSL, FMRIB Software Library; NA, not available; SPM, Statistical Parametric Mapping; T, Tesla  . \n    \n Brain response abnormalities in motor neuron disease (MND) compared with healthy controls (HCs)  . Areas with increased activity relative to controls are displayed in red, and areas with decreased activity are displayed in blue. In the meta-analyses, compared with HCs, patients with MND had significant hyperactivity in the left postcentral gyrus and right precentral gyrus, and hypoactivity in the left precentral gyrus during right-hand movement execution   (A)  ; hyperactivity in the right postcentral gyrus during right-hand movement imagery or observation   (B)  ; and hypoactivity in the bilateral precentral gyrus at rest   (C)  . \n  \n#### Changes in Brain Response to Right-Hand Movement Execution \n  \nAs shown in Table   and Figure  A, compared with HCs, patients with ALS had hyperactivity in the left postcentral gyrus (BA 3), corpus callosum, right precentral gyrus (BA 4) and left striatum, and had hypoactivity in the left precentral gyrus (BA 6) during right-hand movement execution. In Jackknife sensitivity analysis, the software repeated the mean analysis several times, each time including all the studies but one to test the replicability of the result. However, we noted that in the sensitivity analysis, hyperactivity in the corpus callosum was reported in only three studies; therefore, we conservatively did not consider it as a significant finding. We performed a meta-regression analysis for the ALSFRS-R score and found that it was positively associated with activation in the corpus callosum (MNI coordinate: 10, \u22128, 58, SDM-Z 3.354,   P  \u2009=\u20090.000330269, no. of voxels 170). \n  \n Brain response abnormalities in ALS compared to HCs in task of right-hand movement execution  . \n  \n ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BA, Brodmann; HC, healthy control; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping; SMA, supplementary motor area  . \n  \n\n#### Changes in Brain Response to Right-Hand Movement Imagery or Observation \n  \nAs shown in Table   and Figure  B, compared with HCs, patients with ALS had hyperactivity in the right postcentral gyrus (BA 4), left superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral, BA 6), and right insula (BA 48), and no hypoactivity was found during right-hand movement imagery or observation in the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the results changed remarkably in the following Jackknife analysis, with the highest replicability being only three out of five, which meant the robustness, specifically the sensitivity, was not very good. In the meta-regression analysis, ALSFRS-R was negatively associated with activation in the right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (MNI coordinate: 6, 12, 42, SDM-Z \u22122.066,   P  \u2009=\u20090.000252903, no. of voxels 556). Considering the high heterogeneity of the included studies, statistical significance of this meta-regression should be taken with caution. \n  \n Brain response abnormalities in ALS compared to HCs in task of right-hand movement imagery or observation  . \n  \n ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BA, Brodmann; HC, healthy control; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping  . \n  \n\n#### Changes in Brain Response at Rest \n  \nAs shown in Table   and Figure  C, compared with HCs, patients with MND had hypoactivity in the right precentral gyrus (BA 4) and left precentral gyrus (BA 6), and no hyperactivity was found at rest. The whole brain Jackknife sensitivity analysis indicated activation reductions in precentral gyrus on both sides were moderately replicable because they were preserved four out of the six combinations. The meta-regression analysis showed ALSFRS-R score was negatively associated with activation in the right angular gyrus (MNI coordinate: 54, \u221252, 30, SDM-Z \u22122.6,   P  \u2009=\u20090.000629604, no. of voxels 1127). \n  \n Brain response abnormalities in ALS compared to HCs at rest  . \n  \n ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BA, Brodmann; HC, healthy control; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping  . \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe use of fMRI in MND research is relatively new; however, the number of published studies grows steadily with the ultimate goals of improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of this disorder as well as the identification of biomarkers of MND progression. Thus, the literature has uncovered a wide array of brain regions that exhibit group differences between MND patients and HCs. Despite the variability across included studies with respect to study designs and analytic approaches, a number of consistencies emerged and demonstrated similar findings to the PET literature that has been reviewed elsewhere ( ). \n\n### Implications of the Main Findings \n  \n#### Motor Paradigms \n  \nWe observed an enhanced activation in motor areas during movement in patients with ALS, including the bilateral M1, PMC, and SMA in early stages, along with additional recruitment of cerebral regions for higher order motor processing, determined by motor neuron involvement (especially UMN impairments) in the long run. Such alterations might represent a compensatory cortical plasticity, as new synapses and pathways are developed to compensate for the loss of pyramidal cells in the M1 and the reduction of local inhibitory interneuronal function ( ). An anterior shift of activity and spread to encompass the sensorimotor cortices and temporoparietal associative sensory, which has also been noted in stroke patients, other neurodegenerative disorders and the aging brain, lend support to this theory ( ). The striatal pattern of activation indicate that ALS patients need to recruit basal ganglia system to complete simple finger movement tasks, compared to that this system is normally recruited in more complex motor behaviors in controls. This difference is interpreted as a pattern of functional adaptation to the corticospinal tract dysfunction, suggesting ALS patients may also recruit existing neuronal pathways to compensate for neuronal loss of the primary motor region ( ). However, the compensation is not unlimited. A longitudinal fMRI study found two distinct stages of neuroplastic changes when comparing the motor activations in three groups of ALS patients with different degrees of weakness: first, an increase of the activated area in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex irrespective of the degree of weakness; second, reduction of signal change and beta weights with increasing weakness ( ). The fact that the size of the activated cluster did not change between the ALS groups suggested the spread of activation due to loss of intracortical inhibition would reach a ceiling early in the disease, and the reduction of signal change and beta weights was a consequence of ongoing loss of UMN ( ). \n\nThe different activation pattern of movement imagery might be an indication of disruption of the normal networks associated with motor imagery ( ). The decrease of activation in ALS patients with bulbar signs when performing voluntary saliva swallow or tongue vertical movements stands in prominent contrast to the increase of activity observed in ALS patients when performing limb movements. Lack of compensatory capacity for bulbar movements compared with spinal movements might be one of the potential mechanisms, indicating fundamental differences in the neurodegenerative and subsequent reorganization processes for limb and bulbar movements ( ). \n\n\n#### Extra-Motor Paradigms \n  \nThrough extra-motor paradigms, fMRI data provided evidence for a multisystem involvement of cognitive, socioemotional, and sensory processing pathways in patients with MND. Decreased activation in the prefrontal areas related to fluency and confrontation naming deficits in patients with MND regardless of UMN signs has been observed, suggesting an impairment of lexical and phonological processing as well as the dysfunction of working memory ( ,  ). In studies investigating inhibitory control of ALS, in spite of the utilization of different kinds of tasks, they consistently revealed that ALS patients had difficulty in achieving response suppression ( ,  ,  ). Inhibition of automatic responses is a crucial process within the executive system, and these results suggested a direct link between a particular deficit of cognitive process and a functional impairment in the prefrontal cortex in patients with ALS. The findings that novelty-evoked hippocampal activity in the ALS group during go\/no-go task increased across 3\u2009months and that ALS patients\u2019 enhanced functional activity found in specific areas of the saccade network associated with better responses, both reflect the build-up of the compensatory processes typically observed at the beginning of neurological lesions and fit with the notion of functional compensatory plasticity following their cognitive impairments ( ,  ). \n\nFurther changes in cortical pattern activation were observed in non-demented ALS during the processing of socioemotional stimuli. When they were shown pictures of persons in emotional situations, ALS patients presented an enhanced activity in the supramarginal area on the right side, which is a part of the social information-processing pathway ( ). The elevated activity suggests an altered sensitivity to social\u2013emotional cues in ALS patients without significant cognitive impairments. Reduced activity in the right-sided frontal regions during processing of aversive emotional stimuli also corroborates the assumption of dysfunction in emotional processing network in ALS ( ). Though there is limited anatomical and clinical evidence for sensory processing deficits in ALS, it seems that the neurodegeneration involves visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortical areas as well ( ). \n\n\n#### Resting State-Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nTo date, there has been no established consensus about the best way to compare findings from studies that utilize different analytical approaches. Each method that has been described in this review produced, mostly consistent or similar results, yet in a few instances, contradictory findings as well. In general, we detected significant changes in the SMN, DMN, and FPN. The SMN has been linked to motor control and the latter two have been shown to be involved in cognitive and executive processes. The present results once again support impairments in extra-motor system in ALS. \n\nSeveral studies reported significantly reduced FC within SMN and DMN and significantly overlapping the areas of structural change, whereas other studies have identified regions of increased FC, including somatosensory and extra-motor areas. A possible explanation to the controversial changes is that in the early stage of the disease, when most function is still preserved, FC has already begun to degrade; however, with increased burden of pathology, loss of local inhibitory circuitry starts to manifest, leading to an increase of FC ( ). This concept is supported by the evidence that patients with higher disease burden had stronger network connectivity than patients who were less affected by ALS ( ). Another assumption interprets the increased FC as a compensation for the structural damage, but this increase will be exhausted with disease progression ( ). In agreement with the second hypothesis, ALS patients with preserved corticospinal tract had more widespread connectivity than those with severe damages assessed by DTI ( ). The latter hypothesis is further fostered by a significant disease-by-age interaction in the DMN, especially in the PCC, found in the ALS group, where signals correlated with age positively in patients but negatively in controls ( ). The authors think that the interaction unravels a possible mechanism of compensation between motor and extra-motor systems, emerging as a supplementary functional push to help motor disturbances ( ). The reported discrepancy probably reflects the different compositions of the patient groups, which varied in the degrees of the disease severity and therefore in different pathological stages. \n\n\n\n### Implications of the Voxelwise Meta-Analysis \n  \nFor the first time, we used quantitative SDM meta-analytic methods to synthesize findings from 16 functional neuroimaging studies of MND. Compared with an individual fMRI study, this technique is able to establish consistent fMRI data from the included studies. Results revealed reliable clusters of abnormal activation in MND within the regions comprising precentral and postcentral gyrus on both hemispheres when compared with HCs. Moreover, these altered cerebral activation map changes corresponded to atrophy detected by meta-analysis of VBM studies in ALS ( ). We also found that the symptom severity assessed by ALSFRS-R scores was associated with hypoactivity in the corpus callosum during right-hand movement and hyperactivity in the right angular gyrus at resting state. \n\nIt is noteworthy that, in the Jackknife analysis, the robustness of some regional activity changes was not very high, in some cases, tasks of right-hand movement imagery or observation for example, even down to 0. Several explanations could account for the instability. First, heterogeneity of the disease process might generate independent impacts on the brain\u2019s functional state, and movement imagery or observation in particular might represent highly heterogeneous conditions since it is very hard to quantify. Second, the heterogeneity of the methodologies in the fMRI studies, including different preprocessing protocols and analytic approaches, might also be a critical factor. Finally, the number of eligible studies was relatively small and findings in the original studies were less likely to overlap at the voxel level to reach sufficient statistical power to demonstrate concordant results. \n\nMeanwhile, the meta-analysis is unable to answer whether the reported changes represent a tendency for the development of ALS or the consequence of the illness; thus, could not provide useful information to verify any particular mechanism. There is a need for further large developmental studies that examine the association between brain function alterations and symptom onset longitudinally to fully answer this question. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe reviewed studies have several limitations. The main limitation lies in the variation of the studied population, which differed largely in disease duration and severity. Another important source of bias may be the effect of medication. Some articles reported their patients of the sample were receiving riluzole while others did not mention; however, riluzole is known to increase intracortical inhibition and therefore interfere with the BOLD signals according to a previous study ( ). As for the voxelwise meta-analysis, though it is able to provide an excellent control of false positives, it is difficult to completely avoid false-negative results ( ). The breakdown of a cluster should not be understood as \u201call these areas are abnormal\u201d but as \u201cone or more of these areas are abnormal,\u201d because normal brain regions close to those abnormalities might appear to be abnormal artificially. Furthermore, this approach is based on pooling of summarized coordinates rather than raw statistical brain maps, which may result in less accuracy ( ). Meanwhile, the sample size of our included studies is relatively small, which limits the generalization of the results. These limitations, along with the methodological differences, make the interpretation of the final analysis difficult. As recently recommended ( ), future studies should include sufficient numbers of MND patients in different disease stages to provide better insight into changes of cerebral function and their relation with the disease process. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings are preliminary, sometimes even contradictory, and do not allow a complete and thorough understanding of the functional alterations in MND. However, the current evidence sufficiently suggests that abnormal activation in motor areas including the bilateral M1 and the SMN contribute to the pathophysiology of the illness, which is also verified by the results of SDM meta-analysis and that patients might recruit other regions to compensate the structural damages. We also documented reliable findings that ALS is not confined to the motor system, but is a multisystem disorder involving extra-motor cortex areas, causing dysfunction in cognition and deficits in socioemotional and sensory processing pathways. Future studies will benefit from larger and more homogenous cohorts, and standard models for comparison between different analytic methods. Longitudinal fMRI studies tracking patients from disease onset and continuous follow-up are also worthwhile. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4656846,"text_md5":"5f5970b7a333235bdc425ff516857104","field_positions":{"authors":[0,86],"journal":[87,99],"publication_year":[101,105],"title":[116,213],"keywords":[227,315],"abstract":[328,1392],"body":[1401,47899]},"batch":1,"pmid":26635722,"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2015.00246","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4656846","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4656846"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4656846\">4656846<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4656846  A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Functional MRI Investigation of Motor Neuron Disease"}

Psychotherapy is an effective method for easing the psychological suffering experienced also by the various impacts of COVID-19. This treatment can be examined from a neurological perspective, through the application of brain imaging techniques. Specifically, the meta-analysis of imaging studies can aid in expanding researchers' understanding of the many beneficial applications of psychotherapy. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nWe examined the functional brain changes accompanying different mental disorders with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), through a meta-analysis, and systematic review in order to better understand the general neural mechanism involved in psychotherapy and the potential neural difference between psychodynamic and non-psychodynamic approaches. \n\n\n## Data sources \n  \nThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were employed for our systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a computer-based literature search, following the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) approach, to retrieve all published articles in English regarding the above-described topics from PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science. \n\n\n## Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions \n  \nWe combined terms related to psychotherapy and fMRI: (\u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [MeSH Terms] OR \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapies\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapy s\u201d [All Fields]) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH Terms]) OR (\u201cmagnetic\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cresonance\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cimaging\u201d[All Fields]) OR (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201cfmri\u201d[All Fields]). We considered (1) whole brain fMRI studies; (2) studies in which participants have been involved in a clinical trial with psychotherapy sessions, with pre\/post fMRI; (3) fMRI results presented in coordinate-based (x, y, and z) in MNI or Talairach space; (4) presence of neuropsychiatric patients. The exclusion criteria were: (1) systematic review or meta-analysis; (2) behavioral study; (3) single-case MRI or fMRI study; and (4) other imaging techniques (i.e., PET, SPECT) or EEG. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nAfter duplicates removal and assessment of the content of each published study, we included 38 sources. The map including all studies that assessed longitudinal differences in brain activity showed two homogeneous clusters in the left inferior frontal gyrus, and caudally involving the anterior insular cortex (  p   < 0.0001, corr.). Similarly, studies that assessed psychotherapy-related longitudinal changes using emotional or cognitive tasks (TASK map) showed a left-sided homogeneity in the anterior insula (  p   < 0.000) extending to Broca's area of the inferior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.0001) and the superior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.0001). Studies that applied psychodynamic psychotherapy showed Family-Wise Error (FWE) cluster-corrected (  p   < 0.05) homogeneity values in the right superior and inferior frontal gyri, with a small cluster in the putamen. No FWE-corrected homogeneity foci were observed for Mindful- based and cognitive behavioral therapy psychotherapy. In both pre- and post-therapy results, studies showed two bilateral clusters in the dorsal anterior insulae (  p   = 0.00001 and   p   = 0.00003, respectively) and involvement of the medial superior frontal gyrus (  p   = 0.0002). \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSubjective experiences, such as an individual's response to therapy, are intrinsically challenging to quantify as objective, factual realities. Brain changes observed both pre- and post-therapy could be related to other factors, not necessary to the specific treatment received. Therapeutic modalities and study designs are generally heterogeneous. Differences exist in sample characteristics, such as the specificity of the disorder and number and duration of sessions. Moreover, the sample size is relatively small, particularly due to the paucity of studies in this field and the little contribution of PDT. \n\n\n## Conclusions and implications of key findings \n  \nAll psychological interventions seem to influence the brain from a functional point of view, showing their efficacy from a neurological perspective. Frontal, prefrontal regions, insular cortex, superior and inferior frontal gyrus, and putamen seem involved in these neural changes, with the psychodynamic more linked to the latter three regions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMental disorders represent a significant public health concern, producing an enormous economic burden for society and great suffering for patients as well as their families and communities. After almost 3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation has worsened, creating increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators,  ). \n\nAlthough the biopsychosocial model is shared by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning (WHO ICF), the previous biomedical model of mental disorders is nowadays anachronistic but still pervasive, with supporters among clinicians and researchers, thereby threatening the understanding of highly complex phenomena, such as the human mental suffering. In addition to a more complex etiopathogenesis of mental disorders supported by the biopsychosocial model, compared to the biomedical model, a more complex approach to therapy also exists. Among the major criticisms of the biomedical model, especially related to mental disorders, its reductive view of etiopathogenesis and approach to therapy are the most important concerns. \n\nPre-COVID studies have shown that at least one person out of two (50% of the high-income countries' population) will be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in their life (Wittchen et al.,  ), most commonly anxiety and depressive disorders. Antidepressants are currently among the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide, being taken by more than 10% of the general population annually in high-income countries (Jorm et al.,  ; Furukawa et al.,  ). More patients every year are on longer-term anti-depressant treatment. In the US, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed an increase of almost 30% of patients who had been using antidepressants for more than 5 years, from 13% in 1996, to 44% in 2015 (Jorm et al.,  ; Luo et al.,  ). Still in the US, we observed an increase of 21% in the number of antidepressant prescriptions in February and March 2020, the highest point since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic (America's State of Mind Report,  ). \n\nThis paper is neither about the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, nor the efficacy of psychotherapy, or the comparison between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, but a brief introduction can be helpful to establish the urgency of this topic described by our current work and the necessity of studies able to explore the effects of psychological therapies, from a behavioral and neurological point of view, especially in a post-pandemic era, in which society is experiencing   a new psychological and psychiatric pandemic  . \n\n\n## Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy \n  \nTaking into consideration only the most widespread source of mental suffering, with its pharmacological treatment, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA; Turner et al.,  ), the efficacy of antidepressant drugs for depression is quite small, with an effect size of 0.26 for Fluoxetine and Sertraline, 0.24 Citalopram, 0.31 for Escitalopram, 0.30 for Duloxetine, and with an overall effect size of FDA approved antidepressant drugs between 1987 and 2004 of 0.31. Other more recent studies have shown that antidepressant medications achieve effect sizes of between 0.24 (tricyclics) and 0.31 in case of SSRIs (Kirsch et al.,  ). When Kirsch et al. ( ) have used published and unpublished Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration trials, to assess antidepressant efficacy, they found that antidepressants were not clinically significant for mild, moderate, and severe depression, with a mean drug\u2013placebo difference of only 1.80 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Some studies suggest there are medications less effective than a placebo (clomipramine; Cipriani et al.,  ). A more recent study (Almohammed et al.,  ) has considered changes in the quality of life over 2 years in Americans with depression who took antidepressants (any type) vs. the changes reported by those with the same diagnosis who did not use antidepressants. The study found no significant difference in the quality of life of this population. \n\nA recent review has revealed a lack of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials for anxiety disorders and few studies comparing novel treatments to existing anxiolytic agents, concluding that although some randomized controlled trials for novel agents exist, these trials have largely been negative (Garakani et al.,  ). \n\nFurukawa et al. ( ) have recently published a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to acute treatment with a psychotherapy (PSY), a protocolized antidepressant pharmacotherapy (PHA), their combination (COM), standard treatment in primary or secondary care, or pill placebo, and were then followed up through a maintenance phase. According to this authoritative paper, psychotherapy shows more effectiveness than pharmacotherapy, both if these treatments is continued into the maintenance phase (PSY \u2192 PSY vs. PHA \u2192 PHA: OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.00\u20132.35) and if they were followed by discretionary treatment (PSY \u2192 naturalistic vs. PHA \u2192 naturalistic: OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.13\u20132.44). The same applied to PSY when compared with standard therapy through the acute and maintenance phases [PSY \u2192 PSY vs. standard treatment in primary or secondary care (STD): OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 0.97\u20133.21; PSY \u2192 nat vs. STD: OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.20\u20132.78]. In other words, PSY (and combination of PSY and PHA) has more enduring effects than PHA. Therefore, guidelines on the treatment choice for depression may need to be updated accordingly (Furukawa et al.,  ). \n\nAnother recent systematic review (Wakefield et al.,  ) confirmed the efficacy of psychotherapy, showing large pre-post treatment effect sizes for depression [  d   = 0.87, 95% CI (0.78\u20130.96),   p   < 0.0001] and anxiety [  d   = 0.88, 95% CI (0.79\u20130.97),   p   < 0.0001]. In the comparison between cognitive behavioral (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) studies and meta-analysis have shown similar efficacy (Leichsenring and Steinert,  ; Steinert et al.,  ), although some authors point out that in the case of PDT the effects last longer\u2014and even increase\u2014after the end of the treatment, with an effect size of between 0.78 and 1.46, even for diluted and truncated forms of psychoanalytic therapy (Shedler,  ; Solms,  ). A quasi-experimental comparison found psychoanalysis but not long-term PDT to be superior to CBT on measures of depression at 3-year follow-up (Huber et al.,  ). However, some authors have found a worse performance of PDT compared to CBT (Barber et al.,  ). \n\nWhen we compare PHA and PDT, some studies fail to identify differential effects (Salminen et al.,  ; Barber et al.,  ; Bloch et al.,  ; Zilcha-Mano et al.,  ). On the other hand, a recent meta-review of 61 meta-analyses covering 21 psychiatric disorders containing 852 trials and 137,126 subjects yielded larger effect sizes for PDT (0.58; 95% CI: 0.42\u20130.76) than PHA (0.40; 95% CI: 0.28\u20130.52) studies (Huhn et al.,  ). \n\nAll these studies clearly show that psychotherapy (PDT, CBT, and other psychological approaches) works, usually more effectively than PHA alone, and it works by modifying patients' symptoms, thinking patterns, beliefs, attitudes, emotional states, and behaviors, in the most widespread mental disorders, showing a good effect size, in general and compared to pharmacotherapy. Based on these results, it should be a priority of the clinical and research community to understand not if PSY works, but how this form of treatment is able to act on a neurological and neuropsychological level. Without claiming to be exhaustive, the current study uses meta-analytic and systematic review approaches to explore functional brain changes through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) among different mental disorders, trying to understand the general neural mechanism involved in psychotherapy and potential differences between changes associated with PDT and non-PDT. \n\n\n## Neural effects \n  \nAs Marek et al. ( ) have recently pointed out, most brain-wide association studies (typically based on a sample size of 25 subjects) have shown inadequacy. These authors have used a meta-analytic approach on three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available\u2014with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals, revealing how the usual brain wide association studies are not appropriate in capturing inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (Marek et al.,  ). Therefore, together with big data, a meta-analytic approach can enlarge the sample size, increase the statistical power, and give a more accurate idea about general brain changes. From a psychological (especially psychodynamic) point of view, we also note that subjectivity should be taken into consideration, given this form of therapy is highly individualized, with the   cure   passing through the therapist; thus, the subjectivity of the therapist, the patient, and their relationship, should be taken in consideration. However, since meta-analyses are not based on individuality, but on mean values, this search for objectivity has historically kept some psychoanalysts distant or skeptical toward research in general and neuroscientific research in particular. \n\nIf subjectivity is given more consideration by clinicians, therapists, and scientists involved in individual-differences level research, using a meta-analytic approach, a compromise between quantity (sample size) and quality (subjectivity) might be more reasonably reached. Such a compromise would meet the need to reinforce an already existing bridge between neuroscience and psychoanalysis, a process yearned for by psychoanalysts and neuroscientists alike over the last 20 years, and started by Freud more than a century ago (Kandel,  ,  ; Kaplan-Solms and Solms,  ; Solms and Turnbull,  ; Carhart-Harris and Friston,  ; Boeker et al.,  ; de Greck et al.,  ; Scalabrini et al.,  ; Solms,  ,  ; Cieri and Esposito,  ; Cieri et al.,  ; Northoff and Scalabrini,  ; Rabeyron,  ,  ; Cieri,  ). \n\nEffects of psychological therapies, similarly to pharmacotherapy, are capable of visualization through brain imaging methods (Kandel,  ). Meta-analytic approaches of psychotherapies can play a fundamental role understanding their neural, together with their psychological effects. This approach uses brain imaging methods to explore potential structural or functional effects of the talking cure on the brain, finding similar dysfunction in limbic structures, amygdala, hippocampus, frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and basal ganglions (S\u00f6zeri-Varma and Karada\u01e7,  ). \n\nAbbass et al. ( ) described a meta-analysis of brain imaging studies from 11 sources analyzing any form of PDT treatment. The sample was composed of 2 randomized controlled trials, 5 controlled trials and 4 case series. The patient's cohort was affected by depression (atypical and typical), borderline personality disorder, panic disorder and somatoform disorder, investigated by a variety of neuroimaging methods to examine regional metabolic activity and synaptic neurotransmission before and after treatment. These authors found a general normalization of synaptic or metabolic activity in limbic, mid-brain and prefrontal regions, occurring in association with improved clinical outcomes. Patterns of neural activity or neurophysiological infrastructure in regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala were found to vary between patients and healthy controls before the psychotherapy, while after treatment, the patterns seen in patients resembled those of the controls. \n\nMessina et al. ( ) conducted a similar meta-analytic study including 16 sources, regardless of the specific psychotherapy approach used. Different diagnosis and methods were analyzed: depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder, investigated both with resting state and task-related activation. They have also considered phobic patients through exposure-related activation method. Anxiety and depression studies showed consistent results for changes in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and in the posterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus (PCC\/Prc). Some changes were also described at the level of temporal lobes, both in anxious\/depressed and phobic patients. \n\nWe can find analogous results in similar regions coming from the systematic review by Franklin et al. ( ). They analyzed brain changes, taking in consideration 10 neuroimaging studies associated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) of depression. This specific form of psychological treatment was mostly correlated with changes in the ACC, PCC, VMPFC\/OFC, and amygdala\/hippocampus. As the authors suggest, CBT appeared to decrease the resting state activity in the dorsal ACC. Researchers involved in this study suggest that this form of treatment can develop an increased capacity for \u201ctop-down\u201d emotion regulation, which is employed when skills taught in CBT are engaged. \n\nAnother systematic review was conducted by Gotink et al. ( ) taking into consideration both the structural and functional neuronal in stress-reducing effects of the 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program. They considered 21 fMRI studies, showing that functional and structural changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex, insula, and hippocampus are similar to changes described in studies on traditional meditation practice. In addition, MBSR led to changes in the amygdala consistent with improved emotion regulation. \n\nSankar et al. ( ) focused their meta-analytic investigation on psychotherapy of major depressive disorder (MDD), measuring neural function and metabolism using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single-photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). A significant group by time effect was found in left rostral ACC, in which patients showed increased activity following psychotherapy while healthy controls showed a decrease at follow up. Longitudinal treatment effects revealed reduced left precentral cortical activity in MDD patients. Findings could be indicative of improvements in emotion responsivity that may be achieved following a psychological treatment, as suggested by the authors of this study. \n\nA more recent study comes from Thorsen et al. ( ) who conducted a systematic review and performed a meta-analysis (Seed- based d-Mapping) of 25 whole-brain neuroimaging studies using fMRI or PET comparing brain activation of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients and healthy controls during presentation of emotionally-valenced vs. neutral stimuli. OCD patients show increased emotional processing-related activation in limbic, frontal, and temporal regions, compared to healthy controls. We can observe also here similar results in similar regions described in the above mentioned studies. Particularly, patients showed increased activation in the bilateral amygdala, right putamen, OFC extending into the ACC and VMPFC, middle temporal, and left inferior occipital cortices during emotional processing. \n\n\n## Aims of the study \n  \nThe objective of this meta-analysis and systematic review was to describe the neural correlates of psychological treatments. The distinctive element of our approach derives from the fact that we sought to systematically review the functional neural effects of psychotherapy, through the fMRI, both through the resting-state (rs-fMRI), and task-fMRI approaches, trying to limit the heterogeneity of imaging's tools used. We eliminated from our study structural methods (volumetric, cortical thickness, white matters etc.) and other brain imaging approaches (PET, SPECT, MRS, etc.). We considered an initial sample of 1,378 studies, reduced to 38 with a total sample size of 1,688 subjects ( ). Another specificity of our approach is from a demographic and diagnostic point of views. We used the studies on adulthood, with an age range 18\u201365 years old, with two time points: before and after treatment; analyzing functional neural changes in major depressive disorder (MDD; 11 studies; 366 subjects), panic disorder (PD; 1 study; 27 subjects), somatoform disorder (SD; 2 studies; 120 subjects), social anxiety disorder (SAD; 5 studies; 169 subjects), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; 2 studies; 57 subjects), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 7 studies; 412 subjects), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD; 4 studies; 191 subjects), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 1 study; 40 subjects), anhedonia (1 study; 73 subjects) and schizophrenia (SZ; 4 studies; 156 subjects). Moreover, from a psychotherapeutic perspective, we tried to outline as far as possible\u2014conditioned by statistical limits deepened in the course of our work\u2014the difference between psychodynamic (PDT; 4 studies) and non-PDT approaches (34 studies). \n  \nFlow diagram for identifying studies in the systematic review. \n  \n\n## Methods \n  \nThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines has been used for our systematic review and meta-analysis (Moher et al.,  ). \n\nIn particular, our research question was specifically oriented toward functional neural changes related to psychotherapy intervention with different approaches (O) in psychologically healthy controls and psychiatric patients (P). The present review and meta-analysis was limited to longitudinal fMRI studies (I) with tasks and resting state (C). We defined the search terms based on the above mentioned PICO question combined with the Boolean operators \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cOR\u201d, according to the method previously used in other previously published systematic reviews (Cera et al.,  ; Vargas-C\u00e1ceres et al.,  ). We conducted a computer-based literature search follow the PICO approach combining terms related to psychotherapy and fMRI: (\u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [MeSH Terms] OR \u201cpsychotherapy\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapies\u201d [All Fields] OR \u201cpsychotherapy s\u201d [All Fields]) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH Terms]) OR (\u201cmagnetic\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cresonance\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cimaging\u201d[All Fields]) OR (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201cfmri\u201d[All Fields]). We conducted the computer-based literature search to retrieve all the published articles in English regarding the above-described topics. We conducted our search in the three principal databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Web of Science. \n\nImportantly, we identify fMRI studies on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: (1) whole brain fMRI studies; (2) Studies in which participants have been involved in a clinical trial with psychotherapy sessions; (3) fMRI results presented in coordinate-based (x, y, and z) in MNI or Talairach space; (4) presence of neuropsychiatric patients. The exclusion criteria were: (1) systematic review or meta-analysis; (2) behavioral study; (3) single-case MRI or fMRI study; (4) other imaging techniques (i.e., PET and SPECT) or EEG; (5) no coordinates. \n\nThe studies, which did not meet the above-mentioned criteria for the meta-analysis, will be included in our systematic review. \n\nAll of the included studies were screened to identify additional relevant bibliographic items. Similarly, the narrative, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were retrieved, and we screened them to find previous relevant articles in the reference lists. \n\nAfter the duplicate removal, the title and abstracts were manually screened to determine if they fulfilled the inclusion and\/or exclusion criteria. After the retrieval of potentially relevant studies, we read the full texts to confirm their eligibility. \n\nTwo authors conducted independently the literature search, screening, and methodological evaluation. The consensus about the different stages was reached between the two authors discussing the results and the articles retrieved. If a consensus was not reached, a third opinion was obtained. \n\nTo assess the quality of the studies included in the present systematic review, we applied the \u201cNOS-scale\u201d (Wells et al.,  ). Information has been extracted from each included study, following the above-mentioned guidelines. In particular, we extracted the characteristics of the participants, including the exclusion and inclusion criteria. \n\n\n## ALE meta-analysis of the brain clusters resulting from the included fMRI studies \n  \nTo assess the presence of a set of brain regions involved in the longitudinal above-mentioned studies, the brain coordinates reported in each included article were used for an ALE (activation likelihood estimation) meta-analysis. GingerAle 3.02 (Turkeltaub et al.,  - ) has been used to calculate the ALE meta-analysis. Indeed, GingerAle generates modeled maps of brain activations, by combining the probabilities of all brain activation foci for each voxel, as reported in the studies. Thus, the resulting maps are combined to obtain a voxel-wise ALE score. The ALE scores represent the convergence of results derived from the studies into a functional anatomical localization in the brain. The scores obtained are then compared with an empirical null distribution that represents a between\u2014studies causal association (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Moreover, all coordinates following the stereotaxic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital (MNI) have been transformed into the standardized 3D space of Talairach and Tournoux ( ) using Bioimage Suite ( ). To understand the role played by different brain regions in psychotherapy, we conducted three different ALE meta-analyses studies, with the cluster-level FWE correction (  p   < 0.01), where possible, or uncorrected statistical threshold with   p   < 0.005. According to Radua and Mataix-Cols ( ), a p threshold of 0.005 is reasonable. Moreover, to disentangle the contribution of the task-based and resting state studies, and to facilitate the interpretation of the results, a conjunction analysis has been performed using GingerALE, using a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 uncorrected. We used Mango 4.1 ( ; Lancaster et al.,  ), which allows the visualization of results obtained by navigating between the volumes of the image of an MRI template in the Talairach stereotaxic space (1988) with 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm resolution ( ). Due to no contrast T2 > T1 (or interaction effect group x time) results reported in 2 studies, 36 studies have been included in the present meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nAfter duplicates removal and the assessment of the content of each published study, we included 38 sources.   summarizes principal characteristics of the included studies in terms of demographics, the applied psychotherapy and a brief summary of the principal results as reported in each individual study. Furthermore, two authors have independently assessed the quality of the included studies applying the above-described NOS (New Castle\u2013Ottawa Scale). All the studies included   1,688   participants with a range comprised between 18 and 65, and a median of 34.6 years old. Most of the studies (  n   = 28) applied cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or non-psychodynamic, whereas specific PDT has been used in 4 studies, and specific mindfulness-based therapy in 6 sources. To assess the brain regions involved after a specific psychotherapy training, we conducted 3 different ALE meta-analyses ( ). The map including all the studies (ALL map) that assessed the longitudinal differences in brain activity, showed two homogeneous clusters in correspondence of left inferior frontal gyrus, concerning the orbitofrontal gyrus, and caudally involving the anterior portion of the insular cortex (  p   < 0.0001, corr.). Similarly, studies that assessed the longitudinal changes psychotherapy-related using emotional or cognitive tasks (TASK map) showed a left sided homogeneity in correspondence of the anterior insula (  p   < 0.000) extending to the Broca's area of the inferior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.0001) and the superior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.0001). Significant corrected results were not observed for the studies using resting state. After carrying out a conjunction analysis between resting state and task-based studies, for the resting state studies, uncorrected results (  p   < 0.006;   p   < 0.05) have been observed in correspondence of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal ACC (  p   < 0.006). Moreover, a small homogeneity cluster was found in the right Putamen (  and  ). These results about resting state studies partially overlay the anatomofunctional localization of the one of the hubs of the default network (DN), located in vmPFC\/ACC since the extracted coordinates were about FC results. Similarly, our interest was in studying the contribution of each type of psychotherapy to the brain functional response. Interestingly, the studies that used psychodynamic psychotherapy showed Family-Wise Error (FWE) cluster-corrected (  p   < 0.05) homogeneity values in correspondence of the right superior and inferior frontal gyri, with a small cluster in the putamen ( ). \n  \nCharacteristics of the included studies. \n  \nHC, Healthy control; Dx, Diagnosis; MDD, Major Depression Disorder; PD, Panic Disorder; PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; SZ, Schizophrenia; SAD, Social Anxiety Disorder; SD, Somatoform Disorder; GAD, General Anxiety Disorder; OCD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Anhe, Anhedonia; PDT, Psychodynamic Therapy; CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; BATD, Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression; EP, Exposure Therapy; WL, Waiting List (not healthy; for instance Fonzo et al.,  ); BT, Behavioral therapy; CRT, Cognitive remediation therapy; CBSST, cognitive behavioral social skills training; REM, remediation training; TAU, Treatment as usual; SST, social skills training; MT, Mindfulness training; MBSR, Mindfulness-based stress reduction; E\/RP, exposure and response prevention; NSBs, reappraising self-generated negative self-beliefs; MBET, mindfulness-based exposure therapy; MBCT, Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy; MBM, Mindfulness-based meditation; HEP, Health enhancement program; SRP, Self Referential Processing; MAP, Mindfulness Awareness Practice; CCT, Coping Cognitive Therapy; pCCT, pharmacological CCT; p, Pharmacological therapy; PE, Prolonged Exposure Therapy; BATA, Behavioral Activation Therapy for Anhedonia; TMRT, traumatic memory reactivation therapy; ERT, Emotion regulation therapy; ICA, Independent Component Analysis; ReHo, Region Homogeneity; ROI, Region of Interest; FC, Functional Connectivity; ALFF, Analysis Low Frequency Fluctuation. \n    \nBrain clusters resulting from ALE meta-analysis performed for all psychotherapy, CBT, PDT, and mindfulness based studies. \n  \nBA, Broadman Area; L, Left; R, Right. \n    \nBrain clusters resulting from the conjunction analysis between resting state and task based studies. \n  \nBA, Broadmann Area; L, Left; R, Right; dACC, Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex. \n    \nBrain clusters resulting from the conjunction analysis between resting state and task based studies.

Comparing T1 and T2, CBT studies showed two bilateral clusters in the dorsal anterior insulae (  p   < 0.001) and the involvement of the medial superior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.0005). Moreover, after Mindful-based therapy, left inferior frontal gyrus showed uncorrected homogeneity (  p   < 0.0001). \n\nFurthermore, Behavioral Analysis (Lancaster et al.,  ) of the ALE resulting maps has been performed using Behavioral Analysis plugin of Mango v.2.6 ( ). Behavioral Analysis presented for BrainMap's five Behavioral Domains (Action, Cognition, Emotion, Interoception, and Perception) and sixty sub-domains. Only z-scores \u2265 3.0 are considered significant (  p   \u2264 0.05 with Bonferroni corr.,  ). All psychotherapies resulted in a map that allowed significant Behavioral analysis for the domain cognition (Language and Memory;   z   = 5.09) and emotion (Negative;   z   = 3.04). ALE task map did not show significant results for the above-mentioned domains. ALE resting state fMRI map showed significant results for the domain emotion (Positive reward \/Gain;   z   = 3.236). The observed homogeneous clusters in the CBT-ALE map allowed significant cognition domain (reasoning, language, memory, and attention) and emotion domain (reward). \n  \nFigure depicts behavioral analysis of the ALE resulting maps using Behavioral Analysis plugin of Mango v.2.6.

In other words, we tried to answer the question of how brain function changes after psychotherapy, using fMRI. Our second, related question was to assess the contribution of psychodynamic therapy from a neural point of view, underscoring any potential differences with non-PDT. \n\nOur meta-analysis consisted of studies that had acquired serial neuroimaging scans prior to and following a course of treatment with a psychological therapy. Longitudinal brain imaging studies of both resting state and of emotional-cognitive tasks, using fMRI, were included, and analyzed separately and conjunctly. \n\n\n## All studies together \n  \nThe map including all studies that assessed longitudinal brain changes showed two homogeneous clusters from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and caudally involving the anterior portion of the insular cortex. This finding is not surprising, both because of previous similar results existing in the literature and the specific functions of these regions. Specifically, Fu et al. ( ) found the OFC is one of the regions predictive of a good clinical response to psychotherapy. The prefrontal cortex, in general, has a complex role in the control and organization of behavior. In this context, the OFC is a fundamental part of the mesolimbic system, uniquely placed to integrate sensory and autonomic information to modulate behavior through both visceral and motor systems (Kringelbach,  ). This structure is specialized in processing the reward value of numerous types of stimuli (Rolls et al.,  ). Greater activity in this area may reflect an increased responsivity to hedonic stimuli and reward, the inverse of anhedonia, which is predictive of a better clinical response (Fu et al.,  ). The OFC also has a role to connect and \u201cmake sense\u201d of reality through sensory integration, modulation of visceral reactions, participating in learning, prediction and decision making for emotional and reward-related behaviors (Kringelbach,  ). All these complex activities are critical for psychotherapy, from the embodied mind to emotion, learning, and prediction. Decreased functional connectivity of the OFC with medial temporal lobe areas involved in memory is found in patients with depression. Rolls et al. ( ) point out some therapies for depression could increase the activity or connectivity of the medial OFC. \n\nThe result at the insular cortex is even less surprising since this region conveys sensory information, in contact with the external reality, to further brain regions that allow processing. Insula is anatomically situated in a brain area connected with several functional neural circuits supporting cognitive, homeostatic, and affective systems. Its position and function represent a bridge between brain regions involved in monitoring internal states (visceral sensory, somatic sensory processes, autonomic regulation of the gastrointestinal tract and heart; Singer et al.,  ; Menon and Uddin,  ; Esposito et al.,  ), supporting their processing. This pathway is called the \u201chomeostatic afferent pathway\u201d (Craig,  ) carrying information about the body. Particularly, information arising from the body reaches the middle and posterior parts of the insula and then is projected in the anterior insula. The awareness of salient events is represented in the anterior insula, whereas more sensory attributes are represented posteriorly (Craig,  ,  ,  ). Insula is a core structure that receives bodily information, filters salient stimuli, processes them, and then engages\u2014through anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the central executive network, and the default network (DN)\u2014memory and functions connected to the self (Cieri and Esposito,  ; Cieri,  ). Given its functions, the insula is considered a central hub for the allostatic-homeostatic regulatory process between mother and infant (Scalabrini et al.,  ). This element makes considerable sense in a psychodynamic context, where the transferal phenomena between the analyst and the analysand can recall the mother and the infant. This region is also considered a bridge that connect the three level of self as recently proposed by Northoff and colleagues (Scalabrini et al.,  ,  ; Qin et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Emotional and cognitive tasks \n  \nThe result at the anterior insula is also present in emotional and cognitive task studies, together with the inferior and superior frontal gyrus. Within the frontal lobe, inferior and superior frontal gyrus are the target influenced especially by PDT and mindfulness, while CBT was linked to significant modification of medial superior frontal gyrus. The inferior frontal gyrus corresponds to Broca's area, therefore involved in language processing, speech production, lexical and semantic processes, syntactic, and phonological processes, all functions present and vital in the context of the talking cure. Moreover, other fMRI research has shown that the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal within the inferior frontal gyrus increases at the point of inhibitory control when compared to a baseline of routine responding (Menon et al.,  ). In other words, this area seems to play a key role in the inhibition processes (Verbruggen and Logan,  ). This result makes sense in the task paradigm, and it also finds a natural expression within a psychotherapeutic treatment where the inhibition processes are often faced and discussed within treatment. \n\nThe superior frontal gyrus is thought to contribute to higher cognitive functions and particularly to working memory, but its activation during conflict anticipation is positively correlated with the capacity of inhibitory control associated with both efficient response inhibition and less motor urgency (Hu et al.,  ). Again, we find an involvement of inhibitory control through top-down processes or more focus on bottom-up mental states. We will take up these results about the superior and inferior frontal gyrus later in the discussion of the PDT. \n\n\n## Resting state studies \n  \nAlthough significant corrected results were not observed for the studies using resting state, we will briefly discuss the uncorrected results at the level of another important area: the ACC. As we pointed out in a prior study (Cera et al.,  ) this structure is involved along with the insular cortex, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the nuclei in the tegmentum and the hypothalamus, in the regulation of attentional focus by integrating external and internal stimuli, and in the expression of emotional states, thus modulating a motivational state toward homeostasis (Damasio et al.,  ; Cera et al.,  ). Sankar et al. ( ), in their meta-analysis showed significant interaction effect of CBT to the rostral ACC in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. The findings could provide some insight into the potential mechanisms and specificity of treatment effects of this therapy. Patients with major depression showed increased activity following psychological therapy while healthy subjects have shown decreased activity at the follow up scan. In our current result, we found the involvement of the dorsal ACC, part of the salience network, implicated with emotional processing and the supramarginal gyrus, part of the DN, which plays a role in the therapeutic process (Cieri,  ; Rabeyron,  ). The poor specificity of our study (disorders and therapies) and the relatively small sample size could be among the reasons why the ACC did not survive multiple comparisons correction. \n\n\n## Psychodynamic specificity \n  \nWe also were interested in addressing the specific contribution of PDT. While the low number of psychodynamic studies in this field limits statistical power, the studies that used PDT showed Family-Wise Error (FWE) cluster-corrected (  p   < 0.05) homogeneity values in the right superior and inferior frontal gyri, with a small cluster in the putamen. We have already mentioned the potential role of the inferior and superior frontal gyri, extending beyond the important function of language to the potential inhibitory role stimulated or developed in therapy. We also note that the inferior frontal gyrus, as part of the frontal cortex, is a neocortical region that coordinate a wide range of neuropsychological processes (Miller and Cohen,  ), with an important role modulating bottom-up process such as regulation of behavior that is more automatic, but also included in processes when behavior must be guided by internal states, with a more classic top-down function. Many regions in this area overlap with the human mirror neuron network (inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus) involved in action observation and execution (Rizzolatti and Craighero,  ). Modulation, inhibition processes, focus on internal states and the involvement of the mirror neuron network are vital components of any psychotherapy, in fact in this case a result present in PDT, CBT and mindfulness. The insula also has been shown to act in concert with the human mirror neuron system during imitation and observation of emotions (e.g., empathy; Carr et al.,  ; Uddin et al.,  ), which again, are expected to have a fundamental role in psychotherapy, not only as a requirement of the therapist and the patient within the therapy, but as a function potentially developed during treatment. \n\nConcerning the insula, it is worth mentioning that the anterior portion of this region (and the von Economo neurons it contains) has a crucial role in awareness, and thus it needs to be considered as a potential neural correlate of consciousness (Craig,  ) with a peculiar meaning for our study, and with a potential fundamental role in psychotherapy. \n\nA specific region significant for the psychodynamic approach is the putamen. It is part of basal ganglia, which has long been assumed not only to play a role in motor planning and control, but also involved in several language aspects (Vi\u00f1as-Guasch and Wu,  ) including lexical, morphological (Friederici,  ), syntactic (Teichmann et al.,  ), and speech production processes (Oberhuber et al.,  ). Moreover, the basal ganglia are involved in mammalian learning and memory (Aosaki et al.,  ; for a review see Packard and Knowlton,  ). It should be noted that there is also extensive research examining the role of the basal ganglia in adaptation in motor control (Graybiel et al.,  ), neural representations of habits (Jog et al.,  ), space and direction and navigation (Wiener,  ; Mizumori et al.,  ), explored also through neural computational modeling (e.g., Gillies and Arbuthnott,  ). We can speculate that the involvement of this region in PDT\u2014with a role not only on movement and language, but also involved in habits, neural representation, navigation, and memory\u2014could be stimulated by a technique that works more with space-time, memory and dreaming, compared to more cognitive psychotherapy approaches that are focused on symptoms and the here and now, with less focus to the past and future (Cieri,  ), landmark of psychoanalysis and PDT. We also found it intriguing that some authors (Bartels and Zeki,  ; Zeki and Romaya,  ) found equal activation of the network involving this region by love and hate (Zeki and Romaya,  ). We can speculate that this overlapping has several theoretical and clinical psychodynamic precedents. In \u201cInstinct and Their Vicissitudes\u201d, Freud ( ) claims that love and hate characterize the natural relationships of the ego with the objects. Klein ( ) at the very beginning of her \u201cLove, Guilt, and Reparation\u201d points out how destructive impulses play in interaction of hate and love and how feelings of love and tendencies to reparation develop in connection with aggressive impulses and in spite of them. In fact, the baby's first object of love and hate\u2014her mother\u2014is both desired and hated with all the intensity and strength that is characteristic of the early urges of the baby. From a more clinical perspective, Winnicott ( ) in \u201cHate in the Counter-Transference\u201d, resume Freud and Klein's perspectives, underscoring that these two affects overlap both in the patient, and the therapist. He points out that during the analysis of patients with and without psychosis, therapists must find themselves in a position comparable to that of the mother of a new-born baby, highlighting the presence of love and hate, both in the mother toward the baby and in the therapist toward the patient. \n\nBefore the conclusion and specifically with regard to the psychodynamic contribution, we want to use a metaphor from Kant ( ,  ), from \u201cCritique of Pure Reason\u201d where he uses the metaphor of the dove to express something potentially similar to the dialogue between neuroscience and psychoanalysis: \n \n\u201cThe light dove, in free flight cutting through the air the resistance of which it feels, could get the idea that it could do even better in airless space. Likewise, Plato abandoned the world of the senses because it posed so many hindrances for the understanding and dared to go beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of pure understanding.\u201d \n \nThis image of dove and its flight could be taken in consideration in this field thinking about some psychoanalysis that believes that it doesn't need methodological research, especially in the field of the brain sciences. On the other hand, neuroscientific research nowadays relies almost exclusively on algorithms and artificial intelligence without taking into consideration the subjective experience of patients. Today, a psychodynamic approach without dialogue with neuroscience sounds \u201cbrainless.\u201d In contrast, brain neuroscientific research sounds \u201cmindless\u201d without the consideration of subjective individual experience (Cieri,  ). Each approach needs the other side of the mind-brain system; according to Kant's metaphor, both sides need the resistance of the air to fly. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn this work we systematically reviewed the evidence of effect of psychological therapy on brain function, trying to better understand the neurobiological bases of the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatments. All the psychological approaches seem to influence the brain from a functional point of view, showing their efficacy from a neurological perspective. It is not easy to delineate a precise and distinguished pattern of changes in specific disorders or theoretical approaches. Frontal, prefrontal regions, insular cortex, superior and inferior frontal gyri, and putamen seem involved in these neural changes, with the PDT more involved in the latest three regions. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOur study has limitations, such as the subjectivity of the individuals as response to the therapy. This element, of course is not a limitation   per se  , it is impossible to capture in its complexity, and it can be applied to the efficacy of the therapy in general. As Fonagy ( ) considered, it might be understandable to wish for an intellectual short-cut to a pooled effect size rather than considering individual investigations, but meta-analyses lack individual patient data\u2014they are based on response rates and mean values. Being aware of this aspect, in our study we tried to discuss neural changes due to a relationship between two individuals (as a psychotherapeutic setting). Even before the limitation derived from putting together different therapeutic approaches, there is an intrinsic and ineliminable limitation in the objectification of a relationship unique par excellence. Related to this limitation, the pre-post therapy observed brain changes could be related to some other factors, not necessary to the specific treatment received. As underlined by other colleagues (Messina et al.,  ; Franklin et al.,  ) such studies are characterized by heterogeneity of therapeutic approaches and study designs. We have differences in sample characteristics, such as the specificity of the disorder (e.g., proportion experiencing first depressive episode vs. recurrent illness), number and duration of sessions, regions chosen for reduced threshold analyses, scanner resolution and nature\/ existence of comparator group etc. that can be seen as potential confounders and limitations. As mentioned, some of these limitations are intrinsic and unavoidable. Another important limitation is the great variety of statistical analysis techniques used in previous resting state fMRI studies that we included. Since the methods to assess low frequency fluctuation, and their variation related to psychotherapy, of BOLD signal can be considered a bias in the study results. Indeed, we included several resting state studies that applied a seed-based connectivity analysis but using different seeds (Wolters et al.,  ). In this way, more studies applying the same analytical methods should be needed, allowing a more homogeneous and unbiased results as reported by previous meta-analysis (Iwabuchi et al.,  ). Finally, our sample size of the total studies used, is relatively small, particularly derived from the PDT little contribution. Specifically, as recalled by Eickhoff et al. ( ), cluster-level thresholding does a very good job of controlling excessive contribution of one experiment if 17 or more experiments are included in an ALE analysis. In our case, we have used 18 studies, but only 4 studies from PDT. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nNC and JM: investigation, methodology, formal analysis, visualization, and writing review and editing.

{"text":"Thompson, William Hedley and Fransson, Peter\nSci Rep, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nSpatial confluence of psychological and anatomical network constructs in the human brain revealed by a mass meta-analysis of fMRI activation\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIt is well-known that the brain\u2019s activity is organized into networks but it is unclear how many networks exist. Additionally, there is also a risk of ambiguity since different names for the same network are frequently reported in the literature. In this study, we employed a mass meta-analysis of fMRI data associated with network constructs originating from both psychology and neuroscience. Based on the results from the meta-analysis, we derived a spatial similarity map between all construct terms, showing that the brain\u2019s networks cluster hierarchically into several levels. The results presented are useful as a first step in developing a unified terminology for large-scale brain network and a platform for a queryable network atlas. \n \n\n# Body\n \nThere is a general acceptance that cognitive processes are distributed across anatomically wide-spanning networks in the human brain . Let us begin by posing a simple question: how many large scale networks does the human brain have? Although it is simple to formulate, it is a question that cannot be answered in a straightforward manner. Theoretically, the maximum number of brain networks could be one for every cognitive, psychological and behavioral phenotype. When considering the diversity of network assignments that can be found within the neuroscientific literature, one would perhaps be inclined to think that this theoretical maximum is valid. If we consider a certain psychological process of interest that is examined in a functional neuroimaging context (let\u2019s call it \u201cx\u201d), it is very likely to result in a spatially distributed pattern of brain activity. The process \u201cx\u201d can range from referring to rather general psychological functions (e.g. a multi-sensory network ), to specific psychological functions (e.g. empathy network ), to specific behaviour networks (e.g. smooth pursuit eye movements network ) to even more abstract behavior (e.g. mindfulness meditation network ). Thus, there is a strong tendency in the literature to adopt network constructs to describe spatial distributed brain activation patterns obtained from functional neuroimaging studies. It is also noteworthy that the naming of candidate functional networks varies widely in the literature. Returning to the question above, is the theoretical maximum of networks reasonable to assume where the brain has developed a specialized network for every conceivable variation of cognitive processes? This possibility strikes us as unlikely. \n\nIf we instead assume that no one-to-one mapping between network and cognitive process is likely to exist, it is to be expected that different networks are identified and named differently depending on the specifics of the experimental context that was used to identify them. Thus, the present lack of consensus in how to name brain networks is understandable but troublesome. The naming of large scale networks may have at least two different origins. First, specific patterns of brain activity may be classified from a psychological point of view into what could be described as psychological network constructs (PNCs), e.g. \u201creward networks\u201d  and \u201cepisodic memory network\u201d . The second kind of network constructs originates in brain anatomy and\/or function (brain-based network constructs, BNCs), for example \u201cfronto-parietal network\u201d  and \u201cdefault mode network\u201d . For these particular networks, the anatomical or functional (correlations of brain activity) structure are identified in absence of a specific psychological function. Once identified, BNCs may be attributed to one or several cognitive process. \n\nNeither of these network naming strategies are unproblematic. PNC\u2019s, albeit intuitive, suffer from being vaguely defined and their uniqueness is questionable, e.g. how similar\/dissimilar is the \u201cfear network\u201d from the \u201caffect network\u201d? The consequence is overlapping, ambiguous or duplicate network names. On the other hand, BNCs also suffer from ambiguity since no unique atlas of networks exists, and there is no general agreement on how to systematically map psychological faculties (or PNCs) onto BNCs. Additionally, there are several instances when it becomes unclear whether a given brain network should be labeled a PNC or a BNC (e.g. the \u201cvisual network\u201d appears in behavioral\/psychological contexts of vision processes as well as in functional brain network contexts where it can be reliably detected using resting state fMRI). While both PNCs and BNCs have been proven useful to understand the complex relationship between mental processes and brain anatomy and function, the current state of affairs is problematic since different BNC and PNCs are embraced depending on the specifics of experimental context, which results in an adoption of different definitions and boundaries that reflect particular sub-fields of brain research. \n\nTo prevent naming ambiguity and promote consensus, are there any tools for researchers to identify which network their functional imaging results belong to, in any systematic way? While researchers frequently report brain coordinates and anatomical names, since researchers have several tools and atlases available for reporting anatomical regions (e.g. Brodmann or AAL areas ), no such tool exists for relating functional imaging results to large-scale networks. Instead researchers often fall back to the problematic inference practice of \u201cif brain area A, then network B.\u201d In order to promote reporting of results in terms of networks, tools are needed which allow for researchers to infer the underlying network(s). For such a tool to exist, steps have to be taken to move towards a unified terminology. \n\nReturning again to our initial question, this study does not aim to answer how many networks the brain has. Rather, our intention was to investigate two aspects of the relationship between network naming and brain activity patterns that we believe are of central importance . The spatial topography of PNCs and BNCs cluster in a hierarchical order based on their voxel activation patterns , the same anatomical region can be involved in multiple networks. To address these issues we present a data-driven method to unify the naming process of brain networks and thereby promoting a platform for a naming consensus of brain networks. \n\nOur aims are not without precedence. The exact relationship between the diversity of different mental processes and anatomical networks is indeed an ongoing area of research. Different approaches to the cognition-brain network anatomy correspondence problem has been proposed. The two main tools used in these explorations are BrainMap  and Neurosynth , which both are meta-analytical tools that contain functional imaging data harvested from several thousands of articles . The results from these investigations are interesting. Using BrainMap, it has been shown that resting state networks overlapped with activations during various tasks  which was extended and a hierarchical structure of meta-data associated with experiments was shown to correlate with the networks derived using independent component analysis . Brain activity patterns have also been dubbed \u201cfunctional fingerprints\u201d, and these fingerprints, containing specific activation patterns, correspond to different cognitive functions . More recently, a study identified modules in the brain by clustering voxels and meta-data, and then identified which voxels were present within multiple modules . Using Neurosynth, researchers have also clustered terms into \u201ctopics\u201d of brain activation and mental disorders  and then used reverse inference to reveal associations to any given voxel . Further, Neurosynth has also been used to assign unique anatomical areas to functions such as pain (ref.   for its controversy see refs   and  ). Our work partly overlaps with several of these previous studies. However, in contrast to the hierarchical structure outlined in ref.  , we derived our results based on the similarity between voxel activation patterns instead of meta-data clustering, which enabled us to detect considerably more networks than previously reported. Importantly, using different methodology and clustering techniques, we were able to identify voxels that are active in multiple cognitive tasks as in ref.  . \n\nWe used Neurosynth , a meta-analysis tool that derives fMRI activation maps based on network constructs associated with brain activity reported in the literature (11.406 fMRI studies included as of December 1, 2015). An initial list of 3107 terms was filtered to include only terms with a least one hit in the PubMed database for the search phrase \u201c<term> network\u201d (see Methods). After filtering, 148 terms remained which represented plausible network constructs. These included PCNs such as \u201cself\u201d and \u201cempathy\u201d as well as BCNs such as \u201coccipito-temporal\u201d and \u201ctemporal-parietal\u201d. For each term pairing, we performed a reverse inference meta-analysis (FDR corrected at p\u2009<\u20090.01) identifying fMRI spatial activation profiles stored in Neurosynth. Each pair-wise comparison between search queries   i   and   j   was conditional, ensuring that no article contributed to both activation maps. Subsequently, the spatial overlap of brain activity associated for each pair of terms was calculated. The degree of spatial overlap in the brain between terms   i   and   j   was quantified as the percentage of voxels   j   shared with   i  . This was done for each term pairing and resulted in a 148\u2009\u00d7\u2009148 spatial similarity matrix (  O  ). Edges with a non-significant overlap were set to zero (p\u2009<\u20090.05 see Methods and  ). The resulting connectivity matrix is shown in  . Using this connectivity matrix we aimed to explore the similarity of network constructs as reported in in the literature and derive data-driven candidate \u201ctemplate\u201d networks. \n\n## Results \n  \nThe spatial similarity matrix,   O   yielded by the mass meta-analysis of fMRI activation patterns, is shown in  . From  , we observe a certain degree of structure in the similarity matrix, indicating clustering of similarity between network constructs. The presence of clustering was statistically assessed by testing the weighted local clustering coefficient, averaged over all nodes in   O   (C\u2009=\u20090.0398) and comparing this against a null graph ( , significant at p\u2009<\u20090.001). \n\nGiven the significant degree of clustering in   O  , the next step was to determine the structure of the clustering by identifying communities. To this end, the hierarchical version of the InfoMap algorithm was used . The hierarchical version of InfoMap outperformed the non-hierarchical version (62.9% compression, with 7.4% greater compression than the non-hierarchical version of InfoMap). Thus, the clustering in   O   adheres more to a hierarchical clustering. \n\nWith the hierarchical InfoMap algorithm each node in   O   can be seen as a leaf (i.e. terminal node) in a tree structure. At the first level, nodes are clustered together. Then, in a recursive fashion, these clusters of nodes are further clustered together into larger clusters. This results in layers of clusters spanning multiple levels, forming a hierarchy. Each cluster contains a set of nodes from   O  . Nodes in   O   can only belong to one cluster per hierarchical level. Here, the InfoMap algorithm yielded up to three hierarchical levels. For ease of reference, we refer to individual clusters of spatial networks using the following nomenclature: Cx to refer to the x:th cluster at the 1st level, Cx.y to refer to the y:th cluster at the 2nd level, and Cx.y.z to refer to the z:th cluster at the 3rd level (if present). Note that levels of clustering are arranged according to spatial size of the clusters, meaning that larger clusters are found at the 1st level whereas increasingly smaller clusters are found at the 2nd and 3rd levels. Clusters on the 1st level will then contain all the clusters in the levels below and be considerably larger and more general than the smaller clusters. \n\nAs a first step to illustrate the degree of clustering among spatial BNC and PNC networks, we have in   included a spring-embedded plot where each network construct is represented as a node and its color symbolizes cluster membership at the first level . From   it can be observed that clusters of network constructs include both PNC and BNC terms. Moreover, a substantial degree of spatial overlap can be seen, for example \u201cattention\u201d overlaps with \u201cfronto-parietal\u201d and \u201cimitation\u201d overlay with \u201csensorimotor\u201d. The BNC \u201cdefault mode\u201d overlaps with PNCs such as \u201cself\u201d and \u201cautobiographical memory\u201d. An interactive version of   can be downloaded at:  . While many similarities between these terms was to be expected, our results provide a systematic overview of the spatial relationship between PNCs and BNCs. \n\nNext, we aimed to analyze the degree of cluster hierarchy and the results are shown in   in the form of a tree diagram. We observe that some clusters (e.g. a memory, an emotion cluster a default mode network cluster) are all contained within C1, and each branch off into separate clusters at the 2nd level. To get an overall picture of the spatial confluence at the 1st level, we created binary masks for each cluster, where a voxel was marked as 1 if it was found in any of the network terms within its own cluster, and 0 otherwise. The binary network masks are shown in  . For 6 out of the 7 network masks shown in  , we note distributed patterns of activity which show a spatial resemblance to brain networks that previously has been reported in the literature. To examine the spatial structure of networks and investigate the degree of spatial overlap for all clusters of networks, we superimposed all masks and rendered them onto a single brain surface, illustrating which brain areas are involved in at least two different clusters of networks at the first level (see  ). The spatial confluence of the terms (network constructs) shown in   suggests that brain regions distributed across large portions of the cortex are involved in multiple large-scale networks. For instance, voxels in the medio-posterior parietal cortex, insular cortex, supplementary motor cortex, temporal and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are participating in multiple clusters of networks. This implies that these brain regions have a large degree of flexibility in terms of involvement in networks that are members of different psychological network constructs. \n\nOur next step was to analyze the 2nd and 3rd levels in the hierarchical clustering of spatial networks.   and   show clusters that were interpreted to have meaningful networks on the cortex with a non-ambiguous collection of network terms in each cluster. From the results presented in   and   we note that more general-purpose networks are found at the higher levels of clustering. For example, cluster C4 contains language related terms, but at the second level, clusters C4.1 and C4.2 split up into a semantic and reading network that are separated from the auditory, speech and speech production networks. Cluster C1.1.1 includes a \u201ctemporal parietal\u201d BNC together with a \u201cself\u201d and a \u201csocial cognition\u201d PNC, while C1.1.3 splits into a cluster containing the \u201cdefault mode\u201d BNC as well as PNCs that encompasses \u201cmentalizing\u201d and \u201cautobiographical memory\u201d. The results from the hierarchical clustering shown in   and   allowed us to differentiate which networks are spatially similar, at both a coarse scale (level 1) as well as detailing more nuanced differences (at levels 2 and 3). A list of rejected clusters and their spatial distributions are given in  . \n\nFinally, the results shown in  \u2013  suggests that multiple networks are present at different levels in a hierarchy. Provided the demonstrated links between spatial network activation patterns and PNC\/BNC constructs that are associated with each of them, it is obviously tempting to given each cluster a unique name. However, giving names to each of the spatial clusters shown here may be rather subjective. In this study, we provide a more data-driven naming suggestions by calculating a naming weight for each network term,   w   (see   in the Methods section). The weight of each network term is shown to the right of   and  , where the color and size scale with   w   (limited to max 8 in the Figures for presentation purposes). The weights reveal which network terms that have spatial masks associated with them that encompass masks from the other terms within their cluster more than they are included in other network terms. \n\nThe network masks shown in   and   are surface renderings of the cortex and therefore fail to display the differences located outside the cortex. For example, although   shows that clusters C1.2.1 (memory) and C1.2.3 (emotion) cover different areas of the cortex, considerable differences in the hippocampus and amygdala are not visible in   and  . Another example is cluster C3.1 (motivational, risk, feedback, learning) which has considerable degree of activation in the basal ganglia which is not apparent from  . To facilitate a full picture of all involved brain aras,   and   can be downloaded at   as nifti files. The downloadable versions of the cluster network masks are included in a \u201c_selected\u201d version which are equivalent to the spatial maps shown in   and  . Furthermore, we have also included masks in an \u201c_all\u201d variant, which includes rejected clusters and are provided as a means to limit the amount of subjective decisions included in our selection of network terms and provide researchers with full set of tools to utilize and help assign their results in relation to the network patterns described here. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo recapitulate, we had three aims in the present study. 1. To illustrate that there is a spatial hierarchy in terms of spatial brain network that originate in psychological as well as anatomical constructs. 2. To show that many brain areas are involved in multiple networks. 3. To provide a first step towards obtaining a useful tool that can be employed to systematically report brain activity in a framework of an atlas of brain networks. \n\nRegarding the first aim, we have shown that there is a considerable degree of spatial overlap between different psychological network constructs currently used in the neuroimaging literature and that the spatial architecture of networks is organized in a hierarchical manner. Our findings suggest that there is need for a data-driven and unifying naming scheme for brain networks, or perhaps even better, a comprehensive atlas of large-scale brain networks. Moreover, our results suggest that markedly different cognitive processes may be mapped onto similar large-scale networks. For example, this many-to-one relationship can be observed for terms such as the \u201csocial\u201d and \u201cself\u201d networks, which are both within the same 2nd level cluster ( ). It might then be pertinent to ask whether it makes sense to claim that there is a unique \u201cself network\u201d or a unique \u201csocial network\u201d? The same argument can be made for the network constructs \u201cexecutive control\u201d, \u201ccognitive control\u201d, \u201cattention\u201d, and \u201cfronto parietal\u201d. This situation calls into question an implicit assumption that often is made, namely that a one-to-one correspondence between brain networks and psychological network constructs exist. While the results presented here might only provide a first step towards a more unified way to think about the relationship between spatial brain network and cognitive function, we believe that we in the future also need to take into account the temporal dynamics of within- and between network connectivity to have a full understanding of the relationship between the brain\u2019s repertoire of networks and cognitive functions. By, albeit subjectively, dividing network construct terms into BCNs and PCNs we have illustrated that most clusters of networks have at least one possible BCN attached to several different PCNs. \n\nOur second aim was to show that single anatomical brain regions may contribute to multiple networks. We do not believe that this claim is controversial. Our results show that many brain regions are involved in multiple networks that span a wide array of psychological network constructs (see  ). While this is already known and it has previously been shown convincingly in ref.  , we hope that our results further deter from reasoning along the lines of \u201cactivation in DLPFC implies attentional network\u201d. Further, this speaks against the notion that certain brain regions can be reduced to singular psychological constructs, as recently advocated in ref.  . We argue that the entire spatial context surrounding a given set of brain activations is required to fully infer function from neuroimaging. To this end, we hope that the present results may be used to identify and communicate which brain networks that are involved in any set of brain activation maps obtained in fMRI studies. We see this work as a first step in developing tools for researchers for the purpose of identifying brain networks and a unification of the naming terminology used. The spatial network maps presented here are available online ( ). \n\nRegarding the third aim, while we have presented a data-driven mechanism for classifying brain activation data in a network perspective, we are not advocating the usage that the top term of every cluster should be adopted. Hence, we do not think that the term \u201cmotivational network\u201d should replace the \u201cfonto-parietal network\u201d term. Rather, we suggest that our results and the terminology presented herein might be useful to identify which networks that are involved in any given brain activation data set. For example, if a fMRI experiment yields a brain activation pattern that shows a strong spatial resemblance to the network cluster C1.1.1 ( ), we hope that the results presented here provides a good argument to describe the corresponding the results in terms of the BNC \u201ctemporal parietal network\u201d rather than the PNC \u201csocial cognition network\u201d. Thus, we would like to recommend that BNCs instead of PNCs are used whenever possible, as BNCs are not exclusive to PNCs, but PNCs may appear exclusive to other PNCs (e.g. \u201cself referential network\u201d seems to exclude the PNC \u201csocial cognition network\u201d). \n\nThere are several drawbacks to the Neurosynth meta-analysis methodology  that needs to be taken into account. Foremost, it should be mentioned that Neurosynth\u2019s identification of target search terms in the literature is context-insensitive, which may have influenced our analysis of the degree of spatial overlap between network constructs. Perhaps less of a concern is the fact that two network constructs (\u201cventral attention network\u201d and \u201ccingulo-opercular network\u201d) that are rather frequently used in research that targets the so called resting-state networks were missing from the Neurosynth database. This minor omission could potentially be remedied by formulating more complex search terms such as \u201cventral AND attention\u201d and \u201ccingulate AND opercular\u201d, but at the present time we do not think it was justified to create custom search terms for just these two network constructs. Furthermore, despite the conditional strategy used here, we cannot rule out the possibility that we may still include instances in our meta-analysis for which the search terms   i   and   j   are present in the same studies when compared with another term   k  , which may bring terms   i   and   j   closer to each other in the similarity matrix. Not withholding the inherent methodological limitations of Neurosynth, our results on constructs of brain networks from the neuroimaging literature shows that a considerable degree of spatial clustering as well as a spatial overlap for different network construct is present in the brain ( ). \n\nIn conclusion, based on data collected from a mass meta-analysis of previously published fMRI activation maps we derived a hierarchical clustering technique to construct a spatial similarity map of psychologically and anatomically rooted constructs of brain networks. Subsequently, we showed that the spatial similarity map could be divided into spatially overlapping clusters in the brain that adhered to a hierarchical ordering. Our results suggest that most spatial clusters of networks have at least one possible BCN attached to several different PCNs, which suggests a link between anatomically derived networks and networks that are grounded in psychology. Importantly, we present a purely data-driven approach to classify brain activations into networks, a step we believe will become increasingly important as the functional neuroimaging field of research is steadily progressing from a perspective dominated by localizing brain activation patterns into a a broader view of brain function that is based on the assumption of a dynamic interplay between different networks at different temporal and spatial scales. Finally, in the near future we aim to extend this work and to provide a publicly available tool that automatically, for any input brain activation nifti image, assign cluster memberships and network terms that are most closely associated with the input image, aiming to create an automated network labeling atlas that would help researchers to report their findings that is substantiated in the division of the brain into large-scale networks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Query of the pubmed and neurosynth databases \n  \nOur meta-analysis of the neuroscientific literature used Neurosynth ( ). Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis on search terms that researchers had attributed to networks. We followed the following procedure. (1) All search terms available in the Neurosynth database (3107 unique terms as of December 1, 2015) were extracted. (2) For each of the terms, we queried the PubMed database using the text string \u201c<term> network\u201d and terms that generated at least one hit were kept. (3) The search results provided in step 2 were subsequently filtered using heuristics described below. (4) All network constructs were classed as PNC, BNC or both. \n\nBy querying PubMed for \u201c<term> network\u201d we limited ourselves to terms where researchers had, in at least one instance, reported that term in association with a network. This query resulted in 1027 unique terms that gave at least one hit in PubMed (also performed on December 1, 2015). However, many of the terms in both categories were rather vague or too general for the purpose of the present meta-analysis, or related to research fields outside neuroscience and were therefore not included in the analysis (e.g. \u201chealthy\u201d, \u201cventral\u201d and \u201cdiagnostic\u201d). When terms were perceived to express similar concepts, priority was given to terms that expressed a higher degree of specificity (e.g. \u201clanguage comprehension\u201d was chosen over \u201ccomprehension\u201d). Anatomical terms that were deemed to not fulfill the criteria of what could be expected to constitute an anatomical network (e.g. \u201camygdala\u201d) were also excluded while \u201cbasal ganglia\u201d, \u201chippocampal\u201d were included as they are often discussed in terms of networks. Additionally, terms related to brain pathology were excluded from the list. Moreover, anatomical network terms that encompassed larger sheaths of the cortex come in many flavors, for example, \u201cfronto-parietal\u201d, \u201cfrontoparietal\u201d and \u201cfrontal parietal\u201d. In such cases, all terms were included as one search term. Exceptions were made when the order of anatomical structures were reversed (e.g. \u201cfronto temporal\u201d vs. \u201ctemporal frontal\u201d). Our reasoning for this was that such a naming convention may reflect the fact that different research subfields use these terms slightly differently and may therefore reflect different underlying cognitive process. After taking these considerations into account, 148 terms associated with the word \u201cnetwork\u201d remained and were further analyzed using conditional meta-analyses based on fMRI activation maps acquired from Neurosynth. All 148 network terms are listed in  , which also includes a list of \u201cadditional terms\u201d when more than one search term was included. \n\nBroadly speaking, the extracted associations to the term \u201cnetwork\u201d were assigned to belong to either one of two categories. The first category contained instances where the term \u201cnetwork\u201d were used in the context of psychological network constructs (PNCs) such as \u201creward network\u201d, \u201cvisual attention network\u201d or \u201cempathy network\u201d. The second category included occurrences that were related to brain-based network constructs (BNCs), e.g. \u201cfronto-parietal network\u201d, \u201coccipito-temporal\u201d and \u201cfronto-temporal\u201d. The heuristic used for classification as a BNC was that it is a network which names an anatomic structure (e.g. \u201cfronto-parietal) or frequently reported as being a resting state network in functional connectivity (e.g. default mode). Naturally, some network terms are harder than others to unanimously classify into being either a BNC or a PNC, respectively. For example, it could be argued that the term \u201cvisual network\u201d could have connotations for both categories. Hence, for a minor part of our search terms, we attributed them to belong to both categories (see   for a full list of classifications of all terms). Hence, our classification scheme should be considered as being an approximation, but we believe that the division of network constructs into these two categories is helpful for the interpretation of the results. \n\n\n### Conditional meta-analyses of network search terms in the Neurosynth fMRI database \n  \nWithout loss of generalization, let us consider the case of comparing just two networks. Regardless of their respective ontology (i.e. rooted in either psychology or anatomy), we wanted to estimate the similarity between them in the context of fMRI activation maps derived from a meta-analysis. Obviously, we wished to avoid the situation where studies included in the Neurosynth database contributed to both network search terms, as this will inflate the probability of overlapping activation maps. Therefore, we performed conditional meta analyses in Neurosynth by assuring that the same study never contributed for both search terms when computing the resulting fMRI activation maps. This was done by placing additional constraints when querying the Neurosynth database. Hence, for each comparison between network-terms   i   and   j  , an additional constraint was placed in the search string so that the other network was not included. Thus, the fMRI activity map for network term   i   was created by supplementing the search string so that it read \u201c  i   and not-  j  \u201d, and conversely, the fMRI activation map for network term   j   was based on the search string \u201c  j   and not-  i  \u201d. \n\nThe conditional search queries of the Neurosynth database ensured that the same studies never were used in both search terms when comparing the degree of similarity between fMRI activation maps. In cases where one of the network search terms contained the entire second network term, the conjunction and negation of the encompassing phrase was dropped. For example, the combination of the search terms \u201cworking memory\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d, would result in the query \u201cworking memory and not-memory\u201d. Obviously, this would produce in a nil result, since there is no study that include the phrase \u201cworking memory\u201d which does not contain the phrase \u201cmemory\u201d. In such instances, we used the longer term by itself. In the exemplified case, the two search terms would be: \u201cworking memory\u201d and \u201cmemory and not-working memory\u201d. This results in that neither search contained the same articles in their comparison. Consequently, conditional search queries in the Neurosynth database were performed for all pair-wise combinations of the 148 selected search terms. \n\nThe significant fMRI brain activity maps extracted from of the Neurosynth database were transformed into binary masks (reverse inference, voxels that passed the statistical significance threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, as in Neurosynth ) were set to 1, all other voxels were set to 0). Deactivations were ignored. \n\n\n### Assessing the spatial overlap of brain activity for network search terms \n  \nThe spatial overlap of the binary fMRI map of network search term   j   with respect to term   i  , denoted   was calculated by: \n\n\n\nwhere   v   and   v   are the ensemble of voxels for which the binary masks equal 1. This measure gives the percentage of   j   's voxels that overlap with   i  . This procedure was repeated for all search term comparisons entailing that   O   had the dimensions 148\u2009\u00d7\u2009148. If a spatial overlap between two network search terms failed to reach a statistically significant spatial overlap (see below), the corresponding entry in the similarity matrix was set to zero. \n\nOf note, the measure stated in   provides a directional estimate of spatial overlap between networks with regard to differences in their individual sizes. To make this clear, consider the following scenario where term   j   consists of 5 voxels and term   i   consists of 100 voxels. If 4 voxels overlap, it makes more sense to let   O  \u2009=\u20090.8 and   O  \u2009=\u20090.04 rather than using an unidirectional measure (e.g S\u00f8rensen-Dice coefficient which would equal 0.076 for both connections). Thus, the directional measure allows us to see whether term   j   appears to be a part of   i   or vice versa. \n\n\n### Testing for significant differences in similarity between network activation patterns \n  \nSince some pair-wise comparisons had very little overlap (e.g. 0.003%), we wished to prune the similarity matrix   O   so that it contained only relevant spatial similarities before testing for significant degrees of clustering and spatial overlap. To do the pruning, we performed a Monte Carlo non-parametric statistical test where our null hypothesis was framed as follows: \u201cthere exists no spatial similarity between the voxel-based fMRI activation maps that are associated with the network search terms   i   and   j  , respectively\u201d. A schematic illustration of the permutation test is presented in  . For the statistical test, we created null distributions in which the fMRI activation maps associated with terms   i   and   j   were randomly located across the brain. This null distribution allowed us perform statistical significance tests on   O  . For each pair of network terms, we started with two 3-dimensional binary fMRI activity maps. Each 3-dimensional map was transformed into a 1-dimensional vector where the cluster size and their within-map spatial adjacencies were preserved (see  ). The length of the 1D vectors was 193,622 voxels, which equals the number of unique voxels inside the brain that showed fMRI activation patterns amongst any of the 148 network search terms defined. 1000 permutations were then made to create the null-distribution of spatial similarity. For each permutation, the clusters in each of the two vectors were shuffled to random locations within their respective vectors, maintaining the size of each cluster, and then the spatial similarity between the two vectors was calculated.   O   was then compared to the null distribution and edges (i.e. degree of spatial overlap) were kept when the null hypothesis could be rejected at p\u2009<\u20090.05. This test is uncorrected for comparisons across multiple terms, which in turn may lead to a too small degree of pruning of   O   being carried out. It should be noted that our main statistical inference (see below) is tested on clustering of   O   where spurious overlapping edges would be in favour of the null hypothesis. \n\nAn additional concern is that we are assuming a uniform probability for each voxel to be activated in our statistical test despite the fact that presumably some voxels have a greater likelihood of being activated than others in the fMRI literature. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that we may be allowing too many edges to remain as the chance of overlap may be less if a non-uniform probability of voxel activation was assumed in the permutation test. This leads to the possibility of too few edges are being pruned. But, again, as our main statistic inference is on the clustering coefficient, if additional spurious edges are included they will have a detrimental effect and bias the results towards there being less clustering in   O  . \n\n\n### Graph theoretical measures of the degree of spatial similarity between network terms \n  \nNext, we were interested in whether the spatial similarity matrix encompassing all 148 network search terms showed a significant degree of clustering. The weighted directed clustering coefficient  was calculated using the brain connectivity toolbox  in Matlab 2014a (Mathworks). The local clustering coefficient for a node (here: network term)   i   quantifies the fraction of the nodes connected to   i   that are also connected to each other. A high value for the local clustering coefficient indicates greater clustering. Thus, a higher than chance degree of clustering between terms would suggest that some network constructs are more closely related to each other spatially in the brain than what would be expected by chance alone. To test this hypothesis, we set the null-hypothesis to \u201cthere is no significant clustering of the network terms in the similarity matrix   O  \u201d, which was tested using a distribution of 1000 null models where the out-strength of nodes was preserved . The null model was calculated 5 times, where each edge was rewired 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 times, achieving the same results. A rewiring of 20 was used for the results shown  . \n\nOnce we had identified significant degree of clustering, we aimed to isolate and display these clusters. There are different methods available to achieve this aim. We used the Hierarchical InfoMap algorithm , an extension of the InfoMap algorithm . The original InfoMap clustering algorithm has been used in numerous studies in the neuroimaging literature (e.g. refs  ,   and  ). In essence, InfoMap aims to create efficient random walks through the network. The efficiency of the clustering is determined by calculating the number of bits needed for a random walk. To calculate the number of bits of a random walk, each node is assigned a unique name coded in a binary representation (Huffman coding ). These binary names are recorded when the algorithm randomly create walks through the network. Shorter binary names (e.g. 10) will require fewer bits to be stored when traveling through the network than longer names (e.g. 10100). The InfoMap clustering method allows for the reuse of node names by creating modules, and the same short name can be reused in different modules. Modules are also given a binary names and these are recorded when traveling between modules. This step entails that one always knows which module one is in during a random walk (so that no information is lost) and it also reduces the chance of too many modules being found, as the additional spurious between-module information would increase the number of bits needed. The reuse of shorter names and fewer between-module steps in the walk will reduce the number of bits recorded when walking through the network, with no information lost. A useful analogy that Rosvall & Bergstrom give is that we can reuse street names (e.g. \u201cVasagatan\u201d) in multiple cities (Gothenburg and Stockholm). People use only the shorter street name without creating confusion instead of their longer names (\u201cVasagatan in Stockholm\u201d). By creating names for clusters (cities) and names for each of the nodes (streets), we can travel between nodes and see how much information is saved by creating the city clusters, allowing ourselves to reuse the names. Thus, the aim of the InfoMap algorithm is to maximize compression of the random walks by partitioning the network into clusters. We used the hierarchical version of the InfoMap algorithm which is a generalization where the clusters, which are also assigned to binary names, can themselves cluster and cluster names can be reused (e.g. Gothenburg exists in both Sweden and America). For more information of the InfoMap algorithm see Rosvall & Bergstrom\u2019s 2008 and 2011 papers. The algorithm was run 10,000 times to account for initiation differences. For clarity and consistency, instead of Rosvall and Bergstrom\u2019s terminology of modules, we in this study use the term clusters. \n\n\n\n## Weighting of network names \n  \nTo generate weighting factors of each term\u2019s membership for candidate name of clusters, we utilized the fact that   O   was directional. We derived a cluster centrality measure based on the difference of its input strength and output strength (  w  ) which was computed by: \n\n\n\nwhere  .   N   denotes the set of nodes in a cluster and   i   and   j   are indexes of nodes. This weight is calculated for all nodes within a cluster. The weightings of a cluster were scaled between 0 and 1 relative only to the other nodes in the cluster. When a term is used in multiple levels of the cluster hierarchy, its value may differ as   w   is calculated with respect to the nodes in the cluster. \n\n\n## Additional Information \n  \n How to cite this article:   Hedley Thompson, W.

As no effective drug can cure AD, early diagnosis and intervention for aMCI are urgently needed. The standard diagnostic procedure for aMCI primarily relies on subjective neuropsychological examinations that require the judgment of experienced clinicians. The development of other objective and reliable aMCI markers, such as neural markers, is therefore required. Previous neuroimaging findings revealed various abnormalities in resting-state activity in MCI patients, but the findings have been inconsistent. The current study provides an updated activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on aMCI. The authors searched on the MEDLINE\/PubMed databases for whole-brain resting-state fMRI studies on aMCI published until March 2015. We included 21 whole-brain resting-state fMRI studies that reported a total of 156 distinct foci. Significant regional resting-state differences were consistently found in aMCI patients relative to controls, including the posterior cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyri. Our findings support that abnormalities in resting-state activities of these regions may serve as neuroimaging markers for aMCI. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to an intermediate state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and the symptomatic pre-dementia stage.  The prevalence of MCI is 10\u201320% in adults aged 65 years or above, and more than 50% of MCI patients progress to dementia within 5 years.  These figures draw great attention from clinicians and society at large because there is currently no effective drug that can cure dementia. MCI can be subdivided into amnestic (characterized by primarily memory impairment) and non-amnestic (characterized by executive function impairment) types based on the neuropsychological symptom profile. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is generally regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an annual conversion rate of up to 25%.  This indicates the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for people with aMCI. Indeed, delayed MCI diagnosis in people with high education has been reported to impact mortality.  According to the National Institute on Aging\u2013Alzheimer's Association workgroups,  the criteria for MCI include (1) a change in cognition, in comparison with the person's prior level; (2) lower performance in one or more cognitive domains that is greater than what would be expected for the patient's age and educational background; (3) independence of function in daily life is generally maintained but is less efficient compared with the past, and minimal aids may be required; and (4) the person is not demented. The standard diagnostic procedure of MCI primarily relies on subjective neuropsychological examinations that require the judgment of experienced clinicians. The development of other objectives and reliable MCI markers, such as neural markers,  is therefore required. \n\nThere is a growing interest in the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neurophysiological mechanisms associated with aMCI owing to its noninvasive and task-free nature. The term \u2018resting state' refers to spontaneous brain activity during a passive (resting) state when one is lying quietly with the eyes closed or passively viewing a stimulus.  In fact, resting-state activity is influenced by self-consciousness, ongoing thoughts, states of alertness and readiness to process stimuli from the outside world.  Previous studies using fMRI have revealed a highly stereotypical pattern of spontaneous activity in a number of brain regions, namely the default mode network that manifests greater activity during passive task states compared with various active task states.  Numerous studies have attempted to work out the difference in resting-state activity between MCI patients and healthy age-matched controls. However, the findings have been inconsistent, which might be due to the inclusion of different types of MCI patients, and\/or the use of different methods across studies. \n\nA systemic and quantitative analysis is highly warranted to delineate the meanings of the existing findings in the field. To our knowledge, only one meta-analysis has explored the difference in resting-state activity in MCI and controls.  In the   of this article, the authors reported reduced resting-state activity in the middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and precuneus, and increased resting-state activity in a large cluster spanning the temporo-parietal parts of the brain in MCI patients from 17 independent studies. The included MCI patients were heterogeneous, including subcortical vascular MCI (svMCI) patients  who might have a different pathophysiology compared with aMCI. Such heterogeneity likely impacted on the consistency of the results, given the small number of included studies. In particular, reduced resting-state activity was previously reported in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),  hippocampal and parahippocampal regions  in aMCI patients, such that the decreased PCC activity during resting state was further amplified in AD compared with aMCI.  However, these findings were not confirmed by the previous meta-analysis study.  Hence, the present analysis aimed to comprehensively review the abnormalities in resting-state activity in aMCI patients specifically, who have a high risk of conversion to AD, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). An updated ALE analysis focusing on aMCI patients could provide a reasonable means to resolving discrepancies in previously reported findings. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nA comprehensive online literature search on the MEDLINE\/PubMed databases was conducted, focusing on functional neuroimaging studies on MCI. Keyword searches were conducted using the following search terms: (1) \u2018neuroimaging' <OR> \u2018fMRI,' (2) \u2018resting state' OR \u2018default network' and (3) \u2018mild cognitive impairment' <OR> \u2018MCI.' These searches were confined to articles published in English up to March 2015, which yielded 228 original or review articles. We also searched through the reference lists of relevant review articles. From these research articles, we included studies that reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach  coordinates of whole-brain contrast comparing the amnestic type of MCI and healthy controls. Two of the authors (WKWL and MKL) confirmed the inclusions of the identified studies. For included articles that reported only brain images, we attempted to obtain the MNI or Talairach coordinates from the corresponding author(s) via email (three out of eight studies replied). Studies were excluded if (1) only non-amnestic MCI or only subtypes of aMCI were included; (2) no control group was included; (3) patients had a history of neurological, psychiatric or any systemic disease that could affect cognitive functions (for example, stroke, depression, alcoholism and drug abuse); (4)   a priori   region of interest analysis or a seed-based functional connectivity analysis was conducted; or (5) the effects of medication were tested without reporting fMRI data at baseline. One study contained multiple independent patient samples; the appropriate coordinates were extracted as two separate experiments.  We did not intentionally exclude studies that used a modality other than fMRI, nor focused on a particular analytic approach. As a result, the methods used in our included studies covered the following approaches: regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and independent component analysis. Overall, 21 fMRI studies (22 experiments) reporting 156 foci were included for the ALE meta-analysis ( ). One of them used the arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI technique to measure resting-state abnormality in cerebral blood flow in aMCI. \n\nGingerALE version 2.3.2 (The BrainMap Database,  ; San Antonio, TX, USA) was used to conduct the coordinate-based ALE analysis, which is a widely used technique for synthesizing neuroimaging data.  ALE estimates the convergence of significant effects in terms of foci across different neuroimaging studies. Coordinates in Talairach space were imported into the software. If coordinates were reported in MNI space, the \u2018icbm2tal' algorithm was used to transform them into Talairach space.  For coordinates that had been transformed to Talairach space by brett-transformation, they were first \u2018un-bretted' into MNI space before applying Lancaster's transformation. Imported foci were modeled as three-dimensional Gaussian spatial probability distributions using a full-width-half-maximum kernel estimated based on the corresponding experiment's sample size.  These probability distributions were combined into a modeled activation map using the \u2018non-additive' method.  Next, the union of the modeled activation maps of each experiment was created to form the ALE image that contains the combined probability distribution of finding an activation being located at that particular voxel (that is, ALE scores). The ALE image was then thresholded using uncorrected   P  <0.001 and a cluster-level inference threshold of   P  <0.05 with 1000 permutations of simulated random data based on the characteristics of the imported data.  In the cluster-level inference, contiguous voxels (that is, clusters) that exceed the cluster-forming threshold were compared against the simulated random clusters. The cluster-inference threshold approach is considered optimal because it is more stringent than uncorrected voxel-level thresholds and less conservative than conventional false discovery rate and family-wise error rate corrections. Clusters contributed by a single study only were not reported even if they exceeded the cluster-inference threshold. A total of two ALE analyses were conducted for each contrast (healthy control>aMCI or healthy control<aMCI) in all aMCI patients. \n\n\n## Results \n  \naMCI patients showed decreases in resting-state activity compared with healthy controls in the right and medial PCC (Brodmann area\/BA23 and 31), right angular gyrus (BA39, extending to the right middle temporal gyrus, BA19), right parahippocampal gyrus (BA35) and left fusiform gyrus (BA37) (  and  ). Furthermore, aMCI patients showed increases in resting-state activity in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA39) and left supramarginal gyrus (BA40) (  and  ). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results of the current aggregate analyses demonstrated reduced resting-state activity in the middle temporal gyrus in aMCI compared with controls, which is consistent with a previous meta-analysis report.  In addition, reduced resting-state activity was also found in the PCC, right angular gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus that were not reported in the previous ALE study.  Importantly, the absence of reduced resting-state activity in these regions in the previous ALE study included a heterogeneous sample of MCI patients (that is, aMCI and svMCI), suggesting that the two subtypes of MCI may possess distinct pathophysiological characteristics. In fact, increases in resting-state activity in the PCC have been reported in patients with svMCI.  This further supports our hypothesis that reduced resting-state activity in the PCC may be unique to aMCI patients compared with other subtypes such as svMCI. \n\nEpisodic memory decline is the most prominent cognitive impairment marker that is used to differentiate aMCI patients from age-matched healthy controls.  Brain regions including the PCC, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyri are associated with many cognitive processes, including episodic memory. \n\nDecreases in resting-state activity in the PCC were consistently observed in patients with aMCI compared with controls. According to the literature, metabolic reductions in the PCC are present in very early AD, even before a definitive clinical diagnosis,  which corroborates our findings. The PCC is mainly involved in episodic memory processing.  Abnormal connectivity was found between the PCC and the hippocampus in early AD.  Furthermore, positive correlations have been reported between the resting-state activity of the PCC and mini-mental state examination scores in MCI and AD, suggesting that resting-state activity changes in this region are associated with altered cognitive performance. \n\nDecreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the PCC has been reported in both MCI and AD compared with controls using MRI volumetric measurements,  which could lead to a reduction in resting-state activity. To confirm that the reduction in resting-state activity of the PCC was not driven by brain atrophy, a small subgroup analysis was performed using 7 studies (38 foci) that reported resting-state abnormalities after corrected for GMV or the reported resting-state abnormalities did not overlap with the reported GMV reduction ( ). The resting-state hypoactivation in the medial PCC was maintained in aMCI patients in this subgroup analysis ( ). This finding suggests that the reduction in resting-state activity of the PCC may be independent of the GMV changes in aMCI patients. Whether the atrophy of the PCC in MCI or AD patients is driven by an early change in brain functional activity requires further study. \n\nReduced resting-state activity in fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus may also contribute to memory deficits in aMCI patients. For instance, the fusiform gyrus connects with the medial temporal lobe, including the parahippocampal gyrus,  which has an accessory role in memory processes in healthy elderly people.  In addition, the previously reported positive association between the resting state of the parahippocampal gyrus and mini-mental state examination scores  suggests a functional role of the resting-state activity of the parahippocampal gyrus in episodic memory. \n\nOn the other hand, lower resting-state activity in the angular gyrus in the inferior parietal lobule of aMCI patients may be related to their poorer verbal working memory performance that involves short-term storage and retrieval of phonological representations.  Taken together, hypoactivation of the abovementioned regions is a consistent physiological change in aMCI patients, which may serve as a potential neuroimaging biomarker for aMCI. \n\nDecreases in resting-state activity of the medial frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus have been reported in a previous ALE study that included different types of MCI patients.  Indeed, a previous study that reported a similar resting-state hypoactivity in the medial frontal gyrus was conducted in svMCI patients compared with controls,  and the study was also included in the previous ALE meta-analysis. We did not, however, observe any significant hypoactivity in these regions in aMCI. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the hypoactivity of these prefrontal regions is not a defining feature of aMCI. Nevertheless, more primary studies are needed to generate a clearer picture. \n\nIncreases in resting-state activity were found in the left middle temporal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus in aMCI patients compared with controls, which is consistent with the previous ALE study of MCI.  One interpretation is that these regions are activated to compensate for the reduction in function of other brain regions. However, whether such hyperactivation of the brain is truly a compensatory response or indicates other pathological changes, such as excitotoxicity that triggers neuronal cell death, requires more empirical studies to confirm. \n\nFive studies that compared the spontaneous brain activity between aMCI and controls were not included in the current meta-analysis due to the unavailability of the resultant coordinates. Consistent with our findings, hypoactivity in the PCC and\/or precuneus was commonly reported in aMCI patients compared with controls in four out of the five studies.  In contrast to our findings, one study reported increased resting-state activity in the orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus and fusiform gyrus in multiple-domain aMCI patients, which was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism for the recruitment of cognitive resources in the patients.  It is possible that multiple impairments (in memory and at least one other cognitive domain) in multiple-domain aMCI patients may trigger such compensatory responses for cognitive resources that were not present in our included aMCI patients. Another study reported increased resting-state activity of the left inferior parietal lobule in aMCI patients compared with controls, which was also interpreted as a compensatory recruitment in aMCI patients.  A compensatory response may be sensitive to the stage of an illness, and in fact, the inferior parietal lobule abnormality was regarded as a sensitive marker for the transition from MCI to early stages of AD.  To further understand this difference between their result and our meta-analytic findings, more information relating to the disease severity is needed. \n\nThere are several limitations in the current meta-analysis. First, although we tried to include studies that used similar diagnostic criteria for aMCI,  subject heterogeneity, such as subtypes of aMCI that could influence neuroimaging results,  cannot be ruled out. Second, the significance level of the contributing results was not taken into consideration by the current ALE technique. Nonetheless, our study did adjust for the effect of different sample sizes. Third, different analytic approaches and imaging modalities could reveal different aspects of resting-state abnormalities in the brain.  For instance, regional homogeneity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations measure the local synchrony and power spectrum of low-frequency signals, respectively, whereas independent component analysis separates linearly mixed low-frequency signals, which are all indirect measures of neural activity. In addition, arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI can indirectly reflect the regional brain metabolism and neural activity during resting state by measuring regional cerebral blood flow during task-free condition. Nonetheless, different analytic approaches and modalities could be complementary to each other and provide a more complete picture of the field.  Given that the number of studies using each individual method is not sufficient for conducting independent ALE studies, our results represent a common pattern of resting-state abnormalities that could be revealed across imaging methodologies and have high generalizability toward understanding the neuropathology of aMCI. As shown by our findings, different analytic approaches or modalities could generate similar results, such that reduced resting-state activity was found in PCC in most of our included studies regardless of their analytic approaches or imaging modality. Finally, other confounds such as mini-mental state examination scores, age, gender and education levels that could influence resting-state activity in aMCI could not be controlled for in the current ALE analysis due to the limitation of the current analysis technique. Future studies that incorporate these variables as covariates would provide more conclusive findings on resting-state abnormality in aMCI. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current meta-analysis supports that abnormalities in resting-state activity in the PCC, right angular gyrus (extending to middle temporal gyrus), right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus are commonly found in aMCI patients. These regional abnormalities in resting-state activity may serve as neuroimaging markers for the early detection of aMCI. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4872413,"text_md5":"4837b28b7ae2df77eb73f7e0548624cc","field_positions":{"authors":[0,55],"journal":[56,73],"publication_year":[75,79],"title":[90,172],"keywords":[186,186],"abstract":[199,1610],"body":[1619,20242]},"batch":1,"pmid":27115121,"doi":"10.1038\/tp.2016.55","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4872413","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4872413"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4872413\">4872413<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4872413  Resting-state abnormalities in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis"}

We included 75 studies and 11 of these 75 studies were included in the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis. In the 62 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the primary somatosensory and motor cortex (SI and MI), thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed significantly decreased activity after the treatments compared to baseline. In the 13 positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the SI, MI, thalamus, and insula showed significantly increased glucose uptake, blood flow, and opioid-receptor binding potentials after the treatments compared to baseline. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies in patients with chronic pain, during pain-related tasks, showed a significant deactivation likelihood cluster in the left medial posterior thalamus. Further studies are warranted to understand brain reorganization in patients with chronic pain compared to the normal state, in terms of its relationship with symptom reduction and baseline conditions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPain is a highly complex and individual experience ( ), which elicits behavioral, chemical, and neuronal responses throughout the body. Under normal conditions, acute and unfamiliar pain captures our attention, and the peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous system actively respond to painful stimuli and environments (Eccleston,  ; Basbaum et al.,  ). As the detection and modulation of pain is critical for survival, individuals have developed a pain modulation system in the body by adjusting noxious input signals and cognitive modulation of the subjective pain experience, the so-called descending pain modulatory system (Tracey and Mantyh,  ). Unfortunately, pain could last for significantly longer and become chronic in some patients, even though the injury and painful stimulation might disappear as patients receive conventional and effective treatments. \n\nIn chronic pain conditions, defined as any pain persisting or recurring for longer than 3 months or more (Treede et al.,  ), abnormal structural, functional, and chemical changes in the periphery (e.g., sensitized peripheral receptors and nerve endings, elevated cytokine levels) (Fu et al.,  ; Wallace et al.,  ; Haroutounian et al.,  ), spinal cord (Pockett,  ; Thomas Cheng,  ), and brain (Apkarian et al.,  ; Smallwood et al.,  ) are related to our ability to cope with pain. A reduced threshold and excessive responsiveness to pain in the nociceptive pathway is known as central sensitization, which is a type of brain reorganization caused by neural plasticity, which leads to increased pain sensitivity (i.e., hyperalgesia) in chronic pain patients (Latremoliere and Woolf,  ; Woolf,  ). A significant number of studies have identified brain regions involved in the processing of acute and chronic pain, using functional neuroimaging techniques. They found an important role of the descending pain modulatory system, emotional circuitry, and learning, as well as anatomical and functional discrepancies in pain experience between healthy individuals and patients with chronic pain (Apkarian et al.,  ; Tracey and Mantyh,  ; Henry et al.,  ; Bushnell et al.,  ). To summarize the body of evidence on the functional changes in patients with chronic pain, as compared to healthy participants, previous studies performed a meta-analysis using coordinate-based methods [e.g., activation likelihood estimation (ALE)]. For instance, Friebel et al. found that experimental painful stimulation administered to healthy participants evoked a significantly greater activation in the anterior\/posterior insula, Rolandic operculum, supplementary motor area (SMA), and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), and lesser activation in the caudal-anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supramarginal gyrus than chronic neuropathic pain conditions (Friebel et al.,  ). On the other hand, Lanz et al. found significant activation in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), anterior\/posterior insula, ACC, prefrontal cortex (PFC), thalamus, and cerebellum in healthy participants, compared to patients with neuropathic pain, and significant activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), SMA, and cerebellum in patients with neuropathic pain compared with healthy participants (Lanz et al.,  ). A more recent meta-analysis included 3,815 coordinates from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies applying painful cutaneous stimulation in healthy and chronic pain patients, revealing similar activation likelihood maps for healthy participants and patients with chronic pain, such as the SI, SII, thalamus, insula, cingulate cortex, PFC, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem (Tanasescu et al.,  ). The discrepant results of previous meta-analysis studies can be explained as a consequence of the heterogeneous samples and methodologies adopted across studies. Previous findings suggest that chronic pain affects the brain activity or patterns of activity in pain processing regions [which were originally referred to as the pain matrix (Talbot et al.,  ; Melzack,  ; Duerden and Albanese,  )]. As chronic pain is not simply a feeling of pain for longer duration, its impact on the brain is not limited to the pain network. Instead, chronic pain is rather a complex experience which can alter many other functional networks such as corticolimbic (Baliki et al.,  ; Mansour et al.,  ), salience (Qiu et al.,  ), somatosensory-motor, and default mode networks (Baliki et al.,  ,  ; Becerra et al.,  ), as well as cross-network connectivity between the networks (Hemington et al.,  ; Cottam et al.,  ). \n\nBaliki and Apkarian suggested four distinct phases of development of chronic pain: pre-injury, injury, transition, and maintenance phase, arguing that chronic pain is a neurological disease (Baliki and Apkarian,  ). They also proposed that someone who has a cortical risk factor (e.g., lowered threshold for conscious experience of pain in response to nociceptive inputs, anatomical properties of the corticolimbic circuitry) might have a greater propensity to developing chronic pain from acute pain (Baliki et al.,  ; Mansour et al.,  ; Baliki and Apkarian,  ; Vachon-Presseau et al.,  ). From this point of view, we can assume that untreated changes in the brain may result in a persistent pain cycle, and that the modulation of structural and functional changes in the brain may be a key to successful chronic pain management. Growing evidence points toward the clinical effectiveness of interventions targeting brain activity in patients, such as brain stimulation, hypnosis, and meditation (Jensen M. P. et al.,  ). \n\nA few studies have shown that the effective treatment of chronic pain reverses functional and structural brain changes in patients with chronic pain. Gwilym et al. found that decreased gray matter volume in the thalamus returned to a level similar to that in healthy volunteers after hip surgery in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) (Gwilym et al.,  ). Ceko et al. found that functional connectivity and white matter in the insula were normalized after treatment (spine surgery or zygapophysial joint block), and that the degree of altered functional connectivity in the insula and dorsolateral PFC was significantly correlated with pain reduction in patients with chronic low back pain (Ceko et al.,  ). In addition to the functional and anatomical changes, the effects of pain treatment on the metabolic processes in chronic pain populations have been demonstrated using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). For example, PET studies have demonstrated the effects and mechanisms of neurostimulation techniques in neuropathic pain patients. Yoon et al. found that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the primary motor cortex (MI) in neuropathic pain patients significantly reduced subjective pain scores. They showed that glucose metabolism was significantly decreased in the dorsolateral PFC, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and increased in the SI, insula, and ACC in the tDCS group than in the sham stimulation group (Yoon et al.,  ). Kishima et al. also found that spinal cord stimulation significantly reduced subjective pain ratings and increased cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, MI, ACC, and dorsolateral PFC after the treatment compared to baseline (Kishima et al.,  ). These findings provide evidence for clinical use of neurostimulation treatments in chronic pain patients and insights about their actions in the brain. \n\nIt has been discussed that substantial functional, structural, and molecular changes in the brain regions and networks are associated with many chronic pain conditions, and our brain may reorganize itself after treatment, as it did when it experienced chronic pain. However, it is still unclear which regions are adaptable and which are not, or which regions are showing consistent changes across various chronic pain conditions while other regions show heterogeneous changes which cannot be detectable by meta-analytic approach. To answer this question, we reviewed previous functional neuroimaging studies that examined functional and molecular activities altered by pain relief interventions, as a whole-brain meta-analysis was carried out on a subset of the included fMRI studies that studied pain-related tasks in patient populations with chronic pain. As we assumed that imaging conditions (resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, PET) and tasks (pain-related, motor, cognitive, etc.) were highly heterogeneous, we limited the meta-analysis to fMRI results measured during painful tasks (painful stimulation task or pain-related motor task) with whole-brain coordinate-level data (peak x, y, z coordinates, and anatomical template). \n\nOur research question according to the Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome (PICO) protocol (Higgins et al.,  ) then is: in which brain regions functional and molecular brain activities in chronic pain patients, measured by functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and PET, would show consistent and significant change, either increased or decreased by treatment of chronic pain. We assumed that changes of affected functional and metabolic activities are driven by reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness in chronic pain patients, since most functional neuroimaging studies have reported significant improvements in pain and successful pain relief should be warranted for further investigation of the neural mechanisms of interventions for chronic pain. On the other hand, improvements of reward systems and cognitive networks might vary across different types of diseases and interventions as higher cognitive functions are unlikely to be changed by pain relief. Based on the assumption, we hypothesized that the treatment of chronic pain can alter functional and metabolic activities in the brain regions, especially the hub of the pain-related networks, and such changes are more consistent within the regions associated with the affective and sensory-discriminative components of pain (SI, MI, thalamus, ACC, and insula) than other regions involved in cognitive control and reward processing (limbic and frontal cortices). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and Article Selection \n  \nA systematic review was conducted, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). Both fMRI and PET studies in chronic pain patients were searched in the PubMed and fMRI data repository NeuroSynth ( ) on 2  February 2020. We searched PubMed using chronic pain-related keywords [chronic pain, neuropathic, chronic back pain, fibromyalgia (FM), migraine, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease], neuroimaging-related keywords (fMRI, PET, and brain activation), and treatment-related keywords (treatment, intervention, medication, drug, acupuncture, etc.). Keywords for the NeuroSynth repository search included chronic pain diseases and their relevant terms such as chronic pain, neuropathic pain, chronic back pain, chronic low back pain, FM, migraine, IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., and we did not restrict the search to certain diseases. References of the searched articles were reviewed manually. \n\nAbstracts were reviewed by two reviewers (I. S. L and D. W. K) for inclusion. We predefined eligibility criteria following the PICO protocol (Higgins et al.,  ). Articles were considered eligible if they 1) included chronic pain patients (clearly describing that patients are suffering from \u2018chronic pain\u2019 or suffering from pain disease for more than 3 months), 2) administered any type of interventions (e.g., pharmacological drug, cognitive therapy, neural stimulation), 3) included functional neuroimaging measurements (e.g., resting-state or task-related fMRI, PET), and 4) investigated patients' brain activity at least twice, before and after the treatment (henceforth referred to as PRE and POST, respectively). As we were interested in the effects of pain treatments on functional and metabolic brain activities, we excluded studies that 1) did not precisely describe the duration of pain or diagnosis criteria, 2) included chronic pain patients during a period of remission, 3) combined neuroimaging results of patients with chronic pain and other diseases, and 4) administered a treatment once inside the scanner to observe the neural responses to the treatment. We restricted our search to publications in English. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nFor the systematic review, we extracted the authors' name, year of publication, patient's information (disease, symptom duration, number, and age of patients), treatment, imaging condition (stimulus modality and task), and analysis method [whole-brain voxel-wise analysis, region of interest (ROI) analysis, multiple comparison correction methods, etc.]. Since the aim of this systematic review was to summarize functional changes in brain activities caused by effective treatment, we summarized treatment-induced significant changes in patients' brain functional activities and clinical outcomes, as well as reports of adverse events. \n\nFor the meta-analysis, we extracted the number of participants whose neuroimaging data were analyzed, activation (increased after the treatments in patients with chronic pain; POST > PRE) and deactivation (decreased after the treatments in patients with chronic pain; PRE > POST) coordinates, along with their associated standard anatomical template. \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation Analysis \n  \n#### Whole-Brain Activation Likelihood Estimation (Pain-Related Tasks Only) \n  \nA subset of fMRI studies for the systematic review was also included in the meta-analysis using ALE analysis. In addition to the preceding inclusion criteria for the systematic review, we included all fMRI studies if peak coordinates (x, y, and z) from whole-brain volume analyses and anatomical templates for both the PRE and POST contrasts were given. Due to the high heterogeneity of tasks in task-based fMRI studies, and methodological limitations of resting-state fMRI studies, only those fMRI studies that adopted pain-related tasks were considered for the meta-analysis. Pain-related tasks were defined as any stimulations or tasks related to painful somatic sensation in patients; for example, even tactile stimuli could be included if allodynia was induced in chronic pain patients. Resting-state fMRI studies and task fMRI studies that applied pain-related emotional tasks (e.g., fear) or non-pain-related tasks (e.g., not painful tactile stimulation) were excluded from the ALE meta-analysis. The given coordinates from the included fMRI studies were used to calculate statistical maps estimating the likelihood of activation for each voxel above chance levels. \n\nWe used GingerALE (Version 3.0.2,  ) and performed an ALE analysis on coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Eickhoff et al.,  ). An ALE analysis is a widely used methodology for the coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, in which the probability that a voxel contains at least one activation focus is calculated for each voxel by pooling the coordinates of foci reported in a series of neuroimaging studies, and convoluting a 3D Gaussian kernel by sample size to all reported foci. \n\nAll coordinates were transformed into the MNI space using the conversion tool (Talairach to MNI) implemented in the GingerALE software. Next, the included coordinates were sorted according to whether they showed either increased or decreased activation. We conducted two meta-analyses for the increased and decreased activation foci post-treatment, as compared to the pre-treatment, separately. Statistical ALE maps were corrected by cluster-based thresholding for a Family-wise error (FWE) rate corrected   P   < 0.05 at the cluster level using uncorrected   P   < 0.001 at the voxel-level as a cluster-forming threshold. To set the null distribution, 1,000 permutation tests were performed. Due to the small number of included studies, foci, and patients, we did not perform sub-group analyses. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity Analysis \n  \nWe performed multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the generality of the ALE analysis results. First, we repeated the ALE analysis following the removal of studies with sample size <10 to address the bias introduced by small-study effects. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted using the leave-one-out method as multiple ALE analyses were repeatedly performed by excluding a different study each time. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \n represents the PRISMA flow diagram of the article search ( ). A total of 1,606 publications were identified through PubMed and Neurosynth, and an additional six publications were identified by manual screening. After 34 duplicates were removed, 1,497 articles were excluded. We included 75 studies in the qualitative review, and 11 of these were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. Among the 75 included studies, 13 were PET studies, 37 were task-based fMRI studies, 21 were resting-state fMRI studies, and four studies reported both resting-state activities and task-related activities. The studies were divided according to the imaging conditions, and their details are summarized in  \u2013 . \n  \nFlow diagram of literature search. \n  \n\n### Clinical Outcomes and Adverse Events \n  \nWe summarized only the statistically significant clinical improvements in  \u2013 . Most of the studies reported significant improvements in pain response (spontaneous clinical pain, pain ratings to experimental painful stimulation, pain threshold\/tolerance, pain attack time\/day, tender point count, etc.) or pain-related emotional states (unpleasantness, fear, interference, etc.). In addition, symptoms unrelated to pain (e.g., defecation frequency and wrist function), depression, anxiety, quality of life, sleep quality, and medication use were evaluated using questionnaires and diaries. One study did not report any clinical outcome (Smallwood et al.,  ), and there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the PRE and POST visits in two studies (Petzke et al.,  ; Micalos et al.,  ). We also summarized whether they monitored and reported adverse events caused by the treatments for chronic pain. Among 75 studies, we found that 12 studies monitored and reported treatment-related adverse events (Walitt et al.,  ; Gustin et al.,  ; Tillisch et al.,  ; Petzke et al.,  ; Boyer et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Zhao et al.,  ,  ; Zhang et al.,  ; Pinto-Sanchez et al.,  ; Privitera et al.,  ; Tetreault et al.,  ), and 7 studies monitored but did not report adverse events in the articles (Harris et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Jensen K. B. et al.,  ; Flodin et al.,  ; Sanders et al.,  ; Geha et al.,  ; Rogachov et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Brain Changes by Treatment of Chronic Pain (fMRI Studies) \n  \nThe fMRI studies included in the present systematic review have been summarized in  . Chronic pain conditions included FM (  n   = 15), neuropathic pain (post-stroke central pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, CRPS, cervical spondylosis neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and amputation\/phantom limb pain;   n   = 10), chronic low back pain (  n   = 9), headache\/migraine (  n   = 8), chronic OA (knee or hand), IBS (  n   = 7), chronic musculoskeletal pain, somatoform pain disorder, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, erythromelalgia, and failed back surgery syndrome (  n   = 1). \n\nThe interventions employed in the studies included pharmacological treatments (sphenopalatine ganglion blockade, pregabalin, duloxetine, ketamine, lidocaine patch, etc.;   n   = 23), acupuncture or electro-acupuncture (  n   = 18), behavioral\/cognitive\/education\/exercise therapy (  n   = 12), neurostimulation [tDCS, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and spinal cord stimulation;   n   = 5], surgery or invasive intervention (  n   = 3), drug withdrawal, and moxibustion (  n   = 2). \n\nFor the task-based fMRI studies, 27 studies employed pain-related tasks such as spontaneous pain rating, receiving painful stimulation, and hand squeezing, while another 10 studies used non-pain-related tasks such as visual tasks and non-painful tactile stimulation during fMRI scanning. The most common analysis methods were ROI-based analyses (  n   = 20) and correlation analyses (mostly ROI-based correlation analysis between brain activity and clinical outcomes;   n   = 22). Only a few studies applied a functional connectivity analysis (Napadow et al.,  ; Hashmi et al.,  ), principal component analysis, spectral power analysis (Hashmi et al.,  ), and covariate analysis (Geha et al.,  ; Baliki et al.,  ; Parks et al.,  ). For the analysis of resting-state fMRI, a functional connectivity analysis (  n   = 16) and independent component analysis (ICA;   n   = 14) were the most popular approaches, and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) or fractional ALFF (Shpaner et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ), multi-voxel pattern analysis\/machine learning (Chen et al.,  ; Rogachov et al.,  ) (  n   = 2), graph (Tetreault et al.,  ), and regional homogeneity analysis (Chen et al.,  ) (  n   = 1) were also used. For the ICA, the default mode network was the most frequently targeted functional network (Napadow et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Shpaner et al.,  ; Yoshino et al.,  ; Rogachov et al.,  ; Zou et al.,  ) (  n   = 5); the salience, basal ganglia, fronto-parietal, sensorimotor, central-executive, and dorsal attention networks were also targeted. \n\nThe summarized results of the PRE vs. POST contrasts of fMRI studies in the pain processing regions are shown in  . The SI (7 of 9 studies), MI (4 of 5 studies), and thalamus (5 of 6 studies) showed significantly decreased activity after treatment compared to the pre-treatment baseline. The ACC (increased   n   = 3, decreased n = 6) and insula (increased   n   = 5, decreased   n   = 8) showed a trend of decrease. On the other hand, the trend of increase or decrease was not clear for the SII (increased   n   = 2, decreased   n   = 2), PCC (increased   n   = 3, decreased   n   = 3), PFC (increased   n   = 3, decreased   n   = 5), and OFC (increased   n   = 2, decreased   n   = 1). \n  \nSummary of changes in functional activities (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) in the fMRI studies. \n  \n Red cells with up-arrow indicate increased functional brain activities after the treatments compared to those before the treatments of chronic pain (POST > PRE). Blue cells with down-arrow indicate decreased functional brain activities after the treatments compared to those before the treatments of chronic pain (PRE > POST).

Patients with FM (Walitt et al.,  ; Harris et al.,  ; Boyer et al.,  ; Sawaddiruk et al.,  ), IBS (Berman et al.,  ; Mayer et al.,  ; Lieberman et al.,  ; Lackner et al.,  ) (  n   = 4), neuropathic pain (Maarrawi et al.,  ; Kishima et al.,  ; Yoon et al.,  ) (  n   = 3), headache (Magis et al.,  ), and chronic tennis elbow (Linnman et al.,  ) (  n   = 1) were included in the PET imaging studies. To treat chronic pain patients, neurostimulation (occipital nerve, spinal cord, tDCS\/TMS, etc.;   n   = 5), pharmacological treatment (alosetron, pregabalin, Coenzyme Q10;   n   = 3), cognitive\/exercise therapy (  n   = 2), acupuncture, individualized combination therapy, and placebo regimen (  n   = 1) were administered to patients with chronic pain. Using PET imaging technology, patients' glucose uptake, blood flow (  n   = 5), and opioid (  n   = 2) and neurokinin 1 receptor binding (  n   = 1) in the brain tissue were measured before and after the treatments. Positron emission tomography imaging scans were conducted during the rest (  n   = 8), visceral distention (  n   = 4), and treatment interventions (occipital neurostimulation and acupuncture;   n   = 1, respectively). Whole-brain analysis (  n   = 12), ROI-based analysis (  n   = 8), and correlation analysis (  n   = 4) were the most popular analysis methods for PET imaging studies. \n\nA summary of PRE vs. POST results of PET studies, in which either the whole-brain or regions (volumes) of interest analysis was used, in the pain processing regions is presented in  . The SI, MI, thalamus, and insula showed significantly increased tissue glucose uptake, blood flow, and \u03bc-opioid receptor binding potentials after the treatments, compared to the pre-treatment baseline, while PCC showed significantly decreased glucose uptake and blood flow. Two PET studies showed that the blood flow was increased in the insula, and decreased in the ACC, in response to painful stimulation after the treatment compared to the baseline (Berman et al.,  ; Mayer et al.,  ). The SII did not show significant changes between the PRE and POST conditions in PET imaging studies. \n  \nSummary of metabolic changes (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) in the PET studies. \n  \n Red cells with up-arrow indicate increased measures of PET scans (e.g., glucose uptake, receptor bindings, etc.) after the treatments compared to those before the treatments of chronic pain (POST > PRE). Blue cells with down-arrow indicate decreased measured PET scans after the treatments compared to those before the treatments of chronic pain (PRE > POST). ACU, acupuncture; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; FM, fibromyalgia; Glu, glucose; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; INS, insula; LBP, low back pain; m, months; the MI, primary motor cortex; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; OPER, Rolandic operculum; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; PFC, prefrontal cortex; REC, receptor; REST, resting-state; ROIs, regions of interest; SI, primary somatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex; tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation; THAL, thalamus; VOIs, volumes of interest; w, week(s)  . \n  \n\n### Whole-Brain ALE Meta-Analysis of Pain-Related Task fMRI Studies \n  \n#### Significant Clusters for After Treatment vs. Baseline Contrast During Pain Tasks \n  \nFor the coordinate based meta-analysis of whole-brain fMRI studies, 118 activation and deactivation foci were extracted from 11 pain-related fMRI studies in 256 chronic pain patients (222 female). Chronic pain conditions included FM (  n   = 4), neuropathic pain (post-herpetic neuralgia, CRPS;   n   = 2), chronic OA (knee or hand;   n   = 2), chronic low back pain, irritable bowel disease, and erythromelalgia (  n   = 1). Since the aim of the coordinate-based ALE analysis was to identify brain regions that are significantly modulated by pain treatments, we included the significantly activated or deactivated foci separately during the pain tasks extracted from the PRE vs. POST contrasts. The pain-related tasks in fMRI studies included in the meta-analysis were spontaneous pain rating, movement of the paining body parts (e.g., hand squeezing), and receiving painful stimulation tasks (painful thermal, cold, and mechanical stimulation including rectal distention). \n\nThere were no significantly activated foci that survived a multiple comparison correction (PRE < POST during pain tasks). The likelihood of deactivation was significant after a multiple comparison correction in the left medial posterior thalamus (  x   = \u22126,   y   = 24,   z   = 0;   p   < 0.001,  ), pointing thereby to a significant probability of deactivation in the medial posterior thalamus in response to pain-related tasks after the treatment compared to the pre-treatment states (POST < PRE during pain tasks). The left thalamus, caudate, globus pallidus, BA 18 (lingual gyrus), and right BA 30 (parahippocampal gyrus), putamen, and BA 31 (cingulate gyrus) were also deactivated at uncorrected   p   < 0.001 and extent threshold   k   > 30 ( ). \n  \nALE meta-analyses of fMRI studies in chronic pain patients during pain-related tasks.   (A)   Activation likelihood map showing seven deactivation clusters at uncorrected   p   < 0.001 and extent threshold   k   > 30. Deactivation clusters include the left thalamus (\u22126, 24, 0; 99 voxels), caudate (\u221214, \u221214, 8; 55 voxels), globus pallidus (\u221220, 6, \u221212; 51 voxels), lingual gyrus (\u221220, 76, 2; 31 voxels), and right parahippocampal gyrus (22, 38, \u22124; 30 voxels), putamen (30, 22, 2; 36 voxels), and posterior cingulate gyrus (6, 58, 32; 52 voxels) after the chronic pain treatments compared to baseline (before the treatments) while patients with chronic pain were performing pain-related tasks (e.g., hand squeezing) or receiving painful stimulation. All clusters of activation (increased activation likelihood scores after pain treatments than before the treatments) at the uncorrected threshold were smaller than the minimum cluster size (  k   > 30).   (B)   FWE rate corrected activation likelihood map showing the significant deactivation cluster in the left medial posterior thalamus (\u22126, 24, 0; 99 voxels) after the chronic pain treatments compared to the baseline (before the treatments) while chronic pain patients were performing pain-related tasks (e.g., hand squeezing) or receiving painful stimulation (  P   < 0.05 at cluster-level and uncorrected   P   < 0.001 at voxel-level,   k   > 30). Seven out of ten leave-one-out sensitivity analyses also showed a significantly decreased likelihood of activation in the left thalamus (FWE corrected as above, cluster sizes range 99\u2013100). No clusters of activation passed the multiple comparison correction threshold.

According to the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, 7 out of 10 ALE analyses on coordinates of deactivation foci showed a significantly decreased likelihood of activation in the left thalamus (FWE corrected as above, cluster sizes range 99\u2013100). No activation foci survived a multiple comparison correction in any of the leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBecerra et al. defined the effect of treatment by comparing brain activities in patients with severe pain before treatment with those experiencing less pain after treatment. They also depicted the residual effect after treatment, which means the remaining differences in neural properties between patients with chronic pain and healthy controls (Becerra et al.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis study to determine which brain regions show changes in their functions and metabolic states (the treatment effect), and which regions show remaining alterations (the residual effect) after chronic pain treatment. \n\nIn the neuroimaging studies comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions, task-based fMRI is the most frequently applied imaging technique, followed by resting-state fMRI scanning and PET imaging. In addition to the significant improvements in pain intensity or pain-related emotional states, psychological states (depression, anxiety), quality of life, and medication use were also evaluated. Among 75 studies, only 12 studies monitored and reported treatment-related adverse events. A meta-analysis of clinical outcomes was not performed since there were only few randomized controlled trials, and the data necessary to determine the effect size was not reported in most of the studies. Although clinical neuroimaging studies have been focusing on the changes of brain activities, however, we argue that we should improve the quality of reporting of clinical and behavioral data including adverse events. For example, there are discrepancies between samples from whom neuroimaging and clinical data were collected. Clinical outcomes were often measured using different types of questionnaires or scales, although heterogeneity of the included studies also contributed to the heterogeneous clinical measurements, and it makes us impossible to quantitatively summarize the results across the studies. Although only a few studies provided relevant data, we assessed the publication bias and heterogeneity using available data from 11 studies and found that there's a significant positive publication bias (Egger's regression   t   = 11.08,   p   < 0.001) and moderate heterogeneity (  I   = 58.73%). They suggest that the intervention effects were overestimated or there might be a positive reporting bias, and caution is needed in interpreting clinical results of the neuroimaging studies due to an insufficient number of treatment sessions and lack of an appropriate control group or intervention. \n\nWe found a tendency of decreased functional activities (in the SI, MI, thalamus, insula, and ACC) and increased molecular activities in the sensory-discriminative and affective regions (glucose consumption in the SI, glucose consumption and blood flow in the MI, glucose consumption, blood flow, and \u03bc-opioid receptor binding potential in the thalamus and insula) after the treatments than before the treatments of chronic pain, while other regions involved in reward and cognitive processes (amygdala, PFC, OFC, etc.) yielded inconsistent results across the studies. If we assume that these changes are associated with pain relief, decreased functional activities might indicate recovery from the sensitized response to pain-related tasks by the treatments. On the other hand, molecular activities in the SI, MI, thalamus, and insula might be elevated during the resting and pain conditions. The results suggest that successful pain treatments reduced processing of pain-related information and boosted the metabolic functions of the brain, so that the altered functional activities could be reversed while processing sensory-discriminative and affective components of pain. On the other hand, the regions involved in cognitive execution and reward processing functions might be less adjustable in response to pain treatments, as the complicated and higher cognitive functions might be treated neither consistently nor completely in the included studies. Further studies would be required to substantiate this inference. \n\nThe multiple-comparison-corrected ALE analysis showed a significantly decreased likelihood of activation in the left medial posterior thalamus during pain-related tasks in chronic pain patients after treatment than before treatment (the treatment effect), which suggests that the thalamus, especially the medial posterior part, is the most consistent region affected by pain treatments in patients with chronic pain. The thalamus is the transmission center of acute noxious signals from peripheral receptors to the cortex (e.g., SI and insula) through spinothalamic track, and also plays an important role in pain modulation and chronification. Pain modulatory effects of thalamus stimulation have been tested since the 1970s (Hosobuchi et al.,  ; Mayer and Liebeskind,  ; Mazars,  ; Rhodes and Liebeskind,  ; Kupers et al.,  ), and thalamic stimulation influences the cerebral blood flow in the insula (Duncan et al.,  ), PAG, PFC (Kupers et al.,  ), and ACC (Davis et al.,  ). According to previous meta-analyses, the evidence of functional activities in the thalamus in patients with chronic pain compared to healthy controls is conflicting. Lanz et al. ( ) and Jensen et al. ( ) found that the thalamus was activated by pain tasks in both healthy and affected patients, and the healthy controls showed significantly stronger activity in the thalamus compared to the patients during pain experience. They considered, as such, that decreased activation likelihood in the thalamus may support decreased sensory processing in patients with chronic pain due to the continuous noxious input to the brain, and thalamic disturbances may lead to chronic pain symptoms. Since not all fMRI studies that reported PRE vs. POST contrasts reported them separately for patients and control groups, we could not conclude whether the decreased activation likelihood in the thalamus after the treatments is due to the increased activity in the thalamus during pain processing before the treatments (as we discussed above) or not. We also cannot neglect the fact that functional activities were actually decreased in the thalamus during pain processing in patients with chronic pain than in healthy controls, as shown in a previous meta-analysis, and that these activities might be decreased further after treatment, as our study showed. If so, it suggests that the functional activities in the thalamus may not return to a normal state and may only change upon treatment to a new state. \n\nThe thalamus, ACC, and insula constitute the salience and central autonomic network as well as the pain network (Lee et al.,  ), and they are also commonly activated during tasks related to non-painful stimulation, emotion, memory, and interoception (Cauda et al.,  ). Thus, decreased likelihood of activation in the thalamus and a tendency of decreased functional activities in the insula and ACC might be not solely related to the reduced pain sensations, but they might be also associated with the reduced salience processing. As there is an active debate about the pain specificity in the brain, please see Legrain et al. ( ), Mouraux and Iannetti ( ), and Lee et al. ( ) for more discussion. \n\nGrowing evidence demonstrates that chronic pain is not a longer-lasting form of acute pain. Rather, chronic pain has distinct mechanisms and mediators than acute pain in healthy population, albeit with some overlap, and various factors contribute to chronic pain such as psychological (Vachon-Presseau et al.,  ; Hruschak and Cochran,  ), molecular, structural, and functional neural mechanisms (Davis and Moayedi,  ; Bliss et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Groh et al.,  ; Adebiyi et al.,  ). It has been argued that chronic pain is a disease, in particular, a brain disease (Tracey and Bushnell,  ; Davis and Moayedi,  ), and not just a pain symptom left untreated or under-treated (Raffaeli and Arnaudo,  ) [see Cohen et al. ( ) and Sullivan et al. ( ) for the opposite opinions, and it is noteworthy that we should also consider various chronic pain subgroups when dealing with this issue (Treede et al.,  )]. If untreated changes in the brain result in a persistent pain cycle, the reversal of altered brain structural and functional changes toward a normal state may contribute to the relief of chronic pain. It is also plausible that chronic pain relief can normalize structural, functional, and metabolic abnormalities in the brain. Although we cannot assess the direction of effects between \u201cnormalized brain\u201d and \u201creduced pain\u201d in this study, this will be an interesting topic for further research to estimate the influence of pain reduction over brain changes, and the influence of the brain alterations on symptom improvement. \n\nA survey of patients with chronic pain in Europe showed that one-third of the patients were currently not being treated; only 2% of them were currently treated by a pain specialist, and 40% were receiving inadequate pain management (Breivik et al.,  ). Moreover, oral analgesics, one of the fastest and cheapest medications for pain treatment, are not suitable for long-term pain relief due to side effects, and patients' tolerance to opioids is increasing, which means that the dose needs to be increased over time to achieve a certain amount of pain relief (Hylands-White et al.,  ). Recently, chronic pain treatment, which targets neural abnormalities in patients, has been receiving more attention (Borsook et al.,  ; Bentley et al.,  ) along with the advancement of pharmacological fMRI (investigating the effects of pharmacological interventions on functional brain changes) (Duff et al.,  ; Bauch et al.,  ) and increasing efforts to search for brain markers for pain in the brain (Wager et al.,  ; Duff et al.,  ; Lopez-Sola et al.,  ). Although this study only covers central functional and metabolic changes in chronic patients, our approach is important for identifying neural targets for chronic pain treatment. Identifying brain regions responding to the treatment offers valuable insight for the development of neural markers of diseases (e.g., markers for disease and symptom severity) and treatment effects (e.g., markers for symptom improvement of a certain treatment). For example, \u03bc-opioid receptor binding potentials were significantly increased in the dorsolateral PFC, ACC, thalamus, amygdala, putamen, and nucleus accumbens after treatment than before treatment, and binding potentials were significantly correlated with clinical pain ratings (Harris et al.,  ), which implies that the \u03bc-opioid receptor binding potentials are a strong candidate for chronic pain markers. In addition, intervention-related and disease-related functional and metabolic changes induced by intervention in a single subject will contribute to personalized pain management, as pain is an individual experience originating from the neuropathological state of the brain. We can estimate the effect of chronic pain in the brain, and also estimate and re-evaluate the treatment effects focusing on neural changes using neuroimaging techniques. If we combine multiple neuroimaging techniques and measure various changes in the brain, such as structural, functional, and metabolic changes, we could develop a marker for chronic pain as well as a marker for the treatment effect, in the future. Questions related to future pain management will include \u201cwhich treatment is more effective in alleviating hyper-sensitized thalamic response to painful stimulation?,\u201d \u201cwhere should we target in the brain to reduce spontaneous pain?,\u201d and \u201cwhich chronic pain disease is more likely to be treated by central manipulation (e.g., TMS) on the motor cortex?\u201d; our approach may provide preliminary answers to the questions. \n\nThis study has a number of limitations. As we strictly restricted our analysis to the effects of chronic pain interventions, and did not include functional neuroimaging studies that did not involve chronic pain treatment, only a small number of studies were included in our ALE meta-analysis. A cautious interpretation of the results of the present study is necessary as underpowered studies have increased risk of false positives (Button et al.,  ). Previous meta-analysis studies may be referred to with regard to brain activation during painful stimulation in patients with chronic pain, irrelevant to the effect of treatment, corresponding (but not equivalent) to the PRE contrast in this study (Friebel et al.,  ; Lanz et al.,  ; Tanasescu et al.,  ). As participants of included studies had different diseases with different pathophysiology, our results need further validation. Moreover, they were treated by various interventions and few studies had small sample sizes, and most of the included studies were carried out only in adult populations (over 20 years old). All of these restrict generalizability of the results. Thus, we are not arguing that all chronic pain diseases have a single common mechanism, or that we could generalize the results to a larger population or apply them to a specific disease and intervention. Instead, our finding suggests that there might be a hub region in the brain which remains malleable in response to pain treatment, so that it can adapt itself to changes in the pain state. We need further investigation to clarify whether these changes are causally induced by pain relief or not, and whether the changes we found are similar or different across pain conditions. Moreover, due to methodological constraints, we were not able to measure the relationship between the degree of the treatment effect (the amount of pain reduction) and the degree of functional and metabolic changes in the brain. A meta-analysis of resting-state fMRI studies was technically available (Zang et al.,  ); however, we did not conduct the meta-analysis by combining heterogeneous statistical outcomes (ALFF, regional homogeneity, functional connectivity, etc.) as it might provide false information. \n\nBased on the limitations of our study, we make following suggestions which can benefit future research. We suggest that clinical changes and adverse events should be monitored and reported in detail in future studies, as treatments should be effective and safe, and functional neuroimaging studies are no exception to this point. To analyze the relationship between the treatments and outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, pain interference, psychological state, quality of life, etc.) accurately, we need a standard guideline for reporting clinical outcomes in neuroimaging studies. Lastly, future study should further investigate \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhich factors\u201d facilitate the changes of functional and molecular neural activities in chronic pain patients after treatment. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA systematic review of 62 fMRI and 13 PET studies showed the functional (decreased functional activities) and metabolic changes (increased glucose uptake, blood flow, \u03bc-opioid receptor binding potentials) in the somatosensory-discriminative regions (SI and thalamus) and the MI after the treatment of chronic pain compared to the pre-treatment baseline. Meta-analysis of 11 pain-related task fMRI studies showed that the activation likelihood in the thalamus was significantly decreased after the treatment compared to before the treatment. Our findings might help us develop a new treatment for chronic pain management that focuses on neural reorganization and allow for personalized treatment of chronic pain by considering disease-specific, intervention-specific, and individual-specific responses in patients with chronic pain in the future. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nData are available upon request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nDK and I-SL carried out the data extraction and meta-analysis, prepared the first draft.

Our aim is to find out the consistent abnormal brain regions of the patients with schizophrenia by using regional homogeneity (ReHo), and indirectly understand the degree of brain damage of the patients with drug-naive first episode schizophrenia (Dn-FES) and chronic schizophrenia.\n \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed the experiment by activation likelihood estimation (ALE) software to analysis the differences between people with schizophrenia group (all schizophrenia group and chronic schizophrenia group) and healthy controls.\n \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThirteen functional imaging studies were included in quantitative meta-analysis. All schizophrenia group showed decreased ReHo in bilateral precentral gyrus (PreCG) and left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and increased ReHo in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and right insula.

No significant increased brain areas were found in patients with chronic schizophrenia.\n \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings suggest that patients with chronic schizophrenia have more extensive brain damage than FES, which may contribute to our understanding of the progressive pathophysiology of schizophrenia. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSchizophrenia characterized by disturbances in various aspects such as perceptual, cognitive, social, emotional, and linguistic is a sort of severe mental disorder with high recurrence rate, and disability rate [ ]. About 0.3%\u20130.7% schizophrenia patients worldwide are diagnosed according to epidemiological data [ ]. Some studies showed that schizophrenia is actually a typical brain connection disorder, resulting in hallucination and delusion, which is considered as typical positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia [ ]. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of classification of schizophrenia has still not been clarified [ ]. \n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of neuroimaging studies have focused on the use of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to explore the pathophysiology of neurodevelopment in schizophrenia [ ]. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a highly reliable rsfMRI measurement method, measures the similarity between a given voxel and its nearest BOLD signal time series in a voxel way through Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance (KCC), providing important information about time synchronization of brain regions [ , ]. Evidence indicates that the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia may be associated with several brain neural networks, including default network (DMN), visual network (VN) and salience network (SN) [ ]. However, the consequences of schizophrenia focused on ReHo study are inconsistent. For example, some studies have reported increased ReHo in frontal lobe in schizophrenia [ , ], however, others have shown the opposite results [ , ]. Moreover, the abnormal brain regions identified in these local consistency studies were multiple. A rsfMRI meta-analysis confirmed that the brain dysfunction in each stage were distinct [ ]. As is known to all, schizophrenia falls into two categories: drug-naive first episode schizophrenia (Dn-FES) and chronic schizophrenia. The difference between the two categories mainly lies in the course of disease and the influence of drugs, in addition, compared with Dn-FES, patients with chronic schizophrenia experience more social stress and stressors and indicated more extensive brain damage. Therefore, aggregating the eligible studies to achieve consistent results makes a lot of sense for identifying the respective neurobiological markers, which needs to be done by effective means of meta-analysis. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a coordinate-based meta-analysis, reveals image-specific markers by avoiding laboratory bias in the most consistent spatial changes of brain structure and function across studies [ ]. \n\nTo our knowledge, a few meta-analysis of rsfMRI studies have revealed local neural connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia. Kuhn et al. [ ] performed a meta-analysis on the resting brain activity of schizophrenia and depression patients. Xiao et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis of local abnormal connections in schizophrenia and their unaffected relatives. Nevertheless, existing studies did not detailly clarify the difference between Dn-FES and chronic schizophrenia, possibly because of the unavailability of data. As a result, it is necessary to use ALE algorithm to make a quantitative meta-analysis of the consistent brain alterations on patients with schizophrenia classified according to their course of illness. \n\nHence, the purpose of the present study was to conduct two group comparsions: 1) all schizophrenia (Dn-FES and chronic schizophrenia) and healthy controls (HCs); 2) chronic schizophrenia and HCs. It was hypothesized that: the findings of all schizophrenia patients and chronic patients would show the special ReHo abnormalities which belong to the current known network. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature selection \n  \nThe meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and recorded using the suggested checklist. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nWe have systematically searched all articles in Pubmed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane Library. The search strategy was performed with Medical Subject Heading (MESH) keywords and their related phrases in \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201cSchizophrenias\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cSchizophrenic disorders\u201d [Title\/Abstract]) OR \u201cdisorder schizophrenic\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cdisorders schizophrenic\u201d [Title\/Abstract]) OR \u201cSchizophrenic Disorder\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cDementia Praecox\u201d [Title\/Abstract] or \u201cschizophr*\u201d [Title\/Abstract]; AND \u201cReHo\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cRegional homogeneity\u201d [Title\/Abstract]) OR \u201clocal consistency\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201ccoherence\u201d [Title\/Abstract]; AND \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [Title\/Abstract] OR \u201cfMRI\u201d [Title\/Abstract]) OR \u201cresting state\u201d [Title\/ Abstract] (  in the online-only Data Supplement). \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies will be included if the article met the following conditions: 1) the research target had been diagnosed with schizophrenia; 2) studies were rsfMRI study, use of ReHo; 3) studies based on whole-brain analysis; 4) studies were compared with patients with schizophrenia and HCs group; 5) studies were reported cluster information (e.g. coordinates, cluster size, thresholding approaches); 6) studies were published on English language journal. \n\nStudies will be excluded if the article met the following conditions: 1) studies were not imaging study; 2) without peer review; 3) not whole brain study (e.g. region of interest, volume of interest, support vector machine); 4) articles were not provided coordinate data or even after contacting the authors by email remained unavailable; 5) studies were not original study (e.g. letters to the editor, review articles, case reports, and animal experimental studies); 6) studies were not published in English journals; 7) cohe ReHo (coherent regional homogeneity) was used instead of KCC ReHo; 8) unable to obtain full text. \n\n\n### Data extraction and quality evaluation \n  \nWe extract useful data from the selected studies as follows: author, years of publication, gender distribution, sample size, diagnosis and classification system of schizophrenia, diagnosis, age (mean\u00b1SD), scanner (magnetic field strength), eye state, repetition time\/echo time, thickness, slice gap, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM, threshold), and drug states, furthermore, we collected x, y, and z coordinates reported using Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), which have statistically significant findings. If necessary, information is missing, we will contact the author to obtain original article. We used a 10-point checklist that included specific methods for clinical and demographic and imaging to assess the quality of the literature included basic information and suitable studies (  in the online-only Data Supplement). Literature search, study selection and data collection were performed independently by two psychiatrists (W.Y.M. and W.W.X.), and any differences were judged by two experienced psychiatrists (W.Y. and R.R.Z.). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe data analysis was dealt with GingerALE software ( ) [ ]. ALE is a widely used coordinated based meta-analysis method that regards the focus of the report as a spital distribution centered on a given coordinate [ , ]. ALE technology regards the focus of the report as a spatial probability distribution centered on a given coordinate, rather than a spatial probability distribution focused on a point [ ]. This method allows the creation of an activated probability map using the focus of different articles and compares it with a random spatial distribution, and the analysis carried out in MNI space [ ]. In order to assure statistical conspicuousness, we used 1,000 simulations to test arrangement of randomly distributed focuses, the cluster level Family Wise Error (FWE) of ALE map was p<0.001 and the cluster-forming threshold was p<0.001 [ ]. To illustrate this, We use the neuroimaging and brain network visualization software BrainNet Viewer ( ) to visualize the brain maps of ALE [ ]. \n\nWe first conducted ALE meta-analysis on all schizophrenia patients, then excluded four diagnoses as the Dn-FES (the duration of the disease was less than 2 years) patients experiments (because the research on the first episode schizophrenia patients are relatively small, the significance of combination is not significant, so this study did not combine the first episode patients) and a partial drug-na\u00efve study, after that, conducted meta-analysis on the chronic schizophrenia patients (the duration of the disease was less than 2 years). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Included studies and sample features \n  \nThrough literature search of four databases (pubmed, web of science, embase, cochrane library), we have retrieved 445 documents. After initially removing the duplicates and browsing the title and summary, we found that 28 studies met the inclusion criteria, furthermore, after a detailed review of the full text, a total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria [ , , , , - ].   illustrates the identification and exclusion flow chart for the study. The included research reported ReHo differences in 511 schizophrenia (193 with FES and 318 with chronic schizophrenia), and compared with 452 HCs. The research characteristics and quality scores included in this meta-analysis are presented in   and  . \n\n\n### ReHo brain alterations comparison between all schizophrenia and HCs \n  \nThe comparison of ALE meta-analysis results between all schizophrenia group and HCs group are briefly summarized in   and  . The comparison between all schizophrenia and healthy control group showed decreased ReHo in bilateral precentral gyrus (PreCG) and left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), whereas increased ReHo in bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and right insula ( ,  ). \n\n\n### ReHo brain alterations comparison between chronic schizophrenia and HCs \n  \nThe comparison of ALE meta-analysis results between all schizophrenia group and HCs group are summarized in   and  . We found that decreased ReHo in bilateral MOG, right fusiform gyrus (FFG), left PreCG, left cerebellum, right precuneus (PCUN), left medial frontal gyrus and left anterior cingulate (ACC) ( ,  ). No significant abnormal increased brain areas were found in the chronic schizophrenia. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nOur study is the first quantitative meta-analysis, which combines the whole brain ReHo results of rsfMRI study in different stages of schizophrenia in a voxel way. Our advantage lies in the systematic and comprehensive understanding of schizophrenia in three groups (all schizophrenia group, chronic group, HCs group). \n\n### The Dn-FES in comparison with chronic patients indirectly \n  \nAs assumed, both the two groups had regional abnormal of varying degrees. The significant finding of our meta-analysis is that there are obvious alterations in frontal and occipital regions in all schizophrenia. Meanwhile, in chronic schizophrenia, there are more extensive local consistent changes, involving frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions and even cerebellum. Compare with all schizophrenia group, the results showed that both the Dn-FES and chronic schizophrenia suffered from the common damage of occipital lobe and frontal lobe, which were not affected by the course of disease and medication. It is suggested that these brain regions may be abnormal in the early stage of schizophrenia, as well as not affected by the occurrence and development of disease. \n\n\n### Specific imaging abnormal markers \n  \nOur meta-analysis found consistent areas of decreased ReHo in the MOG in all schizophrenia patients compared with HCs and chronic schizophrenia patients compared with HCs. Occipital lobe lesions that cause hallucinations, color blindness, or agraphia have been confirmed [ ]. As the core area of the VN, MOG is mainly responsible for processing visual function [ ]. In schizophrenia, structural and functional abnormalities of VN have been previously reported [ ]. For example, the association between visual hallucinations and VN damage in schizophrenia patients has been confirmed, and the total volume of occipital gyrus has been reduced, and the white matter magnetic transfer rate and fractional anisotropy adjacent to the visual processing area have been reduced [ , ]. The occipital cortex of schizophrenia patients showed activity deficits compared with the control group in task-related fMRI studies [ ]. Occipital cortex may be the neurobiological basis of visual processing defects in the early stage of schizophrenia [ ]. In conclusion, the function and structure of occipital lobe may also be related to schizophrenia, which appears in the early course of schizophrenia and persists throughout the course of the disease. \n\nAnother area of interest observed in all schizophrenia patients and chronic schizophrenia patients compared with HCs is PreCG, which is an unique region of local functional connectivity alteration [ ]. Evidences confirmed that PreCG plays an important role in social cognition [ ]. Watanuki and his collegues show that the excessive activity of the central anterior gyrus can lead to the emotional processing dysfunction of schizophrenics [ ]. A recent study has shown that the severity of clinical symptoms in schizophrenics is related to the disorder of local functional connection in the PreCG [ ]. In a word, the local consistency of PreCG in schizophrenia may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism and clinical symptoms. \n\nWe also found increased ReHo in the insula in all schizophrenia patients. Insula is one of the most important parts of the SN, responsible for emotional processing and working memory [ ]. Both Increased ReHo and decreased ReHo were reported in the insula in patients with schizophrenia [ , ], while some other studies showed negative results [ , ]. The reason may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the sample, statistical methods and sample size. A multicenter structural magnetic resonance meta-analysis showed significant thinning of the insula cortex and a significant correlation with drug dose, disease duration and age of onset [ ]. Compared with HCs, functional imaging studies demonstrated reduced local function in the left insula in schizophrenia [ ]. Therefore, insula is unstable in patients with schizophrenia, while the increase of ReHo in the insula of all schizophrenia patients may act a key role in the functional compensation for the systematic structural anomalies. \n\nInterestingly, our study observed inconsistent activation of the frontal lobes. In the all schizophrenia group, we found that the frontal lobe was highly activated, while in the chronic schizophrenia group, the frontal lobe was low activated. Previous studies has demonstrated bilateral frontal gray matter volume is negatively correlated with hallucinations which is one of the main symptoms of schizophrenia [ ]. Many patients commit suicide which is a serious complication of schizophrenia under the influence of hallucinations and delusions [ , ]. Converging lines of evidence indicate that the phenomenon is directly related to the dysfunction of circuits based on the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, there are abnormalities of frontal lobe structure and function in schizophrenia, which are related to clinical symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. We speculated that frontal lobe damage is a stable biomarker in schizophrenia. Therefore, the decrease of ReHo in the frontal lobe of patients with chronic schizophrenia may be related to the psychotic symptoms, while the increase of ReHo in the frontal lobe of the first-episode patients may act a pivotal in the compensation of psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. \n\nIn addition to the areas of the brain that were commonly damaged, our study found that in the chronic schizophrenia group decreased ReHo in the PCUN and ACC also was observed, which are mainly located in the DMN [ ]. As we know, DMN is responsible for the consciousness maintenance, emotional processing, self-introspection, and episodic memory extraction [ ]. Once in disorder, DMN may cause dysfunction, and thus lead to metal illness [ ]. Bluhm et al. [ ] found that the decreased functional connectivity between the cingulate gyrus and multiple default network brain regions in schizophrenia. As a result, the findings of our study are highly credible. Other abnormal brain region like cerebellum also play an important role in chronic schizophrenia. The representative characteristics of damaged cerebellum involve deficits in executive function, linguistic learning, visual spatial processing and regulation of affect [ ]. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIn our study, some limitations must be pointed out: 1) because there are only three studies on the FES, we have not combined the studies on the FES and can not directly compare the differences between the FES and the chronic patients; 2) individual heterogeneity test cannot be completed by ALE and ALE technology cannot evaluate the significance level of contribution results; 3) as suggested by Eickhoff, we used p<0.001 as the threshold for cluster formation and 0.001 for cluster level inference. Most results were significant only before correction for multiple comparisons in false discovery rate (FDR), but our results could not be corrected by FDR, however, in previous simulation work, we determined that uncorrected p<0.001 was empirically equivalent to corrected p<0.05 in our approach, we will use a more stringer correction for multiple comparisons in future study; 4) our meta-analysis samples are all Chinese, which may limit the application of these findings in other populations, further efforts are needed to extend the ReHo method to other patients with schizophrenia; 5) because of the limitation of the study method we could not put other factors (such as PANSS scores, head motion) as covariates into ALE analyses and could not assess the effect of these factors, partially limiting the interpretability and generalizability of the results. \n\n\n### Clinical implications \n  \nCorrect understanding of any brain changes in schizophrenia can deepen the understanding of brain development changes related to the occurrence or development of the disease. Based on the meta-analysis of voxels, we found that some brain regions of schizophrenia had local functional connectivity abnormalities. The abnormal spontaneous brain activity may reflect the neuropathological characteristics of schizophrenia, as well as lay a foundation for the establishment of objective diagnostic markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore, our study results give us an enormous assist to determine the course of disease and the role of drugs in different stages of neurodevelopmental disorders in schizophrenia. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nOur meta-analysis showed that the common local abnormal brain areas of the drug-na\u00efve patients and chronic patients were MOG, PreCG, frontal lobe and insula, while the brain damage of the chronic patients was more extensive, including PCUN, ACC and cerebellum, which indirectly compared the first and chronic patients. Major damaged brain networks include DMN, VN and SN, contributing to our understanding of the progressive pathophysiology of schizophrenia. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8390947,"text_md5":"f9ac1652ab1551fcd06988c5cbd616ae","field_positions":{"authors":[0,107],"journal":[108,127],"publication_year":[129,133],"title":[144,250],"keywords":[264,331],"abstract":[344,1887],"body":[1896,21197]},"batch":1,"pmid":34333896,"doi":"10.30773\/pi.2021.0062","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8390947","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8390947"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8390947\">8390947<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8390947  Regional Homogeneity Brain Alterations in Schizophrenia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis"}

However, a detailed understanding of the neural regions implicated in the disorder remains incomplete because of considerable variability in findings across studies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify consistent patterns of neural activity across neuroimaging study designs in PTSD to improve understanding of the neurocircuitry of PTSD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted a literature search for PET and fMRI studies of PTSD that were published before February 2011. The article search resulted in 79 functional neuroimaging PTSD studies. Data from 26 PTSD peer-reviewed neuroimaging articles reporting results from 342 adult patients and 342 adult controls were included. Peak activation coordinates from selected articles were used to generate activation likelihood estimate maps separately for symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies of PTSD. A separate meta-analysis examined the coupling between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity in patients. \n\n\n##  Results  \n  \nResults demonstrated that the regions most consistently hyperactivated in PTSD patients included mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and when ROI studies were included, bilateral amygdala. By contrast, widespread hypoactivity was observed in PTSD including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus. Furthermore, decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity was associated with increased amygdala activity. \n\n\n##  Conclusions  \n  \nThese results provide evidence for a neurocircuitry model of PTSD that emphasizes alteration in neural networks important for salience detection and emotion regulation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n##  Background  \n  \nIn the aftermath of highly distressing and shocking events such as combat, genocide, and rape, a subset of individuals develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by distressing memories of the event, physiological hyperarousal, and impairment in daily functioning. With the growing interest in PTSD due in part to its high prevalence among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there is an urgency to understand the neural pathogenesis of the disorder. Neuroimaging studies have been conducted to examine brain regions involved in PTSD [ - ]. Based on these findings and the non-human animal literature, the prevailing neurocircuitry model of PTSD suggests that PTSD can be understood in terms of circuits involved in fear conditioning in the brain. Specifically, this model suggests that heightened amygdala activity gives privileged status to feared and threatening stimuli. Whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex would normally temper amygdala activity, abnormal function of this region reduces regulation of amygdala output [ ]. Furthermore, altered hippocampal function may result in impaired ability to discern safe from dangerous contexts. \n\nThe aforementioned brain regions, which play a key role in nonhuman animal fear conditioning [ ], likely play an important role in PTSD. PTSD is more likely to develop following highly fear-provoking and life-threatening events than less intense events [ ]. Influential psychological theories of PTSD have emphasized the role of fear structures and fear conditioning in the development and maintenance of the disorder [ , ]. Furthermore, exposure therapy, which involves the principles of extinction learning [ ], is one of the most effective therapeutic interventions for PTSD. \n\nHowever, fear conditioning models are limited in their ability to explain the full range of human experience and emotion. Fear conditioning can occur outside of conscious awareness, yet conscious processes such as voluntary and effortful avoidance of thoughts and memories of the trauma play a vital role in the development and maintenance of the disorder [ ]. This has led to growing supposition that fear-circuitry models are unable to fully account for the heterogeneity of symptoms following a traumatic event [ ] and that anxiety and fear may not be the central components in explaining PTSD symptomatology as previously believed [ ]. Accordingly, the proposed revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) may now recognize negative cognitions and persistent negative mood states as key symptoms of the diagnosis [ ], suggesting that other emotions such as dysphoria are important in the development and maintenance of the disorder in addition to fear. Therefore, a primary goal of the present study was to examine patterns of brain activation in neuroimaging studies of PTSD that may provide a more complete understanding of the neural circuitry of PTSD. \n\nIn the present study, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies in PTSD using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). This method calculates the probability that a given voxel is activated consistently across studies rather than a single study [ ] and therefore provides a more objective measure of brain activity in PTSD than qualitative reviews. Although there have been two prior functional neuroimaging meta-analyses in PTSD [ , ], the present study includes more recent studies, focuses solely on adult PTSD, and considers separately the effects of study type (symptom provocation versus cognitive-emotional) and neuroimaging analysis type (whole-brain voxel-wise analysis versus region-of-interest [ROI] analysis). Symptom provocation studies are designed to elicit trauma-related symptoms whereas cognitive-emotional studies include emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful face) but do not explicitly cue the patient to their traumatic event. In contrast to previous meta-analyses in PTSD, the current study separates symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies to examine the neural correlates of two primary characteristics of PTSD: specific recall of a traumatic event (symptom provocation) and emotional response generalization (cognitive-emotional studies). Furthermore, examining results from whole-brain voxel-wise analyses separately from ROI analyses may provide greater insight whether the regions typically targeted in ROI studies (e.g., the amygdala) are also robustly active when taking into account all voxels in the brain. ROI analyses restrict statistical analysis to the small number of a priori defined voxels, reducing the need for more stringent correction for multiple comparisons; thus, ROI studies are not entirely comparable to studies employing whole-brain voxel-wise statistics. In the present study, we examined the results from ROI studies as they comprise a significant proportion of imaging studies in PTSD, with the recognition that whole brain voxel-wise analyses represent a less biased statistical approach. Finally, we performed a separate meta-analysis to test the fear-model hypothesis that hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is associated with hyperactivity in the amygdala, reflecting insufficient inhibition of prefrontal cortex over the amygdala. \n\n\n##  Methods  \n  \n###  Article selection  \n  \nUsing keywords \u201cPTSD,\u201d \u201cneuroimaging,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d and \u201cPET,\u201d a literature search in PubMed and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) was conducted for PET and fMRI studies of adult PTSD that were published before February 2011. The article search resulted in 79 functional neuroimaging studies. Included studies contrasted a traumatic or negative emotional condition with a resting baseline, positive condition, or neutral condition, conducted between-group analyses using subtraction methodology, and reported between-group peak activation coordinates in standard space. For relevant articles that did not report whole-brain results, the authors were contacted to request activation coordinates [ , ]. Case studies were excluded [ , ] as well as studies examining PTSD and co-morbidity with other disorders, although an exception was made for major depressive disorder (MDD) because of its high co-morbidity with PTSD [ ]. Based on these inclusion and exclusion criteria, 26 adult PTSD neuroimaging studies reporting results from 342 patients and 342 controls remained in the analyses (see Table  ). \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging studies included in meta-analysis \n  \n*  TC  : trauma exposed controls without PTSD. **  NTC  : non-traumatized controls. \n\n SA  : sexual abuse\/assault;   PA  : physical abuse\/assault;   MVA  : motor vehicle accident;   NSA  : non sexual assault;   IPV  : intimate partner violence. \n  \n\n###  Inclusion\/exclusion criteria for activation foci  \n  \nFor each of the articles listed in Table  , significant peak activation coordinates were extracted for negative\u2009>\u2009other (baseline, positive, or neutral) between-group contrasts (PTSD\u2009>\u2009Controls; Controls\u2009>\u2009PTSD). When coordinates for more than one type of negative\u2009>\u2009other contrast were reported in the same study, only one contrast was included to avoid using foci from the same participants twice [ , , , ]. In these cases, the selected contrast compared a trauma-specific or fear-inducing condition with a neutral condition. If a study conducted a whole-brain and a ROI analysis [ , , , ], coordinates from both analyses were included provided that the ROIs were not reported in the whole-brain results [ , , ]. \n\nIn studies that included two levels of control groups (e.g., healthy controls and trauma-exposed controls) or PTSD patients (e.g., PTSD with MDD versus PTSD without MDD), only foci from one of the between-group comparisons were used (i.e., between-group foci for PTSD vs. traumatized controls [ , ] and PTSD without co-morbidity vs. controls [ ]). Following inclusion and exclusion of coordinates, 218 between-group activation foci remained (Table  ). \n  \nNumber of activation foci included in between-group analyses \n  \n P\u2009>\u2009C  : PTSD patients\u2009>\u2009Controls;   C\u2009>\u2009P  : Controls\u2009>\u2009PTSD patients. \n\n*Paper also reported symptom provocation coordinates. \n\n**Papers also reported whole brain coordinates. \n\n cor.   = corrected for multiple comparisons. \n  \n\n###  Meta-analyses  \n  \nCoordinate-based random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using GingerALE software version 2.1 ( ). Coordinates reported in MNI space were converted to Talairach space using the Lancaster transform [ ] as implemented in GingerALE. Coordinates from symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional tasks were first combined to examine the neural regions involved across tasks and then were analyzed separately to examine differences between the two design types. A replicate set of analyses was performed that included ROI-based studies. Differences in the whole-brain voxel-wise results with the inclusion of ROIs, when present, are noted in the tables and results. \n\nFor each analysis reported, peak activation coordinates were smoothed using a three-dimensional Gaussian filter and transformed into Gaussian probability distributions. These probability distributions were combined to generate whole-brain statistical maps of the ALE values on a voxel-wise basis. ALE statistics calculated the probability that at least one of the foci lay within each voxel and, therefore, the likelihood that each voxel was activated across all studies included in the analysis. The ALE statistic maps were compared with a null-distribution of random spatial associations between experiments (random-effects model) to assess for above chance clustering between experiments using a threshold at false discovery rate (FDR) corrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a cluster-extent of 100\u2009mm . \n\nTo explore the hypothesis that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala was inversely related, we first identified whole-brain studies that reported increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in controls relative to PTSD patients (which would suggest that this region was hypoactive in PTSD) and also reported regions of increased activity in PTSD relative to controls. Six studies were identified that met these criteria [ , , , - ]. A meta-analysis was performed on the coordinates from these studies for the PTSD\u2009>\u2009Control contrast. Thus, we examined the regions that were hyperactive in PTSD when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactive. Due to the small number of studies included, the analysis was thresholded at FDR corrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a less conservative cluster-extent of 40\u2009mm  (i.e., 5 contiguous voxels) was used. \n\n\n\n##  Results  \n  \nSeparate meta-analyses were run to examine the neural activity across and within symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional tasks in PTSD. Because of the variability in naming conventions of medial prefrontal cortex regions across different studies, activated regions are listed in the text and tables both by their structure specific name (e.g., medial frontal gyrus) and a general name signifying their contribution to a broader, less defined area (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex which broadly includes the pregenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex). \n\n###  Common activations for PTSD across tasks  \n  \nThe regions that were hyper- and hypoactive when studies were collapsed across task type (i.e., symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional) in PTSD relative to control subjects are reported in Table  . We defined hyperactivity in PTSD as the results stemming from the PTSD\u2009>\u2009Control contrast and hypoactivity in PTSD as brain regions active from the Control\u2009>\u2009PTSD contrast. Patients with PTSD showed hyperactivation in the mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate (Figure  A), left superior temporal gyrus, and left supplementary motor area. Robust bilateral amygdala and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity was observed when ROI studies were included (Figure  )B. \n  \nBetween-group comparison of activity across symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies \n  \n P  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR-corrected, cluster activation extent\u2009\u2265\u2009100\u2009mm .

When ROI studies were included, the results remained consistent with additional activity observed in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (Table  ). \n\n\n###  Symptom provocation studies  \n  \nA meta-analysis of symptom provocation designs was conducted to reveal the regions that were involved in reliving one\u2019s traumatic event (Table  ). The regions consistently hyperactivated in PTSD were the mid- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, widespread hypoactivity was observed, including the medial frontal gyrus (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), right inferior frontal gyrus, and right precuneus. These results were unchanged with the inclusion of ROI studies.

The whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed hyperactivity in supplementary motor area. Bilateral amygdala and medial frontal gyrus (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, BA 8) activity was observed when ROI studies were included (see Table  ). Regions of hypoactivity (Figure  ) included the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and medial frontal gyrus (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, BA 9). \n\n\n###  Ventromedial prefrontal cortex meta-analysis  \n  \nWe next performed a meta-analysis on regions that were hyperactive in PTSD within studies that reported decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity (see Methods). The analysis showed that when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactivated, greater amygdala activation was observed in PTSD, supporting the hypothesis that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are inversely related. Other regions that showed increased activity included the right middle and inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and right putamen (Table  ). \n  \nVentromedial prefrontal cortex meta-analysis results \n  \n P  \u2009<\u2009.05 FDR-corrected, activation extent\u2009\u2265\u200940\u2009mm .

The results confirmed involvement of a subset of regions implicated in fear-circuitry models of PTSD, including robust hyperactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in PTSD, and an inverse relationship between activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. However, additional regions were found to be hyper- and hypoactive in PTSD, suggesting that a broader view of the neural circuitry of PTSD should be considered. Collapsing across symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies, the whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed hyperactivation of the mid\/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus in PTSD. These regions have been previously shown to be part of a putative \u2018salience network\u2019 that processes autonomic, interoceptive, homeostatic, and cognitive information of personal relevance [ , ]. Ultimately, the salience network helps an organism evaluate whether stimuli in the environment should be approached or avoided. Importantly, activity in this salience network is positively correlated with anxiety [ ]. We propose that in PTSD, the behavioral manifestation of increased output of the salience network may provide privileged cognitive resources to a broad range of salient stimuli leading to hypervigilance and disruption of goal-directed activity. This notion is consistent with observations in PTSD patients of deficits in working memory for not only trauma-related negative distractors, but also neutral distractors [ ], suggesting that a variety of stimuli become potentially salient for patients with PTSD. From this viewpoint, negative emotions other than fear can be associated with the disorder, as long as they are salient and associated with a stress response. \n\nThe dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is a key node in the salience network. Earlier conceptualizations of the region suggested that its role was primarily in \u201ccold\u201d cognitive processes, in contrast to the ventral aspects of the anterior cingulate cortex that were thought to be involved in affective processing [ ]. However, more recent data have not corroborated a cognitive versus affective dissociation. Recent reviews have called attention to the involvement of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in PTSD [ , ], which may subserve learned fear, fear appraisal and expression, and sympathetic activity [ ]. More broadly, dorsomedial prefrontal regions (including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) have been associated with appraisal and evaluation whereas ventromedial prefrontal regions are associated with regulatory functions. This dissociation is consistent with the findings reported here, where more dorsal prefrontal regions, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and mid\/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were active in patients with PTSD and may suggest heightened appraisals of potential threats in the environment, whereas hypoactivity in ventromedial prefrontal regions may reflect dysfunction in emotion regulation. \n\nInterestingly, the present results highlight the contribution of the mid-cingulate in PTSD, adding to the growing evidence that this region plays an important role in this disorder [ - ] and may be important for fear conditioning [ ]. The dorsal anterior cingulate spans a large area, encompassing BAs 24, 32, and 33. Whereas a more anterior portion of the dorsal anterior cingulate was activated in both PTSD patients and control subjects in the present meta-analysis, a more posterior region was hyperactivated only in PTSD. A previous study demonstrated that individuals with severe PTSD symptomatology activated the mid\/dorsal anterior cingulate to a greater extent than controls during an emotional oddball task, suggesting that distracting stimuli are given attentional preference at the expense of a goal-relevant task in PTSD [ ]. These findings provide converging evidence for the role of the mid\/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in salience processing. Another region in the salience network, the amygdala, was observed only when using a less stringent spatial extent in the whole-brain analysis or when considering ROI analyses. The amygdala is notoriously difficult to image due to vulnerability to susceptibility artifact and its relatively small volume, which could account for lack of robust findings in the whole-brain analysis. Alternatively, it is possible that the amygdala is not as central of a region in PTSD as current neurocircuitry models suggest, consistent with previous meta-analysis data showing that the amygdala is more frequently active in patients with social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than PTSD [ ]. \n\nWith the addition of ROI analyses, amygdala activity was observed for cognitive-emotional tasks but not symptom provocation tasks, suggesting that the type of task employed within a study influences amygdala activity in PTSD. There is emerging recognition that the amygdala may play a more general role in processing ambiguous and salient stimuli in the environment [ - ], of which fear may be one particularly potent instance. The amygdala, which is composed of several distinct but highly interconnected nuclei, is not specific to fear states but is also activated for unusual and novel stimuli [ ] and unpredictability [ ]. Therefore, the stimuli and study designs employed during cognitive-emotional studies of PTSD, which often present novel and ambiguous stimuli intermittently, may evoke more central involvement of the amygdala than autobiographical trauma scripts, which were often familiar and unambiguous from the start. Other explanations for the lack of amygdala activity in symptom provocation designs are less likely. Both the symptom provocation designs and the cognitive-emotional ROI studies (in which amygdala activity was observed most robustly) were block designs; therefore, the results are unlikely to be attributable to differences in neuroimaging experimental design (i.e., event-related vs. block designs). Furthermore, the majority of both symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional studies were fMRI rather than PET, suggesting that the difference is not due to imaging modality. The discrepancy in amygdala activity for cognitive-emotional and symptom provocation studies underscores the importance of considering the cognitive task when interpreting activation differences (or lack thereof) in the amygdala in PTSD and control participants. \n\nIn the present study, widespread hypoactivity in prefrontal cortex in PTSD was observed, including both medial and lateral regions. Notably, hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was present in both symptom provocation and cognitive-emotional study designs. To examine the relationship between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, we performed a meta-analysis that identified regions of hyperactivity within a subset of studies that showed a decrease in ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in PTSD patients. We reasoned that under conditions of diminished ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity, which may signify reduced top-down governance of interconnected regions, we would observe greater amygdala activity. The results showed that when the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was hypoactive, the amygdala, putamen, and temporal cortex were hyperactivated. These results support the notion that a consequence of hypoactivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be greater responsivity of the amygdala in the face of negative information. Although the direction of this effect cannot be determined conclusively because the neural connections between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are bidirectional, there is a well-established literature showing the involvement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in regulatory control across species [ ]. It is important to note that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is not a single entity, but rather is composed of multiple distinct regions (i.e., subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, medial portions of orbitofrontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus) that subserve a variety of functions. For instance, the non-human animal literature suggests that bordering divisions within ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be responsible for both inhibition and facilitation of autonomic arousal [ ]. This may help to explain why some studies of PTSD show increased activation in this region [ ] and suggests that a more fine-grained analysis is required to better elucidate the various functions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Nevertheless, the results of the current meta-analysis show robust hypoactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex consistent across task type, underscoring its hypothesized role in regulatory control. \n\nImportantly, additional prefrontal cortex regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus were hypoactivated in PTSD. This finding is notable as previous work has implicated the role of inferior frontal gyrus in emotion regulation, including inhibition from emotional distraction [ ] and emotional thought suppression [ ]. Moreover, the inferior frontal gyrus is purported to be involved in a network of lateral prefrontal cortex regions involved in changing one\u2019s negative thoughts to reduce the impact of negative feelings (i.e., cognitive reappraisal) [ ]. Although speculative, it is possible that decreased activity in lateral prefrontal cortex may reflect PTSD patients\u2019 difficulty challenging negative thoughts to cope with emotional stimuli. Contemporary psychological models of PTSD highlight the role of negative appraisals and emotion regulation in the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. One of the most successful psychosocial interventions for PTSD, cognitive processing therapy, is based upon the notion that faulty cognitions and interpretation surrounding the traumatic event interferes with the natural recovery process after a trauma [ ]. For example, a female rape victim who misattributes blame to herself for attending a party where the rape occurred may then mistrust her decisions in every aspect of her life, leading to experiential avoidance and withdrawal from social relationships. Research has supported the notion that negative self-appraisals are associated with PTSD symptom maintenance [ ] and therefore the DSM-V may now include the presence of negative cognitions as a core feature of the disorder [ ]. Cognitive processing therapy encourages the patient to adopt a more balanced view of the circumstances surrounding the traumatic event, as well as current personal events by challenging negative thoughts. Given the present results, future studies should examine whether individuals who benefitted from cognitive processing therapy recruit the inferior frontal gyrus to a greater extent compared to pre-therapy, as well as compared to individuals who did not benefit from therapy. \n\n###  Limitations  \n  \nA constraint of the current study is the availability of studies that met our criteria for inclusion into the analyses. Although the literature search started with 79 studies, the exclusion of studies that did not include stereotaxic coordinates likely reduced our power to detect less robust activations. Although the number of foci included in this study is more than the minimum recommended for a meta-analysis, it remains an open question whether a larger sample will reveal additional networks central to the PTSD diagnosis. For example, amygdala activity was observed in the PTSD group only when considering ROI analyses or using a less stringent spatial extent. Therefore, the limited number of studies available for the meta-analysis may have had an impact on the ability to detect amygdala activity within the whole-brain analysis. Activity in another key node within the salience network, the anterior insula, was observed in the PTSD group using a less stringent cluster threshold (FDR corrected,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, cluster-extent\u2009=\u200924\u2009mm ). Future studies could isolate resting-state networks as a more powerful and robust method towards understanding the functional connections between nodes of the salience network in PTSD. Interestingly, a recent resting-state study in PTSD revealed greater connectivity between the amygdala and insula in patients with PTSD than trauma-exposed controls [ ]. The results are consistent with the notion that key nodes within the salience network are highly coactive in PTSD and may underlie the hallmark symptoms of the disorder. \n\nAlthough there is convincing evidence that the hippocampus becomes dysfunctional as a result of chronic stress [ ] and activity in this region has shown to be negatively correlated with arousal symptoms in PTSD [ ], hippocampal activity was not observed in the present meta-analysis making it unclear how this region contributes to neurocircuitry models of PTSD. Many of the tasks included in this meta-analysis were not optimal for eliciting hippocampal activity and those that do examine hippocampal function in PTSD show mixed results. There is a growing functional neuroimaging literature examining learning and memory in PTSD, which may clarify the role of hippocampus given that these types of paradigms traditionally activate the hippocampus in healthy individuals. \n\nFinally, working with a limited sample required inclusion of studies with patients on medication and\/or co-morbid depression. As additional studies are published and software development continues, future meta-analyses may be able to focus exclusively on PTSD or include depression and medication status as covariates in the analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe goal of the present meta-analysis was to examine the neurocircuitry of PTSD by considering a set of studies that were diverse in terms of functional imaging modality, study design, and PTSD trauma type. The results provide evidence for hyperactivation of regions important for vigilance and salience detection, and hypoactivation of regulatory networks engaged in regulation of autonomic arousal and cognition. The key salience network regions that appear to be important in PTSD include the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (including mid\/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus. \n\nFurthermore, regulatory control regions include two primary networks that appear to be dysfunctional in PTSD, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex control over the amygdala and lateral prefrontal regions putatively involved in modification of thought and inhibition of distracting emotions.

Introduction \n  \nDementia is associated with a decline in cognition including memory, executive function, attention, language, thinking, and\/or visuospatial skills that impacts functioning (Arvanitakis et al.,  ). As of 2020, ~55 million people have dementia worldwide, and this figure is expected to reach 152 million within the next 30 years (Martin et al.,  ). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, contributing to an estimated 50\u201375% of all cases (Gallaway et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough AD is frequently pathologically characterized by the accumulation of extracellular A\u03b2 plaques (Hardy and Higgins,  ), other proteinopathies are often present including neurofibrillary tangles of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, aggregates of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and \u03b1-synuclein pathology as seen in other causes of dementia (Josephs et al.,  ; DeTure and Dickson,  ). Further, cerebrovascular dysfunction and injury commonly occurs in AD, leading to \u201cmixed dementia\u201d, a combination of AD and vascular pathologies (Craft,  ; Govindpani et al.,  ). Together, this variable and multilayered pathology creates a neurotoxic environment associated with neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cell death (Coles et al.,  ). Given the increasingly blurred line between the traditional aetiological types of dementia, interventions with multitargeted effects\u2014such as exercise\u2014that can transcend these diagnostic entities and reduce dementia risk should be prioritized. Importantly, approximately 40% of dementia risk is thought to be modifiable, providing opportunity for risk reduction strategies that may reduce dementia incidence and\/or delay deterioration (Paulson and Igo,  ; Livingston et al.,  ). \n\nThe clinical syndrome for dementia occurs after a long-lasting asymptomatic preclinical phase followed by a symptomatic prodromal phase known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Jack et al.,  ; Sperling et al.,  ). MCI is characterized by objective cognitive decline on the background of relatively intact activities of daily living (Petersen et al.,  ). Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported worsening of cognition despite falling within the normal range of cognitive ability on neuropsychological tests (Molinuevo et al.,  ; van Harten et al.,  ; Jessen et al.,  ). Individuals with SCD and MCI have increased presence of AD biomarkers, cerebrovascular pathology, inflammatory burden (Blom et al.,  ; Shen et al.,  ), and an increased risk of developing dementia: ~2 fold for SCD and ~5 fold for MCI (Campbell et al.,  ; Perrotin et al.,  ; Pike et al.,  ). Vascular contributions to dementia risk, such as stroke and dysregulated cerebral blood flow, have also emerged as important markers for intervention efforts (Rundek et al.,  ). This makes the preclinical stages of dementia, including SCD, MCI, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), the ideal stages at which to intervene to try and prevent future cognitive decline, disability, and deterioration (Molinuevo et al.,  ; van Harten et al.,  ). \n\nPhysical activity including exercise is an important lifestyle factor that, when performed regularly, can decrease the risk of cognitive decline and dementia by 38% and 28%, respectively (Middleton et al.,  ; Sofi et al.,  ). Current guidelines, in Australia for example, suggest that older adults conduct physical activity of moderate intensity for 30 minutes on most, preferably all, days (Department of Health and Aged Care,  ). Problematically, only 28% of Australian adults aged over 65 years currently meet these guidelines (Australian Institute of Health Welfare,  ). It is well reported that exercise (aerobic, resistance or tai-chi) can improve cognition in older adults with and without cognitive decline (Snowden et al.,  ; Northey et al.,  ), particularly when combined with cognitive training (Cammisuli et al.,  ; Karssemeijer et al.,  ; Meng et al.,  ). Exercise is theorized to reduce cognitive deterioration risk through cerebrovascular improvements (Bliss et al.,  ), structural brain changes (Erickson et al.,  ; Bolandzadeh et al.,  ; ten Brink et al.,  ), and neural adaptations that stimulate neurogenesis and decrease cellular damage and pro-inflammatory responses (Vecchio et al.,  ). The functional brain changes associated with physical exercise in people experiencing cognitive decline that is associated with dementia risk are, however, less understood (Cui et al.,  ). \n\nFunctional brain measures can provide additional insights into the effects of exercise on the brain and cognitive function beyond that of structural brain measures (e.g., volumetric MRI; e.g., ten Brink et al.,  ), such as electrocortical (EEG, MEG, TMS), metabolic (PET, MRS), and cerebrovascular (fMRI, fNIRS, SPECT, ASL, TCD) activity (see  ; Steiner et al.,  ). Their application in exercise interventions in people with MCI has been growing, but with mixed effects being reported. For example, improvements in neuronal efficiency, as measured by fMRI, EEG, and PET, were identified in observational studies (Huang et al.,  ) while non-significant fMRI changes were found across RCTs (Ji et al.,  ). A systematic synthesis of RCTs is needed to understand the isolated effects of physical exercise on measures of cognition and brain function in people experiencing cognitive decline. \n  \nSearch strategy used to identify articles in EBSCOHost. \n  \nThe aim of this systematic review was to address the research question: \u201c  what are the study characteristics and effects of exercise interventions, on cognition and brain function in individuals with subjective or objective cognitive decline associated with dementia risk?\u201d   The findings from this review can further knowledge on the mechanisms by which physical activity interventions may exert previously reported positive effects on cognition and brain function in people with high dementia risk. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \nThis systematic review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022291843). The conduct and reporting of this systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). \n\n### 2.1. Eligibility criteria \n  \nTo formulate and refine the eligibility criteria and search strategy, a scoping review was performed. Existing literature was reviewed to identify the population, intervention, comparisons, outcome, and study design (PICOS) principles used in this systematic review. \n  \n Population:   Adults classified as having either subjective or objective cognitive impairment associated with dementia risk (e.g., SCD, MCI, VCI). \n  \n Intervention:   Any structured form of exercise (aerobic training, resistance\/strength training, mind-body exercises that involve movement) as the primary focus of the study. \n  \n Comparisons:   A control group consisting of a wait-list group, usual care, or inactive\/static exercise (e.g., stretching). \n  \n Outcomes:   Any validated assessment of cognition (e.g., Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE], Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) AND measure of brain function (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], electroencephalography [EEG], event-related potentials [ERPs], positron emission tomography [PET], functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]), cerebral blood flow [CBF], cerebral perfusion, transcranial Doppler [TCD], arterial spin labeling [ASL], magnetoencephalography [MEG], single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]). \n  \n Study designs:   Randomized controlled trial design of \u2265 4 weeks in duration to explore the effects of chronic exercise (Farrell and Turgeon,  ). \n  \nTo be eligible for inclusion, articles must have been peer-reviewed and published in English, without any limitation on publication year. Cognition and brain function assessments must have been conducted pre\/post intervention. Cognitive measures were deemed valid based on whether an appropriate citation for the assessment tool was provided within the reported study (as assessed in the methodological quality checklist described in Section 2.5). Measures of brain function specifically related to neuroimaging and physiological measurement modalities that quantify the functional activity of the brain including fMRI, EEG, MEG, PET, SPECT, fNIRS, TMS, MRS, TCD, and ASL. Studies only reporting structural brain measures (e.g., volumetric MRI, diffusion weighted imaging) were excluded. If a study involved multiple groups of the same exercise type (e.g., resistance training once\/week in group one and resistance training twice\/week in group two), the protocol that most closely adhered to current physical activity guidelines (Bull et al.,  ) was assessed further. Studies were excluded if: a full text could not be obtained or they were published in a format other than a journal article (e.g., review, book chapter, opinion article, thesis or editorial). Studies that did not measure the isolated effects of exercise were excluded (e.g., multimodal studies and exergaming), as were studies which included people with comorbid neurological (e.g., Parkinson's disease) or psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression). \n\n\n### 2.2. Systematic search strategy \n  \nWe conducted a search for articles published in EBSCOHost (indexing CINAHL Plus, SportDiscus, PsycINFO, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Ageline), Web of Science (indexing Web of Science Core Collection, Current Contents Collection, Chinese Science Citation Database, KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index) from inception to 10 March 2023. Search terms included words related to our PICOS.   shows the advanced search strategy used in EBSCOHost, which was adapted for the other database. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study selection and data extraction \n  \nAll retrieved study titles and abstracts were imported into COVIDENCE. Following the removal of duplicates, titles and abstracts were independently screened by two researchers (RC and NJM) and full texts of potentially relevant studies were obtained. The full texts of relevant studies were reviewed independently by three researchers (AS, GZS, and DK); this included the review of reference lists for potentially relevant articles. Study characteristics were extracted from the included articles by two researchers (VU and AB). Any disagreement about the selection of studies, or extraction of data, was resolved by discussion with one researcher (DK). Authors were contacted for additional information where needed. The following data were extracted from the studies: first author, publication year, location, study population, study design, number of participants (intervention and controls), cognitive decline or impairment classification criteria (if any), age (mean and SD), percentage of females included, and intervention characteristics (type, frequency, intensity [if reported], session duration, intervention duration), pre\/post-intervention cognitive outcome data (mean, SD), and summary of brain function findings (between- and within-group effects, and   p   values). Two researchers (DK and GZS) categorized domain-specific cognitive performance according to the Cattell-Horn-Carroll and Miyake framework (Webb et al.,  ), and consensus was reached with a third researcher (IHKL). \n\n\n### 2.4. Data synthesis \n  \nCognitive outcome data are presented as effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where data from \u22653 studies were available for a given cognitive domain, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3 software (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA). Significance was set at   p   < 0.05. Effect sizes were calculated from pre- to post-intervention scores between two groups for change in cognition outcomes such as global cognition, executive function, processing speed, and general short-term memory and expressed as Hedge's   g   with 95% CIs around the estimated effect size. Absolute between-study heterogeneity was calculated using tau (\u03c4). If post intervention scores were not available, the absolute or relative mean change scores were used to calculate effect sizes. Where there were two comparisons from the same study for a particular outcome (e.g., an aerobic exercise group and dancing group), the sample size of the control group was halved. \n\nStatistical heterogeneity between studies was quantified using Cochran's Q and   I   statistics, both of which provide estimates of the degree of heterogeneity resulting from between-study variance, rather than by chance. Cochran's Q with   p   < 0.05 was classified as significant heterogeneity, and   I   of more than 75% was considered to indicate high level heterogeneity,   I   of 25%\u221275% as indicative of substantial heterogeneity, and an   I   < 25% as low heterogeneity. Publication bias was tested using the Begg and Mazumdar test, with a   p   < 0.05 suggesting the presence of bias (Sterne et al.,  ). Where significant bias was detected, a Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill analysis (Duval and Tweedie,  ) was conducted to re-calculate the pooled effect size after removing any studies which may introduce publication bias (i.e., small studies with large effect sizes from the positive side of the funnel plot). Brain function effects were narratively analyzed due to heterogenous outcomes and insufficient data available for meta-analysis. \n\n\n### 2.5. Methodological quality \n  \nStudy quality was assessed independently by two researchers (TT and AB) using a modified Downs and Black checklist (Downs and Black,  ). Reporting quality is assessed with 10 items spanning the aims, participant characteristics, and findings; external validity is checked with 3 items concerning representativeness; internal validity for bias and confounding\/selection bias with 4 and 6 items respectively. The scale was modified to include criteria on exercise supervision, whereby if a study was supervised, a \u201cyes\u201d was given. If an item was unable to be determined a \u201cno\u201d was given. Scores were compared and disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (AS). \n\n\n### 2.6. Risk of bias \n  \nStudies were assessed for bias independently by two reviewers (TT and RLC) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (Sterne et al.,  ). Included studies were evaluated as having \u2018low,' \u2018high,' or \u2018unclear' risk of bias using the following domains: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of intervention instructors, blinding of participants, blinding of outcome assessors, handling of incomplete data, selective reporting, and other risk of bias pertaining to exercise adherence. Discrepancies in ratings were discussed and resolved with one additional reviewer (AS). Studies were not excluded based on their bias assessment. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study selection \n  \n represents the study selection process for this review. A total of 5,204 records were identified with 4,477 remaining after duplicates were removed. Fifteen articles met eligibility criteria for this systematic review, representing 12 unique interventions. \n  \nFlow chart of the study selection process. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Study characteristics \n  \nThe characteristics of the fifteen articles are shown in  . There were three multi-paper interventions: two articles reported on different brain function outcomes from the one intervention (Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), two papers reported on the same intervention outcomes at different time-points (Suo et al.,   for intervention effects; Broadhouse et al.,   for follow-up), and two publications reported on different aspects of the same brain function measure from the one intervention (Tao et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). As we were interested in intervention effects here, the follow-up findings from Broadhouse et al. were excluded from further analysis, but are reported in   for interested readers. Further, as Lin et al. and Tao et al. referred to the same sample between their studies, only Tao et al.'s data was used in the meta-analysis. All articles were published between 2012 and 2023, with five studies located in China, two each in Canada and Australia, and one each in Israel, Pakistan, Taiwan, United States of America, and South Korea. Nine of the twelve unique interventions employed a two-group parallel arm design and the remaining four trials involved three groups where two exercise-related interventions were compared to a control. \n  \nStudy characteristics of the 15 identified exercise trials in people with cognitive impairment associated with increased dementia risk. \n  \nMulti-paper study reporting on different brain function measures from the same intervention.

Participant characteristics \n  \nA total of 646 participants with cognitive frailty, MCI, or VCI were included and their baseline characteristics are summarized in  . For multi-paper interventions, the number of participants from the main study (i.e., Suo et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ) was used in the calculation for total participants included in this review. There were no studies involving people classified with SCD. \n\nPopulation classification criteria varied between the studies with published guidelines being used in all but one trial (Zhu et al.,  ), and a MoCA or MMSE cut-off score being used in all but two studies (Xia et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). MoCA cut-off scores were consistently applied at \u2264 26 while the MMSE cut-off was inconsistently used: <25 (Amjad et al.,  ), >20 (Hsu et al.,  ), >24 (Suo et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ). Mean age ranged from 58 to 78 years, and female representation in samples ranged from 38.4 to 100%. \n\n\n### 3.4. Intervention characteristics \n  \nThe last two columns of   summarize the exercise intervention characteristics and outcome measures relevant to this review. Of the nine two-arm trials, six employed aerobic exercise at a moderate intensity (Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), two used a resistance training protocol (Suo et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ), and one implemented the mind-body exercise of Baduajin (Lin et al.,  ). In the three-arm trials, aerobic and resistance training protocols were used in two studies (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ), while aerobic and mind-body exercise regimes were employed in the other two studies (Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Most interventions were compared to usual care or lifestyle, while three employed sham exercise (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ), and a further four involved a concurrent treatment of health education across all groups (Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Exercise frequency ranged from 2 to 3 sessions per week and intervention duration ranged from 6 to 24 weeks, with the most common being 24 weeks. \n\nSupervision was employed in all aerobic exercise trials, and this was conducted through walking (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ), dancing (Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ), or on a treadmill or stationary bicycle (Amjad et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ) for a duration of 20\u201360 minutes. Intensity varied between 60\u201390% of max HR (Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ) or 50\u201380% of HR reserve (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Resistance training protocols prescribed exercises at an intensity >65%1RM and adhered to the principles of progressive overload using an elastic band for 40 min (Hong et al.,  ) or a machine and free weights for 40\u201390 min (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). Three interventions employed the mind-body exercise of Baduanjin for 60 min, three times per week (Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Seven trials reported warm-up and cool-down periods lasting 5\u201310 min (Hong et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). \n\n\n### 3.5. Cognitive outcome measures and effects \n  \nAs shown in  , four cognitive domains were assessed across the included studies: global cognition (as measured by the MoCA, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog), executive function (most commonly assessed using Trail Making Test B), processing speed (most commonly measured with the Trail Making Test A), and general short-term memory (assessed with Digit Span measures). The pooled effects of exercise vs control groups for these cognitive outcomes are summarized in  . \n  \nDomain-specific cognitive performance outcomes of exercise and control groups from included trials. \n  \nAE, Aerobic Exercise; BDJ, Baduanjin; IRT, Incongruent trial Reaction Time; K-MoCA, Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment; N\/A, Not Available; RT, Resistance Training; TMT-A, Trail Making Test A; TMT-B, Trail Making Test B. \n    \nForest plot depicting effect of exercise versus control on global cognition, executive function, processing speed, and general short-term memory. \n  \n#### 3.5.1. Global cognition \n  \nEleven studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in global cognition (Suo et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium and significant improvement in global cognition (g = \u22120.417, 95% CI, \u22120.694 to \u22120.140,   p   = 0.003,   I   = 43.56%, \u03c4 =0.369, n =488). There was no indication of publication bias (p = 0.246). \n\n\n#### 3.5.2. Executive function \n  \nSix studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in executive function (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium and significant improvement in executive function (g = \u22120.391, 95% CI, \u22120.651to \u22120.131,   p   = 0.003,   I   = 13.28%, \u03c4 =0.185, n =273). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n#### 3.5.3. Processing speed \n  \nFour studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs control for change in processing speed (Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium but non-significant change in processing speed (g = \u22120.445, 95% CI, \u22120.929 to 0.040,   p   = 0.072,   I   = 64.11%, \u03c4 =0.441,   n   =198). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n#### 3.5.4. General short-term memory \n  \nFour studies reported sufficient data to determine the pooled effect of exercise vs. control for change in short-term memory performance (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). Exercise elicited a medium but non-significant improvement in short-term memory function (g = \u22120.412, 95% CI, \u22120.734 to 0.090,   p   = 0.012,   I   = 10.01%, \u03c4 =0.118,   n   =173). There was no indication of publication bias. \n\n\n\n### 3.6. Brain function \n  \n#### 3.6.1. fMRI \n  \nEight fMRI studies were identified, with three studies each assessing hemodynamic activity during cognitive tasks: associative memory (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), complex information processing (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), and flanker tasks (Hsu et al.,  ), and the other five utilizing an eyes closed resting state (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). \n\nIn an associative memory task (Nagamatsu et al.,  ), 6-months resistance training altered hemodynamic activity in the right lingual gyrus (  p   = 0.03), occipital-fusiform gyrus (  p   = 0.02), and right frontal pole (  p   = 0.03) during the encoding and recall of associations, when compared with the control group (direction of effects not reported). Hemodynamic changes in the right lingual gyrus correlated positively with memory performance (  r   = 0.51,   p   = 0.02); while aerobic training effects were comparable to the control group (Nagamatsu et al.,  ). During the encoding phase of another associative memory task, 16-weeks aerobic exercise increased BOLD activity in frontal regions including left inferior frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.001), left precentral gyrus (  p   =0.001), and left middle frontal gyrus (  p   =0.044) in people with amnestic MCI (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). There was also aerobic exercise-related enhanced response synchronization in the supramarginal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, insular cortices, anterior cingulate, precuneus and cuneus in their complex information processing paradigm (Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). In the flanker task (Hsu et al.,  ), 6-months aerobic training reduced activity in the left lateral occipital cortex (  p   < 0.03) and the right superior temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.03), relative to the control group. These reductions were significantly associated with faster reaction times on congruent trials (both   p   = 0.04). The decrease in superior temporal gyrus activity also correlated with better performance on incongruent trials (  p   = 0.05) (Hsu et al.,  ). \n\nOf the five resting state studies, one reported significant between-groups effects (Xia et al.,  ), with 24-weeks Baduanjin reducing functional connectivity in the right supramarginal inferior parietal and angular gyri, right rolandic operculum, right precuneus, and right fusiform gyrus when compared with the control group (all   p   < 0.05). Both exercise groups (Baduanjin and brisk walking) led to reduced functional connectivity in the right middle temporal gyrus relative to controls (all   p   \u2264 0.042). However, these functional connectivity changes were not associated with Stroop task performance (all   p   > 0.05). Another Baduanjin intervention study (Liu et al.,  ) assessing people with MCI found that 6-months training increased resting state functional connectivity from the right locus coeruleus and left ventral tegmental area to the right insula, right amygdala, and right anterior cingulate. The increased connectivity between the right locus coeruleus, the right insula (  r   =0.277,   p   =0.037), and the right anterior cingulate (  r   =0.265,   p   =0.046) were correlated with global cognitive performance (MoCA) (Liu et al.,  ). Progressive resistance training (Suo et al.,  ) for 6-months in people with MCI decreased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and both the left inferior temporal lobe and anterior cingulate cortex, and between the bilateral hippocampi and the right inferior temporal lobe (all   p   < 0.001). Functional connectivity was increased between the bilateral hippocampi and right middle frontal lobe (  p   =0.001). These changes in functional connectivity were not associated with the improvements in cognition observed with the resistance training intervention (Suo et al.,  ). \n\nWithin-group analyses in another study (Qi et al.,  ) showed that 3-months aerobic exercise increased the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in bilateral fronto-temporal, entorhinal, anterior cingulate and parahippocampal cortices (all   p   < 0.05); whereas controls exhibited increased ALFF in the right temporal and posterior cingulate cortex (  p   < 0.05). These changes in ALFF were not related to cognitive test performance. Another sub-study (Tao et al.,  ) from the trial assessing 24-weeks Baduanjin training in people with cognitive frailty found that Baduanjin training led to significant ALFF reductions in the right hippocampus (classic low-frequency band 0.01\u20130.08 Hz) and increases in the bilateral anterior cingulate (slow-5 band 0.010\u20130.027 Hz); these were linked with MoCA score changes (hippocampus:   r   = \u22120.291,   p   =0.036; anterior cingulate:   r   =0.309,   p   =0.025). \n\n\n#### 3.6.2. Electrophysiology \n  \nFour studies examined electrophysiological activity (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). There were two EEG studies identified, with neuronal activity assessed in the delta to beta band ranges during alternating eyes closed and open states in one study (Amjad et al.,  ) and eyes closed in the second study (Hong et al.,  ). Relative eyes closed resting state power in delta and alpha-2 were lower, beta-1 was higher, and EEG complexity (approximate entropy) increased after 6-weeks (18 sessions) aerobic exercise compared with controls (all   p   < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the eyes-open condition (Amjad et al.,  ). In the second study, relative theta power in the frontal-left region decreased, while relative alpha power in the temporal-left region increased with 12-weeks resistance training as compared to the control group (both   p   < 0.05) (Hong et al.,  ). \n\nTwo ERP studies were found (Zhu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). In the one auditory task ERP study of people with MCI (task details not described; Zhu et al.,  ) that assessed P300 component amplitudes and latencies, 3-months of aerobic exercise (dancing) reduced P300 component latency relative to controls, and this effect was sustained at the 6-month follow-up (both   p   < 0.05). In the second ERP study (Tsai et al.,  ), 16-weeks exercise in people with amnestic MCI increased P3 amplitudes from a visual task switching paradigm following both aerobic (  p   < 0.001) and resistance training (  p   = 0.013) compared to controls. \n\n\n#### 3.6.3. Cerebral blood flow \n  \nTwo studies assessed cerebral blood flow (Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). Tomoto et al. ( ) measured cerebral blood flow with transcranial doppler in people with MCI. Following 12-months aerobic exercise training, internal carotid arterial flow (  p   = 0.023) and normalized cerebral blood flow (  p   = 0.006) increased, and in the middle cerebral artery, diastolic cerebral blood flow velocity (  p   = 0.020) increased, and pulsatility index deceased (  p   =0.030). These changes were not associated with cognitive performance (Tomoto et al.,  ). \n\nThe 24-week trial of Baduanjin in people with cognitive frailty (Lin et al.,  ) led to increased blood flow velocity in the right middle cerebral artery and basilar artery, and increased end diastolic velocity to the basilar artery; with a decrease reported for the control group (all   p   < 0.023). Reductions in peak systolic velocity in the bilateral middle cerebral artery were observed for both Baduanjin training and the control group (all   p   < 0.045); these were lower for controls. Correlations with cognitive function were not explored (Lin et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### 3.7. Methodological quality \n  \nThe results of the methodological quality assessment are presented in  . The scores ranged from 13\u201320, with an average of 16.9. Seven studies were classified as being of moderate quality (Hong et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), and one was considered to be of high quality (Hsu et al.,  ). All studies did not blind their intervention groups due to the nature of the exercise trials. Most articles (  n   = 11) adequately reported their aims, outcomes, patient characteristics, interventions,   p  -values, and variabilities. \n  \nResults of the modified methodological quality assessment (Downs and Black,  ). \n    \nSix trials reported the adherence to exercise sessions, with an average adherence rate of \u226554% (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Furthermore, all included trials provided supervised exercise sessions. Three studies reported adverse effects, which included acute episodes of shortness of breath and non-injurious falls in one study (Nagamatsu et al.,  ), and no adverse effects in the other studies (Zhu et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ). Seven studies reported attempted to blind those measuring cognitive outcomes of the exercise interventions (Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). \n\n\n### 3.8. Risk of bias \n  \nThe results of the risk of bias assessment are summarized in  . Five studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on six or more domains (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hong et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ). Two studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on five domains (Qi et al.,  ; Yogev-Seligmann et al.,  ), while six studies scored an unclear or high risk of bias on four or less domains (Suo et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Tomoto et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ). \n  \nRisk of bias assessment summary. \n  \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate exercise interventions for effects on cognition and brain function in adults with cognitive impairment. As evidenced by our screening outcomes (see  ), this literature base was rather limited and is considerably novel, with fifteen articles identified and thirteen of these being published within the last 4 years (since 2018). All but two studies included people with MCI (Hsu et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ) and all but one referred to published guidelines in their classification criteria (Nagamatsu et al.,  ). No studies involving people with SCD met eligibility criteria. Intervention protocols mostly involved moderate intensity aerobic exercise and were conducted 2\u20133 times per week for up to 40 MIN per session. Most studies assessed global cognition using the MoCA and executive functions through the Trail Making Test B, with most brain function assessments conducted using fMRI. \n\n### 4.1. Exercise and cognition \n  \nAccording to our analyses, exercise leads to moderate and significant improvements in global cognitive and executive functions, and these are driven by interventions of aerobic nature. The cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise (high- and low-frequency) have been reported in previous meta-analyses and reviews extending to those who have AD and non-AD dementias, MCI, and SCD (Baker et al.,  ; Groot et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ; Cammisuli et al.,  ). Studies utilizing strength-based exercise for cognition in older adults, however, are lacking. Only four studies included in this meta-analysis employed resistance strength-based training. Further, none of the studies explored the effects of resistance training on processing speed. Reduced muscular strength has been associated with advancing age (Lauretani et al.,  ), greater brain atrophy, white matter disease, and poorer cognitive function (Clark and Taylor,  ; Kilgour et al.,  ; Herold et al.,  ). \n\nGrowing evidence shows that resistance exercise evokes meaningful benefits in functional brain changes (particularly the frontal lobe), reductions in white matter lesions and decreased atrophy across age-groups (Herold et al.,  ). For example, in older sedentary males, a 6-month study presented that resistance training improved memory performance (Cassilhas et al.,  ). In community-dwelling older women, progressive resistance exercise significantly improved executive function by up to 12.6% (Liu-Ambrose et al.,  ). Further, at 2-year follow-up within that same cohort, both bi-weekly and weekly resistance exercise increased peak muscle power, maintained executive functions, promoted memory, and reduced white matter atrophy (Best et al.,  ). \n\nIn an MCI population that compared progressive resistance training (PRT) with computerized cognitive training (CCT), the authors found that the PRT but not CCT significantly increased gray matter in the posterior cingulate, reduced white matter hyperintensity, and improved global cognition at 6-months follow-up (Suo et al.,  ). From our analyses, pooled effects for short-term memory were moderate, but non-significant. However, these marginal improvements in short-term memory seem to be driven by resistance training, rather than aerobic exercises, which has not been reported elsewhere. Together, this suggests that resistance exercise has cognitive benefits independent of aerobic exercise. Previous research has demonstrated plausible biological mechanisms involving homocysteine and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Liu-Ambrose and Donaldson,  ). As an interesting aside, it has been claimed by an older meta-analysis that the greatest benefits on cognition in older adults could occur when aerobic exercise was combined with resistance training (Colcombe and Kramer,  ). Regardless, more clinical trials examining the role of resistance strength-based exercise independently or combined with aerobic exercises are required to explore the maximal benefits on cognitive functions and associated physiological changes. \n\n\n### 4.2. Exercise and brain function \n  \nRegional differences throughout the brain were reported across studies utilizing fMRI to assess central mechanisms of exercise, with few commonalities (in study design and subsequently results), making synthesis of results challenging. Task-based fMRI assessments revealed exercise-related changes in distinct brain areas, with two of the three studies respectively correlating right lingual gyrus and superior temporal gyrus changes with improved cognitive performance (Nagamatsu et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ). The most pronounced resting state changes observed were in the temporal lobes, with 12\u201326 weeks of aerobic, resistance, and mind-body exercises altering the hippocampal region (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ). While most studies found non-significant correlations between the regional changes in brain activity and cognitive performance (Suo et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ), improved MoCA scores were associated with Baduanjin-related changes in resting state anterior cingulate activity (Tao et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). These findings are likely due to increased regional metabolic activity (Shimada et al.,  ) and may reflect exercise-induced neuroplastic changes as observed in other populations (Woodward et al.,  ), potentially providing a buffer against pathophysiological and age-related atrophy (Bugg and Head,  ) in these vulnerable regions. \n\nIn AD, the resting state EEG signature is dominated by slow wave activity (i.e., increased delta and theta magnitude) and reduced fast wave activity (alpha and beta magnitude) (Babiloni et al.,  ), and a similar pattern has been reported in MCI (Meghdadi et al.,  ) (albeit less consistently), particularly those who have an increased risk of AD (Jelic et al.,  ). However, in healthy aging, the opposite is observed, that is, reduced delta and theta spectral power (Vlahou et al.,  ; Barry and De Blasio,  ). Across included studies, 12\u201316 weeks of exercise (both aerobic and resistance) led to reduced delta and theta power in MCI (Hong et al.,  ; Amjad et al.,  ), potentially indicating a normalization of the EEG spectra and a shift away from the AD trajectory. Exercise differentially modulated alpha, with aerobic training reducing alpha-2 power (11\u201314 Hz) (Amjad et al.,  ) and resistance training increasing broad-band alpha (8\u201312 Hz) power (Hong et al.,  ). Hong's finding may have more therapeutic relevance here given that reduced alpha power (and peak frequency) is reported in MCI\/AD, and the wider alpha range may have detected this. Further, aerobic exercise appears to promote neural adaptability that is measurable at a global scale. Aerobic exercise increased EEG complexity (Amjad et al.,  ), a signal proposed to reflect the underlying integrity of neuronal circuitry and its capacity to rapidly adapt to environmental changes (Bosl et al.,  ). This is further reflected in the ERP effects of aerobic and resistance exercise whereby reduced P300 latency and increased P300 amplitude indicated faster stimulus evaluation processing and enhanced neurocognitive efficiency (Steiner et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tsai et al.,  ). \n\nIncreased CBF has been suggested as a potential mechanism underpinning the positive effects of exercise on cognitive function (Renke et al.,  ). The exact reason for this is less clear but these effects may arise from the association between neuronal metabolism and CBF and perfusion (i.e., neurovascular coupling), changes in cerebral blood vessels including elasticity and density (i.e., angiogenesis), and enhanced activity of pericytes (Bolduc et al.,  ; Barnes et al.,  ). From the two CBF studies identified in this review, aerobic exercise was found to increase blood flow velocity in the internal carotid artery (Tomoto et al.,  ), right middle cerebral and basilar arteries (Lin et al.,  ), and end diastolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Tomoto et al.,  ) and basilar artery (Lin et al.,  ). In the middle cerebral artery, reductions were also seen in pulsatility (Tomoto et al.,  ) and peak systolic velocity (Lin et al.,  ). No associations were found with cognitive function were found in the one study that assessed for them (Tomoto et al.,  ) so we are currently unable to infer whether these changes in arterial CBF are associated with cognitive improvements related to exercise. \n\n\n### 4.3. Limitations \n  \nA small number of studies met eligibility criteria pertaining to intervention characteristics and outcome measures, limiting the implications of this review. Most notably, there were no SCD studies. This is unsurprising given that classification criteria were operationalized in 2017 (Molinuevo et al.,  ), just as brain function measures emerged as outcomes of interest in exercise trials. This limited the scope of our review, its findings, and implications to objective classifications of cognitive impairment, which are respectively considered to represent the prodromal stages of AD and vascular dementia. These findings were also hindered by the small sample sizes, lack of reported adherence to exercise sessions (and where this was reported in two studies, the average adherence rate was 75%), moderate methodological quality, and high risk of bias in most included studies. We also did not exclude studies based on intervention from any pooled analysis. The pooled analyses were undertaken to determine the effect of exercise per se (which can include aerobic exercise or resistance training), to maximize the sample size. Further studies can explore the relative effects of individual exercise prescription variables such as modality, intensity, and volume. These review outcomes speak to the paucity and novelty of brain function research regarding exercise for dementia prevention. Any neuronal mechanistic inferences regarding exercise and cognition are thus speculative. \n\n\n### 4.4. Conclusion \n  \nAs reviewed here, exercise can significantly improve global cognitive and executive functions in people with cognitive impairment and increased dementia risk. Regardless of modality (aerobic, resistance, or mind-body), at least 12 weeks of exercise can reverse brain activity signatures of cognitive decline in people with cognitive impairment. We speculate that the cognitive improvements associated with exercise are likely driven by increased metabolic activity, cerebrovascular mechanisms (such as neurovascular coupling), and neuroplasticity throughout the brain, but particularly in highly sensitive and plastic regions in the frontal and temporal lobes. These hypotheses require further investigation with higher quality randomized controlled trials.   integrates these central impacts of exercise alongside other functional changes together with molecular and physiological mechanisms established in prior reviews (mentioned in the introduction), highlighting the multitargeting effects of exercise for dementia risk reduction. As the field of dementia prevention grows, we encourage researchers to include more clinical trials investigating the role of resistance strength-based exercise independently or combined with aerobic exercises in this at-risk population. This is to identify the maximal benefits of different exercise regimes on cognition and physiological changes. Furthermore, as highlighted here, future research should integrate both cognitive and brain function measures to help elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the positive effects of exercise. \n  \nPositive effects of aerobic, resistance and mind-body exercise on functional (body and brain), physiological and molecular mechanisms that may reduce dementia risk. \n  \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nDK, AS, and GS-L conceptualized the study.

{"text":"Arioli, Maria and Cattaneo, Zaira and Parimbelli, Simone and Canessa, Nicola\nSoc Cogn Affect Neurosci, 2023\n\n# Title\n\nRelational vs representational social cognitive processing: a coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data\n\n# Keywords\n\nrelational\nrepresentational\nmentalizing\naction observation\ntemporo-parietal junction\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThe neurocognitive bases of social cognition have been framed in terms of representing others\u2019 actions through the mirror system and their mental states via the mentalizing network. Alongside representing another person\u2019s actions or mental states, however, social cognitive processing is also shaped by their (mis)match with one\u2019s own corresponding states. Here, we addressed the distinction between representing others\u2019 states through the action observation or mentalizing networks (i.e.\u00a0representational processing) and detecting the extent to which such states align with one\u2019s own ones (i.e.\u00a0relational processing, mediated by social conflict). We took a meta-analytic approach to unveil the neural bases of both relational and representational processing by focusing on previously reported brain activations from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using false-belief and action observation tasks. Our findings suggest that relational processing for belief and action states involves, respectively, the left and right temporo-parietal junction, likely contributing to self-other differentiation. Moreover, distinct sectors of the posterior fronto-medial cortex support social conflict processing for belief and action, possibly through the inhibition of conflictual representations. These data might pave the way for further studies addressing social conflict as an important component of normal and pathological processing, and inform the design of rehabilitative treatments for social deficits. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA core topic in social cognitive neuroscience concerns the role of the mirror and mentalizing brain networks ( ;  ;  ) in understanding others\u2019 behaviours   \u00a0   and decoding their intentions and feelings ( ,  ;  ;  ). Notably, these networks are generally considered to underpin a neural basis for representing these different components of social understanding. \n\nThe mirror network includes inferior frontal, premotor and inferior parietal regions which are activated both when performing an action and when observing the same action performed by someone else ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This direct matching between action execution and observation is considered to underpin a variety of social functions mediated by a mental representation of another\u2019s actions , such as recognition ( ), imitation learning ( ;  ) and the decoding of intentions signalled by visuomotor and\/or contextual cues ( ;  ). The mentalizing system, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the medial precuneus\/posterior cingulate cortex and the temporal poles ( ;  ), is rather activated when\u2014in the lack of informative visuomotor cues\u2014others\u2019 intentions must be inferred in terms of mental states such as thoughts and beliefs ( ). Importantly, the use of different terms such as \u2018theory of mind\u2019, \u2018mentalizing\u2019, \u2018mind-reading\u2019 or \u2018perspective-taking\u2019\u2014typically associated with partly overlapping and partly different meanings\u2014has generated some confusion in the related literature ( ;  ). We therefore chose to use only the term \u2018mentalizing\u2019, that has been associated primarily with the results of neuroimaging studies aimed at characterizing the brain regions involved in representing and understanding others\u2019 mental states (i.e.\u00a0a \u2018mentalizing\u2019 network, e.g.  ). \n\nAlong with representing others\u2019 intentional states, however, evaluating whether they (mis)match with our own ones might represent another crucial prerequisite for effective social communication and interactions. This distinction has been recently conceptualized between representing others\u2019 intentions (be it in terms of mental states or actions), i.e.\u00a0representational processing, and detecting the extent to which such representation is (mis)matching with our own state, i.e.\u00a0relational processing based on monitoring a \u2018social conflict\u2019, i.e.\u00a0a conflict\/mismatch between self- and other-related actions or states ( ). \n\nWell before this proposal, however, both representational and relational processing had been implemented in neuroimaging studies with either actions or mental states (e.g., beliefs) as \u2018target\u2019 stimuli. \n\nIn the former case, studies addressing action representation typically compared conditions depicting another\u2019s action   vs   no visible human movement (e.g. scrambled images or object mechanical movements), without action execution ( ;  ). In contrast, studies of action conflict monitoring contrasted conditions eliciting misalignment between performed and attended actions (socially incongruent condition) with conditions in which a same action is both executed and observed (socially congruent condition) ( ;  ;  ). \n\nIn the case of mentalizing, most neuroimaging studies used false-belief tasks requiring to make inferences on another\u2019s mental states   vs   non-mental (e.g. physical) events ( ;  ). Notably, the \u2018false-belief\u2019 and \u2018true-belief\u2019 conditions of this task implicitly elicit, respectively, mismatching (socially incongruent condition) and matching (socially congruent condition) representations across the subject and the story character. While comparing these conditions should thus unveil the regions involved in belief conflict monitoring ( ;  ), this contrast is rather commonly interpreted in terms of mental representation (e.g.  ). In \u2018false-belief\u2019 conditions, the mismatch between one\u2019s own and the other\u2019s knowledge is supposed to prompt the construction of her\/his model of the world, i.e.\u00a0mentalizing ( ), rather than supporting the processing of social conflict. Interpreting results under a relational (i.e.\u00a0social conflict), rather than representational, framework might thus help characterizing mechanisms of social cognition that are shared across different social domains, such as action perception and belief understanding, as well as during moral decision-making and understanding of irony, lies and humour ( ). For example, the appreciation of irony and sarcasm may emerge from the interplay between the social verbal cues given by others and the world as interpreted by oneself, rather than reflecting other\u2019s mental-state representation   per se   ( ). \n\nOn this basis, it has been suggested that assessing the correspondence between another\u2019s and our own model of the world might represent the crucial process, providing the most critical information, for social understanding ( ). The latter, and more generally human communication, may depend more on assessing how well one\u2019s knowledge aligns with others\u2019 knowledge than on inferring their mental states. A failure in processing the difference between one\u2019s own and others\u2019 lines of thought might thus be expected to result in social impairments. An ideal benchmark for this hypothesis is represented by autism spectrum disorder, in which social deficits might reflect altered mechanisms of social conflict monitoring rather than difficulties in representing others\u2019 minds, i.e. \u2018mindblindness\u2019 (e.g.  ). This view fits with the observation of TPJ\u2014in which altered activity has been previously reported in autism ( ;  )\u2014as the common neural basis of mechanisms for monitoring social conflicts conveyed both by action perception ( ) and belief understanding ( ). Moreover, neuromodulation of TPJ activity has been shown to influence social conflict monitoring ( ;  ), but not representational measures of actions or mental states ( ;  ). \n\nSome studies, however, failed to report a specific TPJ involvement in social conflict monitoring when comparing false and true-belief conditions ( ;  ) or socially incongruent and congruent conditions in the action\u2013perception domain ( ). Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that social conflict monitoring involves regions other than the TPJ, such as the insula for action perception ( ;  ) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) for both action observation ( ) and false belief ( ). Therefore, the putative exclusive role of TPJ in social conflict monitoring ( ;  ) needs further supporting evidence. A related gap concerns the proposal of TPJ as a \u2018relational\u2019 hub common to distinct social\u2013cognitive domains, possibly receiving input from the motor cortex   vs   areas underlying mental representations when monitoring action conflict   vs   belief conflict, respectively ( ). \n\nOn this basis, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies with false-belief and action observation tasks to investigate the specific and\/or overlapping neural bases of (i) representational processing and (ii) relational processing based on social conflict monitoring. Available evidence (e.g.  ) suggests an involvement of TPJ both for belief and action conflict monitoring. According to   hypothesis, a prominent engagement of TPJ in relational, instead of representational, processing would support a reframing of mentalizing (and probably also other social\u2013cognitive domains) in terms of relational rather than representational processing. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Rationale of the meta-analytic approach \n  \nWe aimed to identify the brain regions consistently associated with relational processing (i.e.\u00a0social conflict monitoring), over and beyond its requirements in terms of representational processing ( ), by focusing on false-belief ( ) and action observation ( ) tasks, respectively. We first pursued this goal with activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a coordinate-based meta-analytic approach using coordinates of peak locations to summarize and integrate published findings ( ). This approach allows to overcome the typical limitations inherent in single neuroimaging experiments, e.g.\u00a0sensitivity to experimental and\/or analytic procedures, lack of replication studies and small sample sizes ( ). These constraints are known to increase the likelihood of false negatives ( ), thus pushing researchers towards procedures that, conversely, might promote false positives ( ;  ). \n\nWe first ran four separate ALE analyses addressing the neural processing of belief relational, belief representation, action relational and action representation processes in healthy individuals. Subsequent conjunction and contrast analyses unveiled both common and specific activations across (i) belief relational and belief representation, (ii) action relational and action representation and (iii) belief relational and action relational processing. We did not perform comparison\/conjunction analyses of belief and action representational processing because they would not fit our purpose of clarifying the neural bases of relational (  vs   representational) processing. \n\nAll the inclusion criteria for each dataset were selected by the first author and then checked and approved by the other authors. This procedure, entailing a double check by independent investigators, was aimed to reduce the chances of a selection bias ( ). The selection process began in September 2020. M.A and S.P. independently screened the papers for the meta-analyses on false belief and action observation, respectively, and weekly meetings were scheduled to resolve doubts. To further improve the quality of the selection process, at the end of this first selection stage, the two authors exchanged their databases for a cross-check. Finally, the two databases were also checked and approved by the other two authors (Z.C. and N.C.). \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \n#### Neural bases of belief representation and belief relational processing. \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( ;  ) and the guidelines for neuroimaging meta-analysis ( ), we started our survey of the relevant literature by searching for \u2018false-belief fMRI\u2019 on PubMed ( ; research date: 24 August 2021) and by constraining this search to studies on human subjects and written in English. Additional records were identified by searching for \u2018fMRI \u201cfalse-belief task\u201d\u2019 on Google Scholar ( ; research date: 24 August 2021). In the latter search, we used quotation marks to retrieve only papers reporting the \u2018false-belief task\u2019 in the text. While the search was limited to papers written in English, we did not apply temporal filters (e.g. specific years of publication). After duplicate removal, a preliminary pool of 2013 studies was first screened by titles and then by abstracts. We retained only those studies fulfilling the following selection criteria (see\u00a0  for details on the procedure for study selection): \n  \nPRISMA flowchart of literature search and selection process for false-belief task \n    \nStudies written in the English language. \n  \nEmpirical fMRI studies, while excluding review and meta-analysis studies and those employing other techniques, to ensure comparable spatial and temporal resolution. \n  \nStudies reporting whole-brain activation coordinates, rather than regions of interest (ROIs) or results of small-volume correction (SVC). Studies based on ROIs or SVC must be excluded because a prerequisite for fMRI meta-analyses is that convergence across experiments is tested against a null hypothesis of random spatial associations across the entire brain under the assumption that each voxel has the same a priori chance of being activated ( ;  ). \n  \nStudies including drug-free and non-clinical participants to prevent possible differences in brain activity associated with pharmacological manipulations or neuro-psychiatric diseases other than those under investigation. \n  \nStudies with adult subjects (age range: 18\u201360\u2009years). \n  \nA minimum of five participants included in the final analyses, as usually advised for neuroimaging meta-analyses (e.g.  ). \n  \nStudies using the false-belief task to investigate the neural bases of making inferences on another\u2019s beliefs. We selected only studies performing either of these contrasts or both: \n  \nInferences on \u2018true belief > inferences on physical or perceptual aspects\u2019 and inferences on \u2018false belief > inferences on physical or perceptual aspect\u2019. While the first contrast allows to isolate belief representation, the latter contrast leads to the inclusion of studies using \u2018false belief\u2019 as a target condition that entails not only representing another mind but also representing the self-other distinction and social conflict. Importantly, most of the published studies with \u2018false belief\u2019 as a target condition used the \u2018false photograph\u2019 as a control condition in which subjects are required to represent the outdated content of a physical representation such as a photograph. The rationale for choosing this control is that it makes the target and control conditions structurally equivalent (including for the presence of conflict) and differing for their requirements in terms of processing mental states. Importantly, however, there is no evidence that this condition with perceptual conflict can control for social conflict. \n  \nThis selection, however, retained studies contrasting belief and non-belief conditions, while excluding studies in which beliefs were contrasted with low-level baseline conditions such as rest or visual fixation. \n  \nStudies using these contrasts to unveil the neural bases of representing another\u2019s mental states were included in the \u2018belief representational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nInferences on another\u2019s false-belief (socially incongruent\/mismatching condition, in which the other person\u2019s mental representation of the situation differs from the participant\u2019s own belief)\u2009>\u2009inferences on another\u2019s true-belief (socially congruent condition, in which the participant\u2019s and another\u2019s beliefs match with each other). Studies using this contrast to isolate the regions engaged in processing the social conflict that is present only in the false-belief condition were included in the \u2018belief relational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n    \nStudies not reporting some of the required information (e.g. participants\u2019 number or age, or coordinates for contrasts of interest) were excluded. Starting from an initial screening of 2013 titles and abstracts, 109 papers deemed as potentially relevant were fully reviewed based on the aforementioned selection criteria\u00a0( ). We thus excluded: 3 review\/meta-analysis articles; 6 studies using ROIs or SVC; 3 studies focused on children or ageing populations; 30 studies focusing on other topics or using inappropriate contrasts; 8 studies focused on clinical populations; 14 studies employing techniques other than fMRI and 5 studies not reporting all the required information. This selection phase resulted in a final set of 40 studies fulfilling our selection criteria. \n\nWe then expanded our search for other potentially relevant studies by carefully examining both the studies quoting, and those quoted by, each of these papers, alongside previously published review and meta-analysis papers on similar topics ( ;  ). This second phase highlighted six further studies fitting our search criteria. Studies were classified as \u2018relational mentalizing\u2019 if they required participants to infer a belief conflict and \u2018representational mentalizing\u2019 if they involved belief understanding. Overall, this procedure led to include in the ALE \u2018belief representational\u2019 meta-analysis 33 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 34 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 769 subjects and 405 activation foci. Instead, the ALE \u2018belief relational\u2019 meta-analysis included 17 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 17 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 323 subjects and 202 activation foci. \n\n\n#### Neural bases of action representation and action relational processing. \n  \nWe started our survey of the relevant literature by searching for \u2018action observation fMRI\u2019 on PubMed ( ; research date: 24 August 2021) and by constraining this search to studies on human subjects and written in English. Additional records were identified by searching for \u2018fMRI \u201caction observation task\u201d\u2019 on Google Scholar ( ; research date: 24 August 2021). In the latter search, we used quotation marks to retrieve only papers reporting \u2018action observation task\u2019. While the search was limited to papers written in English, we did not apply temporal filters (e.g. specific years of publication). After duplicate removal, a preliminary pool of 1862 studies was first screened by titles and then by abstracts\u00a0( ). While the methodological selection criteria were the same as mentioned earlier ((i)\u2013(vi)), here we selected only studies addressing action observation tasks with either of these contrasts or both: \n  \nPRISMA flowchart of literature search and selection process for action observation tasks. \n    \nAction observation\u2009>\u2009control condition with no visible human action (e.g. objects movement, static pictures of humans or scrambled images), without action execution. This selection retained studies contrasting the visual processing of human actions and complex non-human action stimuli while excluding studies in which actions were contrasted with low-level baseline conditions such as rest or visual fixation. Studies using this contrast to unveil the neural bases of representing observed actions were included in the \u2018action representational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nSocially incongruent action (when there is a mismatch between the action performed by the participants and the one that they observe being performed by someone else)\u2009>\u2009socially congruent action (when the participants\u2019 action is identical to the observed one). Importantly, this comparison is not directly informative about whether the individual represents the other\u2019s action, as the difference between the two conditions refers to a mismatch (i.e.\u00a0social conflict) between the participant\u2019s and other\u2019s actions, and not to a particular action as such. Studies using this type of contrast were included in the \u2018action relational\u2019 meta-analysis. \n  \nStarting from an initial screening of 1862 titles and abstracts, 520 papers deemed as potentially relevant were fully reviewed based on the aforementioned selection criteria\u00a0( ). We thus excluded: 19 review or meta-analysis articles; 27 studies employing techniques other than fMRI; 47 studies using ROIs or SVC; 24 studies focused on children or ageing populations; 30 studies not reporting all the required information; 305 studies focusing on other topics or using inappropriate contrasts, and 13 studies focused on clinical populations. This selection phase resulted in 55 studies fulfilling our selection criteria. \n\nWe then expanded our search for other potentially relevant studies by carefully examining both the studies quoting, and those quoted by, each of these papers, alongside previously published meta-analyses on the neural bases of action observation processing ( ;  ;  ;  ). This second phase highlighted 11 further studies fitting our search criteria. Studies were classified as \u2018relational action processing\u2019 if they required participants to monitor an action conflict and \u2018representational action processing\u2019 if they involved action perception. Overall, this procedure led to include in the ALE \u2018action representational\u2019 meta-analysis 51 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 52 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 933 subjects and 1006 activation foci. Instead, the ALE \u2018action relational\u2019 meta-analysis included 15 previously published studies ( ), resulting from 15 experiments (individual comparisons reported) with 308 subjects and 194 activation foci. \n\n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe performed four ALE analyses, using the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ), to identify regions consistently associated with (i) belief representational processing, (ii) belief relational processing, (iii) action representational processing and (iv) action relational processing. We followed the analytic procedure previously described by   and  , based on  . Importantly, the inclusion of multiple contrasts\/experiments from the same set of subjects can generate dependence across experiment maps and thus decrease the validity of meta-analytic results. To prevent this issue, for each meta-analysis we adjusted for within-group effects by pooling the coordinates from all the relevant contrasts of a study into one experiment ( ). The number of experiments included in most of these meta-analyses is in line with the recent prescriptions for ALE ( ;  ), suggesting a minimum of 17 experiments to ensure that results would not be driven by single experiments ( ). Only the analysis on action relational processing included less than 17 experiments (i.e. 15). However, this numerosity is in line with   and   meta-analyses on social processing in healthy individuals. \n\nIn all meta-analyses, activation foci were initially interpreted as the centres of three-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions to capture the spatial uncertainty associated with each individual coordinate. All coordinates were reported in the MNI space or converted into this space using the automatic routine implemented in GingerALE. The three-dimensional probabilities of all activation foci in a given experiment were then combined for each voxel, resulting in a modelled activation (MA) map. The union of these maps produces ALE scores describing the convergence of results at each brain voxel ( ). To distinguish \u2018true\u2019 convergence across studies from random convergence (i.e. noise), the ALE scores are compared with an empirically defined null distribution ( ). The latter reflects a random spatial association between experiments, with the within-experiment distribution of foci being treated as a fixed property. A random-effects inference is thus invoked by focusing on the above-chance convergence between different experiments and not on the clustering of foci within a specific experiment. From a computational standpoint, deriving this null hypothesis involved sampling a voxel at random from each MA map and taking the union of the resulting values. The ALE score obtained under this assumption of spatial independence was recorded, and the permutation procedure was iterated 1000 times to obtain a sufficient sample of the ALE null distribution. The \u2018true\u2019 ALE scores were tested against the ALE scores obtained under the null distribution and thresholded at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, corrected for cluster-level family-wise error, and the cluster-level threshold was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.01 to identify the above-chance convergence in each analysis. \n\nThe resulting maps were then fed into direct comparisons and conjunction analyses, within GingerALE, to unveil the common and specific brain activations across (i) belief representation and belief relational, (ii) action representation and action relational, and (iii) belief relational and action relational processing. \n\nFor each comparison, a conjunction image was created, using the voxel-wise minimum value of the included ALE images, to display the similarity between datasets ( ). In the same analysis, two ALE contrast images were created and compared by directly subtracting one input image from the other. To correct for sampling errors, GingerALE creates such data by pooling the foci in each dataset and randomly dividing them into two new groupings equivalent in size to the original datasets. An ALE image is created for each new dataset, then subtracted from the other and compared with the true data. Permutation calculations are then used to compute a voxel-wise   P  -value image indicating where the values of the \u2018true data\u2019 fall within the distribution of values in any single voxel. To simplify the interpretation of ALE contrast images, significant ALE subtraction scores were converted to Z scores. For contrast analyses, we used a threshold set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, using 10\u2009000 permutations, and a minimum volume size of 100 mm . \n\nAnatomical labelling of all clusters was automatically generated by GingerALE ( ). Moreover, we used the Statistical Parametric Mapping Anatomy Toolbox (v.2.2c;  ), as well as the AAL template (as implemented in MRIcron;  ) and Neurosynth ( ), to double-check these localizations. \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nThe generalizability of coordinate-based meta-analyses is hampered by the exclusion of studies that are not published, typically due to the lack of statistically significant findings. We took two distinct approaches to assure the robustness of our ALE meta-analytic findings against such publication bias (i.e.\u00a0the higher likelihood of positive, compared with negative, findings to be reported). Namely, we calculated (i) the relationship between number of participants and number of significant findings reported (e.g. foci detected) ( ,  ;  ), and (ii) for each cluster of each meta-analysis, the fail-safe number (FSN) ( ). \n\nThe rationale for the former approach is that a negative correlation between sample size and number of foci is typical of analyses with publication bias, where studies with small samples are published only if their results match a priori hypotheses ( ). Against this possible confound, for none of the performed ALE meta-analyses we observed a significant negative correlation between sample size and number of foci [action relational:   r  (13)\u2009=\u20090.504,   P  \u2009=\u20090.055; action representation:   r  (50)\u2009=\u20090.069,   P  \u2009=\u20090.628; belief relational:   r  (15)\u2009=\u20090.092,   P  \u2009=\u20090.617; belief representational:   r  (32)\u2009=\u20090.158,   P  \u2009=\u20090.373]. \n\nWe additionally carried out an FSN analysis ( ) to further ensure the robustness of our findings against unpublished studies with null results in the \u2018file drawer\u2019 (e.g. driven by a bias towards publishing positive results). This approach entails investigating the effect of adding null-result experiments (i.e.\u00a0null studies) to the original database of studies included in the meta-analysis ( ). Null-result experiments were created in R 3.6.1 ( ), using   R code and guidelines to match the real experiments in terms of sample size and number of foci reported, but with foci being distributed randomly across the brain. The resulting null experiments were then used to perform new meta-analyses addressing the FSN. The latter represents the number of noise studies (i.e.\u00a0fMRI studies with non-significant results) that can be added to an ALE meta-analysis before a cluster is no longer significant. In practical terms, this approach entails assessing whether the FSN is below the lower bound (indicating non-robustness against publication bias) or above the upper bound (indicating that results are driven by a small number of hyper-influential studies). When the FSN lies between these boundaries, results can be considered sufficiently robust against the publication bias and driven by at least the desired minimum number of contributing studies. Following  , we pre-specified lower and upper boundaries for the FSN of each cluster based on the following considerations. A recent modelling approach to data included in the BrainMap database ( ) suggests a rate of publication bias of up to 30% (i.e.\u00a0up to 30 unpublished null studies per 100 published neuroimaging studies;  ). We thus pre-specified that the FSN for each cluster should exceed a lower boundary of 30% of the real data (e.g. with 52 experiments, the minimum FSN is defined as 16). As to the upper boundary, each cluster is expected to be driven by at least 10% of the included studies. Accordingly, the upper boundary of the FSN was calculated per cluster as follows: ((number of studies contributing to a cluster)\/0.1))\u2009\u2212\u2009(total number of studies included in the ALE meta-analysis). Only if the actual FSN obtained is between these two boundaries, the cluster can be assumed to be robust against both a potential file drawer effect and the effect of few hyper-influential experiments. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Action representational processing \n  \nRepresenting another\u2019s actions was associated with consistent activations in some of the key nodes of the mirror network, i.e.\u00a0bilateral occipito-temporal (fusiform and inferior occipital gyri) and posterior lateral temporal (inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri) cortex , extending into the IPL, as well as in the left superior parietal lobule\u00a0( ;  ). \n  \nThe neural bases of action representational processing.

Further activations for representing actions involved the occipito-temporal and posterior lateral temporal cortex bilaterally, extending into the superior temporal gyrus\u00a0( ;  ). Conversely, action relational processing was specifically associated with stronger frontal activity in the right anterior cingulate cortex and insula, and in the right superior and medial frontal gyri, alongside the IPL and the TPJ in the right hemisphere\u00a0( ;  ). \n  \nCommon and specific regions across action relational and action representational processing.

Along with representing others\u2019 motor and mental states, however, assessing their correspondence with our own ones might provide even more critical information for social understanding ( ). This relational facet of social cognition entails monitoring social conflicts conveyed by action perception ( ) and belief understanding ( ). While converging evidence suggests the role of TPJ in social conflict monitoring ( ), however, this proposal requires further supporting data ( ;  ). We addressed this issue by investigating the neural bases of representational and relational processing via coordinate-based meta-analyses of previous neuroimaging studies on false beliefs and action observation. \n\nTo ground our investigation in a detailed characterization of the neural bases of social understanding, we first assessed simple conditions and direct comparisons to confirm previous evidence about the neural bases of processing actions and beliefs, respectively. The former process engaged fundamental components of the action observation network ( ), including temporo-parietal regions involved in processing multisensory information ( ) and in sensorimotor transformations underpinning tool use ( ) ( ). In contrast, representing others\u2019 beliefs, regardless of one\u2019s own ones, recruited the precuneus, TPJ, anterolateral temporal cortex and the rostral sector of dmPFC\u00a0( ). These regions have been associated with the multiple subprocesses of mentalizing, and particularly constructing and taking distinct perspectives, mediated by the precuneus ( ;  ) and dmPFC ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ), respectively, via the retrieval of episodic and autobiographical memories. While the TPJ has been typically associated with transient mental inferences about people ( ;  ), the recruitment of temporo-parietal regions by tasks involving the reorientation of attention and a sense of agency ( ) led to suggest that they might support mentalizing via attentional reorienting ( ). The latter hypothesis might help explaining the neural bases of relational processing, mostly involving regions adjacent to those associated with representation processing in the same domain, including distinct sectors of the TPJ. \n\nIn the action domain, relational processing indeed involved bilateral parietal\/temporo-parietal areas and right-hemispheric premotor regions adjacent to, and partially overlapping with, the main nodes of the action observation network, alongside a posterior fronto-medial cluster encompassing the pre-SMA and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\u00a0( ). The role of these regions in relational action processing might relate to previous reports of their engagement in imitation inhibition ( ;  ). A functional distinction has been proposed for the TPJ and mPFC during imitation control, i.e.\u00a0distinguishing between self- and other-generated actions and inhibiting the other-generated action to enforce the self-generated one ( ), respectively. The former function might support the TPJ role in processing social visuo-spatial conflict while concurrently generating a sense of agency, i.e.\u00a0the feeling of being an entity performing an action localized in a specific space and perceiving the social world from this position and perspective ( ). \n\nIn the belief domain, relational processing involved the left middle temporal cortex, extending into the TPJ and inferior parietal cortex, alongside the dmPFC\u00a0( ). While complementing previous fMRI ( ) and electroencephalography ( ) evidence of TPJ involvement in false-belief understanding, these findings suggest that, also in the belief domain, this region might underpin relational processing by mediating self-other control processes. Distinguishing between self- and other-generated states indeed represents a crucial prerequisite for the subsequent mentalizing stage, i.e.\u00a0inhibiting one\u2019s own mental state to enhance others\u2019 ones ( ;  ), likely involving the mPFC ( ). In the false-belief task, this inhibitory process may support the inhibition of the true state of reality, also referred to as the \u2018default\u2019 state of belief representation ( ). In this framework, false-belief performance is spontaneously driven by the true state of reality until participants detect the social conflict between their own (true) and the other\/character\u2019s (false) beliefs. Solving this social conflict, once this is made explicit by TPJ-mediated self-other control processes ( ;  ), might additionally require the dorsal mPFC for inhibiting the spontaneous tendency to respond according to one\u2019s own beliefs ( ). \n\nImportantly, an interpretation of TPJ activity in terms of arbitration of social conflict between self- and other-related states fits with several relevant results regarding its role in other social\u2013cognitive domains. For instance, the putative TPJ involvement in coding the difference between expected and observed outcomes (i.e.\u00a0a \u2018social prediction error\u2019;  ; for a review, see  ) might also be interpreted as a social conflict processing between character\u2019s belief on, and participant\u2019s perception of, the subsequent real outcome ( ). Moreover, in moral decision processing, TPJ activity is specifically associated with tasks generating a \u2018social conflict\u2019, such as attempted harm and accident, which in turn fits with the possible role of this region in processing the mismatch between character\u2019s belief and participant\u2019s perception of the real outcome ( ). \n\nWhile confirming the pattern highlighted by single conditions and direct comparisons, conjunction analyses within each domain provided further insights into the functional characterization of shared processes across representational and relational processing. A common activity in the action domain was found in the left temporo-parietal cortex\u00a0( ), whose involvement in encoding observed actions and invariant recognition of others\u2019 actions ( ,  ) was found to depend, respectively, on the effector and the type of observed motor act regardless of the effector ( ). Instead, the common engagement of the left middle temporal cortex and TPJ by belief-related representational and relational processing\u00a0( ) might reflect their role in a superordinate requirement for mentalizing such as the storage of, and access to, socio-semantic knowledge ( ;  ). \n\nA focus on relational processing confirmed the engagement of the right TPJ and premotor cortex in action processing, and of the left TPJ and postero-temporal cortex in belief processing, respectively\u00a0( ). Moreover, both processes recruited the posterior fronto-medial cortex and the pre-SMA, in which adjacent clusters were selectively associated with action- and belief-related relational processing, respectively. \n\nThe observed lateralization of TPJ provides novel insights into the debate about the\u2014possibly different\u2014functional roles of its left- and right-hemispheric sectors. On the one hand, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left or right TPJ modulates performance on both inhibition of imitation and visual perspective-taking ( ). Other findings, however, support their putative functional distinction in social cognitive processing. The left TPJ has been associated with tasks requiring to take a de-centred perspective, such as visual perspective-taking ( ), false-belief processing ( ;  ) and strategic decision-making with other humans ( ). Instead, inhibition of imitation might represent a superordinate function of the right TPJ ( ;  ), with its response being modulated by the perception of human agency (i.e.\u00a0action monitoring;  ; also in the condition of visual deprivation;  ) and by the presence of animacy cues leading to believe that an interaction partner is human ( ). In line with this hypothesis, imitation performance is influenced by TMS-mediated modulation of the right TPJ ( ;  ). \n\nThis view of TPJ engagement in perspective-taking has been refined in distinct directions. On the one hand, this role seems limited to social inferences such as \u2018considering the perspective of another agent\u2019 rather than \u2018the perspective of an arrow\u2019 ( ). Moreover, the observed involvement of the posterior part of TPJ in processing self-other distinctions at the mental-state level ( ) fits with previous evidence that this sector underpins mentalizing and internally directed attention by deactivating the neighbouring anterior portion ( ). By showing that only the posterior part of the right TPJ is associated with belief conflict processing, while the anterior part is involved in action conflict monitoring, our results suggest that previous conflicting results concerning lateralization effects might be biased by targeting its different functional subdivisions. Altogether, these findings suggest that the TPJ role in processing self-other distinctions supports the monitoring of social conflicts conveyed by neural representations of both actions ( ) and mental states (e.g. beliefs;  ) involving the premotor and postero-temporal cortex, respectively. \n\nAdjacent, and partially overlapping, activations for action- and belief-related relational processing were found in the pre-SMA ( ) and in the posterior fronto-medial cortex (  \u00a0  ) (cyan in\u00a0 ). In addition to action monitoring ( ), the activity of pre-SMA has been associated with social evaluation (e.g.  ), probably reflecting both sensorimotor and emotional aspects of social interactions, such as contagiousness of laughter ( ) or empathic response ( ). \n\nAmong the several functions that have been ascribed to the posterior fronto-medial cortex (e.g.  ;  ;  ), executive functioning ( ;  ;  ) supports inhibition control ( ) and cognitive control ( ), in turn representing a crucial prerequisite for monitoring social conflicts ( ) both in the action ( ) and belief ( ;  ;  ) domains. In particular, the medial frontal cortex is considered to manage the social conflict between self- and other-generated actions, once these are distinguished by the TPJ, enforcing the former and the associated first-person intention ( ;  ). In the action domain, an inherent aspect of this process is represented by the top-down modulation of imitation ( ), possibly explaining the disrupted inhibition of imitation displayed by patients with frontal lesions ( ;  ), and their tendency to automatically imitate even when they are clearly instructed to not do so ( ). The present evidence that the posterior fronto-medial cortex is also involved in belief conflict monitoring might help explain its role in mentalizing by subserving the representation of intentional states for both self and other ( ). Its activation during the outcome phase of false-belief tasks, when expectations about the object location can be violated ( ), might indeed reflect its role in managing \u2018relational\u2019 social conflicts.   reported the activation of frontal executive-control regions during false-   vs   true-belief processing, reflecting the need to inhibit self-perspective. Overall, mentalizing judgements would be thus supported by multiple processes such as distinguishing and switching between one\u2019s own and another\u2019s beliefs through the TPJ and posterior fronto-medial cortex, respectively ( ). Interestingly, a similar pattern of brain activity has been also reported during implicit false-belief processing ( ;  ). Causal supporting evidence for this proposal comes from neuromodulation studies showing either up- and down-regulation of egocentric biases, associated with a consistent decrease and increase of the influence of another\u2019s mental or visuo-spatial perspective, after low-frequency repetitive TMS ( ) or anodal tDCS ( ), respectively. According to the authors, stimulating the posterior fronto-medial cortex might enhance the integration of information about another\u2019s mental ( ) or visuo-spatial ( ) perspective into one\u2019s own. While the latter hypothesis requires further supporting evidence, the data collected so far suggest that the posterior fronto-medial cortex participates in social conflict monitoring both by enhancing the required belief or action responses, and by inhibiting the automatic tendency to report the true belief or to imitate ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nMethodological guidelines for coordinate neuroimaging meta-analyses led to select only studies performing the whole-brain analysis ( ). It is important to stress, however, that similar results on the role of the TPJ and posterior fronto-medial cortex in processing social conflict have been also reported by studies in which strong a priori hypotheses justified ROI analyses or SVC procedures [e.g.  ;  ;  ; see   for a meta-analysis based on ROIs]. \n\nConsidering   hypothesis, our rigorous approach provided results supporting the role of the left TPJ in belief conflict processing, through the distinction between self- and other-related states, rather than to belief representation   per se  . However, unlike   predictions and   findings, we did not provide conclusive evidence for the involvement of the right TPJ in false-belief processing. Moreover, we also reported unexpected evidence , such as the right TPJ activity in association with action (  vs   belief) conflict processing, and the role of the posterior fronto-medial cortex in both action and belief conflict processing, through the inhibition of conflictual representations. \n\nImportantly, unveiling the properties and neural bases of relational processing might help extend current perspectives of impaired social cognition and communication (e.g.  ). Based on the considerable individual variability in perceiving or interpreting even a same event ( ;  ), social communication and interactions may depend on tracking how well present information about others aligns with one\u2019s own perspective even more than inferring their states. Impairments in detecting, processing or solving experiential differences are thus expected to reflect in altered social communication and\/or interactions. In line with this hypothesis, several populations\u2014including young children ( ) and non-human primates ( )\u2014display altered performance in false-belief tasks despite the normal understanding of true-belief situations. This evidence confirms that generating another\u2019s specific representation of the world in false-belief paradigms is qualitatively different from, and more difficult than, attributing one\u2019s own one like in true-belief situations ( ;  ). Indeed, growing evidence suggests that the multifaceted pattern of social deficits observed in autism may reflect subtle issues with monitoring social conflict, rather than altered representational abilities or \u2018mindblindness\u2019 altogether ( ;  ). This hypothesis has been recently assessed with an implicit false-belief task ( ) merely requiring to respond when a visual target is detected while holding constant belief manipulations as in the Sally\u2013Anne task. It might be speculated that RTs reflect participants\u2019 belief about the stimulus location ( ;  ). Instead, another person\u2019s belief that the target would be present can speed up target detection, even though participants themselves had been convinced that the target would not be present ( ;  ). In this context, an account of autism centred on impaired mentalizing, and thus on the lack of belief representations ( ), would not be expected to predict this contribution to detection performance. Instead, strong autistic traits were associated with slowed responses when participants\u2014after being convinced of the stimulus absence\u2014were informed about another\u2019s, opposite, belief. This finding suggests a preserved representation of the other person\u2019s belief, associated with altered monitoring\/resolution of social conflicts between that representation and one\u2019s own one, particularly when the latter must be expressed ( ). This conclusion is strengthened by an explicit experimental paradigm showing that the impact of others\u2019 false beliefs is enhanced, in autistic individuals more than controls, when the task requires to verbalize their own mental state ( ). While further evidence is required to evaluate the contribution of altered relational processing, these data at least suggest that autistic individuals\u2019 social impairment is not fully explained by a \u2018representational\u2019 framework, i.e.\u00a0by difficulties in representing others\u2019 intentions\u2014be it in terms of mental states or actions\u2014  per se  . These data therefore suggest that autistic individuals\u2019 social impairment might be better explained by altered relational, than representational, processing and that the autistic brain might fail to monitor the social conflict between one\u2019s own and others\u2019\u2014properly represented\u2014actions or mental states. This hypothesis fits with the evidence that, at the neural level, the difficulties of autistic patients with social conflict processing are associated with decreased TPJ activity ( ). \n\nThis hypothesis has already been translated into potential treatment strategies, with participants being trained to either imitate or inhibit imitation, and thus to either represent another\u2019s actions or monitor action conflict ( ). Within a \u2018relational\u2019 framework, training action conflict monitoring (rather than action representation) was expected to improve mentalizing task comparing incongruent with congruent social conditions. Training to monitor action conflict, compared with training to represent others\u2019 actions, was indeed associated with improved performance on this mentalizing task. By showing a transfer from the trained monitoring of action conflict to the monitoring of conflictual mental (rather than action) representations, these results suggest the existence of (at least partially) common underlying processes of social conflict monitoring transcending single domains. These data support the notion that imitation\u2013inhibition training enhances self-other distinction processing, which in turn facilitates improved performance on both the imitation\u2013inhibition and mentalizing tasks. Our results support this view by showing a common engagement of the posterior fronto-medial cortex for both action- and belief-related relational processing, alongside domain-specific sectors in adjacent posterior fronto-medial regions and in the left- and right-hemispheric TPJ sectors. Overall, this pattern of findings highlights the potential effect of training social conflict monitoring in rehabilitation protocols for autistic patients, possibly in conjunction with neuromodulation techniques targeting the TPJ and\/or posterior fronto-medial regions shown by the present meta-analytic results. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nA limitation of our work is the selection of \u201csuboptimal\u201d contrasts to study belief representational processing, i.e. (i) true belief\u2009>\u2009control non-mental condition and (ii) false belief\u2009>\u2009false photograph. Neither contrasts, indeed, are free from limitations. The former contrast allows to control for the structure of the stimuli, but in the target \u201ctrue-belief\u201d condition participants might rely only on their own mental states, possibly attributed to the story character, without necessarily generating a representation of the character\u2019s mental states ( ). The second contrast, using the \u201cfalse-belief\u201d condition as a target condition, addresses not only mental-state representation but also social conflict. There is no evidence that the \u201cfalse-photograph\u201d condition (with perceptual conflict) can control for social conflict. At this stage, how to address the representation of mental states, while isolating this process from the representation of one\u2019s own mental states and from social conflict between one\u2019s own and others\u2019 mental states, remains controversial. \n\nA partial solution is provided by   study. In this experiment, as in a classical Sally\u2013Anne false-belief task, participants are asked to predict which boxes a character would open based on the scenario presented. Each scenario entails three randomly ordered statements, concerning character\u2019s belief, character\u2019s desire and reality (about the location of the desired object). Such randomized order ensured participants\u2019 encoding of the character\u2019s true belief on at least 50% of trials in which they did not already know the object\u2019s true location. This design therefore allowed to address the weakness of several studies in which participants could provide the correct answer, even when ignoring a character\u2019s beliefs on true-belief trials, by merely relying on their own knowledge of reality. Isolating \u2018mental-state representation\u2019 would require comparing this type of the \u2018true-belief\u2019 condition with a non-mental control condition. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur work provides novel neural evidence showing specific brain activity for belief and action conflict processing. This evidence supports the unique status of relational processing, i.e.\u00a0the ability to evaluate whether, how and how much others\u2019 states (mis)match with our own ones, which might represent an even more important prerequisite for effective social communication and interactions than representing those states via the action observation or mentalizing network. The present findings suggest that this process involves adjacent sectors of the posterior fronto-medial cortex, differing in their selectivity to the action or belief domains, whereby social conflict processing is supported by the inhibition of conflictual representations ( ), as well as the left and right TPJ, likely contributing to self-other differentiation for mental and action states, respectively. These findings pave the way for further studies on the main building blocks of normal and pathological social cognition, and for the design of rehabilitative treatment protocols based on their neurocognitive characterization. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9976764,"text_md5":"b855619259e472d36ddcbc8f2043de9c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,76],"journal":[77,101],"publication_year":[103,107],"title":[118,231],"keywords":[245,330],"abstract":[343,1859],"body":[1868,60140]},"batch":1,"pmid":36695428,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsad003","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9976764","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9976764"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9976764\">9976764<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9976764  Relational vs representational social cognitive processing: a coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data"}

Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a primary headache disorder that causes throbbing pain usually on one side of the head. It is the most common neurological disease with predominance in females and the sixth-highest cause of disability worldwide.  The predominant symptom of migraine is severe headache attacks, which worsen during physical activity or stress, and may be accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nMigraine can be classified according to The International Headache Society (IHS) into migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA) with specific symptoms associated with each one. In MwoA, which represents the most common type of migraine, patients suffer from moderate to severe headache attacks with an average duration between 4 to 72 hours that are felt as a unilateral pulsation, and usually increase in severity with physical activities and do not respond to treatment. These symptoms are usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia or phonophobia.  On the other hand, MwA is a less common type occurring in only 30% of migraineurs and is characterized by several reversible focal neurological symptoms that come before, with, or in the absence of headache. The visual aura phenomenon comes in the form of spots and zig-zag lines at the center of the visual field and is followed by motor, sensory, speech, and language symptoms. \n\nAccording to the frequency of headaches, migraine can be classified into episodic and chronic migraine. Episodic migraine (EM) has an average headache duration between 4 to 72 hours, and attack frequencies of <15 days per month. Whereas chronic migraine (CM) has a higher frequency of headaches for more than 3 months with an average of 15 days per month. \n\nMigraine can also be classified into four cycling phases: preictal, ictal, postictal, and interictal.  The preictal phase lasts up to 48 hours before the onset of a headache attack. Some evidence suggests an activation of the hypothalamus immediately before the headache attack which then leads to hypersensitivity and hypervigilance to incoming stimuli.  Whereas the ictal phase occurs during the headache attack and most symptoms can be seen in this phase, such as nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity to visual, olfactory, auditory, and somatosensory stimuli, and it can last for 4 to 72 hours.  In addition, the postictal phase begins after the headache attack and lasts up to 24 hours, then disappears, and is characterized by symptoms other than headaches such as cognitive deficits, fatigue, and others.  Finally, the interictal phase happens between migraine attacks, and patients in this phase are headache-free and asymptomatic.  Although most of the symptoms appear during migraine attacks, some ictal symptoms may also occur less predominantly in this phase. \n\nAlthough the mechanism and pathophysiology of migraine are not very well understood, several studies revealed structural and functional abnormalities in several brain regions, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography studies suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and defects in energy metabolism and other metabolic alterations in migraineurs.  Another proposed mechanism associated with pain processing and perception in migraine patients is a vasodilatory effect of intracranial and extracranial blood vessels near the trigeminal pathway, which will activate the release of vasoactive neuropeptides such as the substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and others. \n\nNeuroimaging modalities have recently been used to study the pathophysiology of migraine in different behavioral domains. Functional MRI (fMRI) has allowed researchers to study pain processing and perception in migraineurs during pain stimulation tasks, using noxious, visual, or auditory stimuli, and to investigate the relationship of atypical patterns of brain activation associated with migraine.  Another modality that has been used is voxel-based morphometry (VBM), which investigates volumetric changes in gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume, and cerebrospinal fluid across the whole brain.  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to investigate the clustered and converged brain regions of activation and deactivation associated with pain processing in response to noxious stimuli in migraineurs compared to healthy controls (HC) and to assess the relationship between functional abnormalities and structural alterations in GMV across VBM studies. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Literature search and inclusion criteria \n  \nThis study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The detailed study protocol is registered on PROSPERO and can be accessed through (CRD42022332314; URL:  ). \n\nA systematic search through PubMed database was carried out for peer-reviewed English studies on the following keywords: \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d, \u201ctask-based fMRI\u201d, \u201cnociceptive stimuli\u201d, \u201cpain perception\u201d, \u201cmigraine\u201d, \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d, and \u201cgray matter volume\u201d. The detailed search algorithm is shown in Supplemental Digital Content 1,  . We also searched Sleuth (3.0.4) database from Brainmap ( ) for fMRI and VBM studies. \n\nA two-step screening process was done for the retrieved studies. First, two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for the following criteria: migraine patients and HC, task-based fMRI, and pain stimulation task. Studies were excluded if they: did not enroll HC, were on animal subjects, used resting-state fMRI, were on other types of headaches, or were case reports, reviews, or letters. Second, another two reviewers screened full texts of included studies for the following criteria: whole-brain coordinates are reported for task-based fMRI, coordinates reported for gray matter volume, and included between-group comparison HC and migraineurs. Studies were excluded if they: did not report coordinates, used region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, had no pain stimulation fMRI, or did not compare with HC. A third reviewer made the judgment in case of disagreement in both steps. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data extraction \n  \nData were extracted from each study for the first author\u2019s name, year of the study, demographic variables for the number of migraineurs and migraine type, number of HC, mean age (Standard Deviation [SD]), clinical information for disease duration, and attack frequency. Imaging variables were extracted for the software used for analysis, image acquisition, pain stimuli for fMRI task, and threshold settings. \n\n\n### 2.3. Quality assessment \n  \nThe quality of included studies was assessed by two reviewers based on The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for fMRI studies,  and the 12-checklist tool for VBM studies which has been previously described by Strakowski et al  The NOS tool evaluates the quality based on three domains: cohort selection, comparability between cases and controls, and exposure, with a total of 8 subcategories. The scale\u2019s overall score ranges from 0 to 8. The risk of bias was rated as high (1\u20133), moderate (4\u20135), and low (6\u20138). The 12-checklist tool evaluated 3 domains: sample characteristics, methods for image acquisition and analysis, in addition to limitations and conclusions, with a total of 12 subcategories in which a score of 1, 0.5, or 0 was set, if the criteria were fully, partially, or not met. Detailed information for the 12-checklist tool is shown in Supplemental Digital Content 2,  . \n\n\n### 2.4. Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nThe activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a quantitative meta-analytical approach for structural and functional neuroimaging studies, it calculates where foci from multiple experiments converge, by treating the reported coordinates as a spatial probability center, rather than single points. The ALE approach uses a random-effect model to calculate the converged areas between studies, rather than a fixed-effect model which compares between foci.  Foci data for fMRI and VBM studies were extracted by two reviewers for the first author\u2019s name, year of study, the number of subjects, and coordinates of each experiment in a 3D stereotactic format (x, y, z). Then, foci were transformed into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the icbm2tal tool developed by Lancaster et al  and provided by GingerALE, which is a better fit than Brett transform mni2tal tool. The meta-analysis was conducted by applying threshold settings of uncorrected   P   value < .001 and a minimum volume of 250\u2009mm . \n\nTo explore regional differences of reduced GMV across migraine subtypes, we performed two subgroup analyses, the first contrast between MwA and MwoA relative to HC. The second contrast was between CM and EM compared to HC. We used an uncorrected   P   value threshold < .001 and a minimum volume of 250\u2009mm . \n\nThe thresholded ALE images were visualized using Mango version 4.1 software for Windows OS (Research Imaging Institute \u2013 Mango [uthscsa.edu]), and placed on the 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091 \u00d7 1\u2009mm T1-weighted ICBM 2009c nonlinear symmetric template, which represents an unbiased non-linear average of the MNI152 database with high-spatial-resolution and signal-to-noise.  Anatomical labels were shown using the MNI atlas provided in Mango. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study selection and sample characteristics \n  \nOut of 1136 studies identified from PubMed search, 58 studies were retrieved for assessment after duplicate removal and title and abstract screening. A total of 16 task-based fMRI and 22 VBM studies were included in the ALE meta-analysis after the full-text screening. The detailed screening process is shown in the PRISMA flow diagram in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram illustrating the screening process of included studies. fMRI = functional MRI, HC = healthy controls, PRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, VBM = voxel-based morphometry. \n  \nThe full sample comprised 1259 migraine patients and 995 healthy headache-free controls.

Quality assessment \n  \nEleven fMRI studies showed a low risk of bias according to the NOS tool and 5 showed a moderate risk of bias due to unreported controls recruitment and pain exposure were tested for migraineurs only. All studies compared migraineurs and HC for activation and deactivation. For the VBM studies, all studies reported a low risk of bias with scores > 8. Only 5 studies evaluated patients for a follow-up, 12 studies used sliced thickness for MRI > 3\u2009mm or did not report full image acquisition. Detailed scores of each study are shown in the Supplemental Digital Content 3 and 4,  . \n\n\n### 3.3. ALE meta-analysis \n  \n#### 3.3.1. ALE analysis of fMRI studies. \n  \nSixty-four foci from 30 fMRI pain stimulation experiments on 415 migraine patients and 325 HC showed increased activation in migraine patients in the right substantia nigra compared to HC (MNI coordinates [  x  ,   y  ,   z  ]: 12, \u221212, \u221212). While showing decreased activation in the bilateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum through the culmen (MNI coordinates [  x  ,   y  ,   z  ]: \u22128\/10, \u221228, \u221220\/\u221216]). Using a   P   value threshold < .003, migraineurs also showed increased activation in the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area [BA] 6) relative to controls (MNI coordinates [  x  ,   y  ,   z  ]: \u221248, 10, 44). Peak MNI coordinates, cluster sizes, and   P   values are shown in Table  .

ALE analysis of VBM studies. \n  \nA total of 50 experiments consisting of 845 migraine patients and 656 HC and 218 foci in which migraineurs showed an increase or decrease in GMV were entered in the ALE meta-analysis. ALE clusters of increased GMV in migraineurs compared to HC were observed in the left parahippocampus extending to the amygdala, left superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), left cuneus of the occipital lobe (BA 18), and right posterior lobe of the cerebellum to the cerebellar tonsils, and right putamen nucleus (MNI coordinates: [\u221226, \u22122, \u221214], [\u221246, \u221254, 18], [\u221218, \u221282, 28], [46, \u221246, \u221244], [32, \u22122, \u221212], respectively). Whereas clusters of reduced GMV in migraineurs compared to controls were seen in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44), left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6), and right medial frontal gyrus (BA 25), (MNI coordinates: [\u221260\/62, 12\/14, 10\/12], [\u221224, 16, 52], [4, 24, \u221224], respectively). Peak MNI coordinates, cluster sizes, and   P   values are shown in Table  . ALE maps of increased and decreased GMV are shown in Figure  . To exclude the confounding effect of age-related GMV reduction, a sensitivity analysis was performed for GMV reduction by excluding Celle et al study on elderly patients (mean age 75).  The results of the sensitivity analysis did not reveal different clustered areas than the pooled analysis, however, cluster size differed slightly as the following: bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (401\u2009mm , 170\u2009mm ), left superior frontal gyrus (289\u2009mm ), and right medial frontal gyrus (165\u2009mm ). \n  \nALE maps of GMV increase (green) and decrease (red) in migraineurs versus HC.

Subgroup analysis of GMV in MwoA and MwA. \n  \nA total of 59 foci from 12 experiments were included in the subgroup analysis of 756 subjects of MwoA and MwA relative to HC. When compared to HC, MwoA patients showed a decrease in GMV in the right insula, anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus. While MwA patients showed GMV reduction in the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum, cingulate gyrus, insula, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and inferior frontal and temporal gyri. Peak MNI coordinates, cluster sizes, and   P   values are presented in Table  .

Subgroup analysis of GMV in EM and CM. \n  \nSeven experiments that consisted of 36 foci contributed to the subgroup analysis of 180 episodic migraineurs compared to HC, and 212 CM patients compared to HC. Chronic migraineurs showed decreased GMV in the left precentral gyrus (BA 13), whereas EM patients showed decreased GMV in the left uncus, precentral gyrus, parahippocampus, and right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). Peak MNI coordinates, cluster sizes, and   P   values are presented in Table  . ALE maps of increased and decreased GMV are shown in Figure  . \n  \nALE maps of subgroup analysis of GMV reduction between CM (red) and EM (green).

Functional abnormalities. \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis on fMRI studies revealed clusters of activation and deactivation in the subcortical regions including the substantia nigra, subthalamic and red nuclei of the midbrain. These regions show an important involvement in pain integration and processing.  Several studies reported atypical activation of the basal ganglia in pain induction and demonstrated the role of subthalamic and caudate nuclei in the integration of multisensory signals, which may be associated with the pathophysiology of migraine. In addition to its function in pain sensation, the subthalamic nucleus also participates in thermal sensation, playing a role in the decreased sensitivity to thermal and mechanical pain during heat or pain stimulation. Although several MRI studies reported different patterns of activation in frontal,  and cerebellar regions,  our results, did not reveal any clusters of increased or decreased activation in the prefrontal cortex or cerebellar regions. However, when we applied a more lenient threshold, clusters of increased activation were observed in the middle frontal gyrus in addition to the substantia nigra. On the other hand, clusters of decreased activation were observed in the bilateral anterior lobes of the cerebellum. These functional abnormalities correspond to the structural changes in GMV in migraineurs as observed in our study. \n\nSurprisingly, an fMRI study by Stankewitz et al,  revealed stronger activation in HC than interictal migraineurs at the level of the trigeminal nuclei but did not show any difference in the thalamic nuclei or the somatosensory regions. However, this might be attributed to the biological differences between migraineurs and HC in the transmission of nociceptive stimulation signals, or that these findings are specific to and driven by trigeminal stimulation. \n\n\n#### 4.1.2. GMV alterations. \n  \nSeveral studies have reported consistent results of structural abnormalities in migraineurs using VBM analysis as an increase or decrease in GMV. In our study, we found clusters of increased GMV in limbic regions including the parahippocampus extending to the amygdala, subcortical regions such as the putamen of the lentiform nucleus, temporal cortex such as the superior temporal gyrus, the visual cortex including the cuneus of the occipital lobe, and cerebellar regions such as the cerebellar tonsils in the posterior lobe. On the other hand, we also found clusters of decreased GMV in migraineurs when compared to HC. These clusters were primarily located in the prefrontal cortex including the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, superior, and middle frontal gyri. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex is known to modulate executive functions and attention networks. However, several studies have reported an association of the prefrontal cortex activation in pain stimulation tasks. Its role can be thought of as directing the cognitive aspects to process and respond to pain stimuli.  Several studies have also shown activation of the cerebellum in association with trigeminal nociception. The role of the cerebellum is underlined by pain perception rather than specifically on pain processing. Apart from its role in nociception, the cerebellum has also shown activation in migraine episodes.  The limbic network has also demonstrated a role in pain processing in migraineurs through the amygdala. While emotional processing is the major role served by the amygdala, in addition to the sensory perception of fear and anxiety, it also contributes to pain cognition such as memories and pain prediction, through its connection with cortical structures. It also receives nociceptive signals from the trigeminal system as well as subcortical regions and the spinal cord. When compared to MwoA, MwA patients showed GMV reduction in frontal and visual cortex regions, such as the cerebellum. This finding could be associated with the visual aura phenomena observed in these patients. A study by Rocca et al,  did not reveal any difference between MwA and MwoA, however, this may be due to the small sample size in each group. A case report and a cohort study found an association between the brainstem in the pathogenesis of migraine with aura.  In contrast to our results, a study by Neeb et al,  showed GMV increase in CM patients compared to HC, while showing GMV reduction in the prefrontal cortex for EM patients as observed in our study. As GMV reduction can be attributed to older age, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the study on elderly patients, however, we did not find any different clusters than the pooled analysis. This may be attributed to only one study had older patients. \n\n\n\n### 4.2. Applicability of the evidence \n  \nFunctional MRI studies on migraine patients have shown abnormal brain activation compared to HC, these patterns of hyperactivation or hypoactivation might be associated with an abnormal pattern of GMV increase or decrease as observed by VBM studies. In a study by Hubbard et al,  the resting-state functional connectivity in migraine patients showed disrupted connectivity in the default mode network and sensory network, including the posterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal and temporal gyri, and the prefrontal cortex. These patterns were associated with increased attention and sensitivity to visual stimuli, or hypervigilance to ongoing pain. \n\nTo validate and increase the evidence of the applicability of fMRI or VBM studies on migraine, we collected all the results and quantitively synthesize them to present a putative biomarker in the diagnosis and management of migraine and migraine subtypes. The applicability of our findings relies on the methodology used to synthesize them and the number of evidence that contributed to the analysis. \n\n\n### 4.3. Quality of the evidence \n  \nAll Recruited studies allowed studying the functional and structural abnormalities associated with pain processing in migraine patients. As only 5 studies studied migraine patients with a follow-up after different time points, the long-term effect or the effect of medication from baseline could not be studied. All VBM studies used strong thresholds with correction for multiple comparisons such as false-discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise error (FWE), which provide more reliable results except for two studies.  Eight out of 16 fMRI studies did not use corrected   P   values.  And to avoid the bias of ROI-based analysis in fMRI studies, we constricted our inclusion to whole-brain analysis only. \n\n\n### 4.4. Potential biases in the review process \n  \nThe meta-analyses conducted in this study have several strengths. First, studies that used ROI-based analysis were excluded as this approach can present biased results and does not represent changes across the whole brain. Thus, to avoid the risk of biased results in our study, we limited our inclusion criteria to whole-brain neuroimaging studies only. Second, subgroup analyses were performed on the GMV changes in migraine groups according to the presence or absence of visual aura, and the duration of migraine into chronic or episodic. Third, the fMRI studies included in our meta-analysis are all consistent in terms of the studied behavioral domain, which was pain processing and management, this in turn adds homogeneity to the included studies. Fourth, we investigated the association of functional and structural abnormalities observed in migraine patients and concluded that GMV changes were concordant with the affected functional domains. Lastly, our study presents with high power due to a large number of studies included. \n\nHowever, our findings should be interpreted with caution in the context of several limitations, some of which were out of our control. First, we could not apply the most stringent threshold settings of FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons as this approach needs a large number of foci and some clusters may be eliminated, so we applied a conservative threshold of uncorrected   P   value < .001. Second, our analysis was not constricted to a specific paradigm class, due to the heterogeneity across studies in experimental designs, and the results can be affected by the stimuli type or the induced regions. Regarding the VBM analysis, as it is based on linear statistics, and the distribution in reality is based on a Gaussian distribution, a non-linear hyperplane is a better representation for between group comparisons, thus, the VBM analysis can result in systemic differences between groups.  Third, some fMRI studies did not use correction methods for   P   values, which may affect the reliability of their results. Finally, we could not perform a subgroup analysis between different magnetic field strengths, as most studies used high strength, however, low field strength could affect the neuroimaging results, as the 3.0 T magnetic strength demonstrates a high-signal-noise ratio and can detect subtle changes in GMV and therefore more reliable than the 1.0 T strength. \n\n\n### 4.5. Future recommendations \n  \nThere are several important recommendations for the advanced understanding of pain processing in migraineurs that should be addressed. First, future studies should report coordinate data of fMRI and VBM experiments using corrected thresholds, as our meta-analysis has included some uncorrected   P   value. Second, further longitudinal studies are also needed to evaluate the structural and functional differences between MwA in comparison with MwoA, and the potential changes occurring between its phases: preictal, ictal, postictal, and interictal phases. In addition, future exploration of the effects of medications on pain processing in migraineurs, and the comparison between medicated migraineurs and non-medicated is necessary. Finally, additional investigations of the potential effects of comorbidities on pain processing in migraineurs are needed. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the converged regions of abnormal activation and GMV patterns associated with migraine. Our results represent a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and management of migraine. Our findings suggest that the observed patterns of different brain activation and deactivation in frontal and cerebellar regions between migraineurs and HC might be associated with decreased pain sensitivity and increased attention to painful stimuli in migraineurs. These functional changes are parallel to the structural changes in the GMV of frontal and limbic regions in migraineurs, which represent an association between the structural and functional integrities of migraineurs\u2019 brain. Our sub-group analysis revealed different clusters of GMV changes between MwA and MwoA, as MwA showed cerebellar changes which may indicate an association with the visual aura phenomenon in these patients. Thus, our study represents a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and management of migraine and the differentiation between migraine subtypes. Further studies are required to establish how these functional and structural changes can be used to observe disease progression or utilized in therapeutic interventions. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Majdi Al Qawasmeh, Yaman B.

{"text":"Zapparoli, Laura and Mariano, Marika and Paulesu, Eraldo\nCommun Biol, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nHow the motor system copes with aging: a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of aging on motor function control\n\n# Keywords\n\nBrain\nNeural ageing\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nMotor cognitive functions and their neurophysiology evolve and degrade along the lifespan in a dramatic fashion. Current models of how the brain adapts to aging remain inspired primarily by studies on memory or language processes. Yet, aging is strongly associated with reduced motor independence and the associated degraded interaction with the environment: accordingly, any neurocognitive model of aging not considering the motor system is, ipso facto, incomplete. Here we present a meta-analysis of forty functional brain-imaging studies to address aging effects on motor control. Our results indicate that motor control is associated with aging-related changes in brain activity, involving not only motoric brain regions but also posterior areas such as the occipito-temporal cortex. Notably, some of these differences depend on the specific nature of the motor task and the level of performance achieved by the participants. These findings support neurocognitive models of aging that make fewer anatomical assumptions while also considering tasks-dependent and performance-dependent manifestations. Besides the theoretical implications, the present data also provide additional information for the motor rehabilitation domain, indicating that motor control is a more complex phenomenon than previously understood, to which separate cognitive operations can contribute and decrease in different ways with aging. \n  \nMany aspects of neuronal control degrade with ageing, including motor control. Using a meta-analysis of functional MRI images, it is made apparent that the ageing brain relies more on visual strategies than sensory stimuli to maintain motor function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPeople worldwide live longer: for the first time in history, most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. Based on the World Health Organization projections, the world\u2019s population aged 60 years and beyond is expected to total 2 billion by 2050, more than twice as many in 2015 . Cognitive functioning is of great importance in older age. Preserving cognitive functioning delays care dependency and reverse physical frailty; it follows that understanding age-related cognitive decline and its neural mechanisms is a major topic of research in the domain of cognitive neuroscience. The advent and availability of magnetic resonance functional imaging methods have significantly advanced the understanding of how aging affects the neurobiological functions at multiple levels leading to changes in brain function . \n\nIt is widely known that even healthy aging is associated with grey matter volume reductions and functional brain changes, together with cognitive decline in a variety of domains:  memory , sensory perception , attention and executive functions , and language . \n\nHowever, only a limited number of studies have focused on the effects of physiological aging on motor control, which we define here as a gradual decrease of motor abilities associated with aging in the absence of a significant breakdown of specific neural systems nor accompanying symptoms like, for example, tremor, rigidity, or typical gait disorders. This is quite surprising since the quality of life of older adults is strongly associated with their motor independence and the subsequent efficient interactions with the environment. \n\nIn the present paper, we address this specific topic by reviewing with a quantitative meta-analysis the available evidence derived from task-based brain imaging activation studies on how the physiological process of aging affects motor control. Crucially, we considered not only explicit motor execution tasks, but also cognitive-motor tasks (e.g., motor imagery, motor prediction paradigms, typically used to investigate motor functions, see for example refs.  ) and the achieved level of behavioural performance: this last aspect was taken as an indirect index of the task demands. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytical attempt to summarize the previous findings on aging in the domain of motor control with this specific approach. \n\nBefore presenting our study, we first introduce the current neurocognitive theories on how healthy aging affects brain functioning. We then summarize the evidence derived from previous reviews and meta-analyses conducted on this topic. Finally, we spell out the methodological features of the present study that make it novel in comparison with previous meta-analyses of aging and the motor system. \n\nThere is a rich body of literature documenting age-related patterns of brain activity associated with the changes in cognitive functions that are typical of physiological aging , interpreted by several cognitive models. \n\nOn the one hand, the compensation hypothesis predicts that age-related increases in brain activation, as well as the recruitment of additional areas, compensate for various neural\/behavioural deficits . According to the compensation hypothesis, these overactivations would be larger in good than in poor performers. Compensatory patterns have been documented for several cognitive domains (e.g., working memory, episodic memory retrieval, perception, inhibitory control ). This phenomenon was initially observed in the prefrontal cortex.\u00a0In particular, compensatory processes have been described as reduced inter-hemispheric asymmetries for tasks associated with strongly lateralized fMRI patterns in younger participants . This overall pattern is well captured by the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD model, ). \n\nA similar compensatory hypothesis is covered by the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging model (PASA, ), whereby aging is associated with a significant increment of the frontal lobes\u2019 activation and reduced neural activity in posterior brain areas (mainly occipito-temporal cortices). Age-related reductions in occipital activity have been attributed to deficits in sensory processing, while age-related increased prefrontal activity would represent an attempt to compensate for these deficits. \n\nOn the other hand, the dedifferentiation hypothesis posits that age-related brain functional changes might indicate a generalized diffusion of brain activity attributable to deficits in neurotransmission, which in turn causes a loss of neural specialization. This hypothesis suggests that age-related\u00a0hyperactivations should not be accompanied by successful behavioural performance . Several experiments have previously supported the dedifferentiation hypothesis. For example, Loibl et al.  observed age-related increased activations in ipsilateral motor areas (M1 and SMA), that were negatively correlated with motor performance . Similar results were found by Bernard et al.  with transcranial magnetic stimulation, reporting for the elderly subjects more diffuse motor cortical excitability in the hemisphere contralateral and ipsilateral to the recorded motor evoked potentials. Notably, this broader excitability correlated with augmented reaction times . \n\nHowever, these hypotheses seem insufficient to capture the dynamics of compensation in elderly subjects when considering the specific task demands. These may change in an age-dependent manner as summarized by the\u00a0Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuit Hypothesis (CRUNCH hypothesis, ) and the posited group by performance interactions. Indeed, this model calls into play the level of task demands, proposing that in tasks characterized by lower task demands, older adults recruit greater neural resources to compensate and reach the same level of behavioural performance as young people. When the task demands increase, they show equivalent or lower activation and worse behavioural performance compared with young adults . Authors describe this phenomenon as a tradeoff phenomenon that may explain why, as the task demand increases, the younger individuals can reach a good level of performance compared with elderly people who show a declined performance . \n\nMore recently, the same authors proposed the so-called Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition model , defining how and why the compensation through overactivation arises in the aging brain. In the same model, they introduce the concept of scaffolding to describe neural adaptations associated with the life cycle. The basic idea is that the brain is a dynamic organism seeking to maintain homeostatic cognitive functioning. Aging would be associated with a continuous functional reorganization and functional repairs that result in self-generated support to cognitive functioning through the scaffolding. The innovative insight is that scaffolding is not considered a hallmark of the aging brain alone. Instead, it would be a process that characterizes the entire lifespan. In fact, in young individuals, the main aim of the scaffolding process is to respond to challenging situations, e.g., when asked to perform a difficult task or when asked to achieve new skills. However, in elderly people scaffolding processes may be requested even to perform simple tasks due to the degradation of existing neural circuitry that makes basic tasks challenging. This model is particularly important, since it represents the first attempt of linking functional, structural, cognitive changes in aging. \n\nTo date, only a few meta-analyses investigated the functional effects of aging on cognitive and neural functioning. Spreng et al.  meta-analytically reviewed 77 functional imaging studies tackling different cognitive functions (\u201cmemory\u201d ; \u201cperception\u201d;  \u201cexecutive functions\u201d ; \u201cmotor functions\u201d ): they found that old adults activate prefrontal regions more than young adults. Interestingly, when the behavioural performance was similar between the two groups, older adults engaged more the left prefrontal cortex, while the right prefrontal cortex was more activated when a behavioural decline was present. On the other hand, young adults recruited occipital regions more than older adults, particularly when performance was unequal and during perceptual tasks . More recently, Li et al.  described similar results in a meta-analysis conducted on 115 functional imaging studies. The authors found a general decline in the behavioural performance recorded during the fMRI scanning in older adults. This decline was associated with hypoactivations of the visual network and hyperactivations of fronto-parietal and default mode networks. As in Spreng et al. , there was a significant relationship between behavioural and neurofunctional findings, since the degree of increased activation in the fronto-parietal network was positively associated with the behavioural performance of older adults . The results of both meta-analyses partially support the HAROLD model, since they showed increased activations of the prefrontal cortex in older adults (even if not bilaterally). Moreover, older adults presented significant hypoactivations of the visual network, a finding in line with PASA model\u2014even though such pattern did not replicate for all the cognitive domains explored . Accordingly, it looks as if the HAROLD and the PASA models of aging, with their detailed anatomical predictions, do not capture fully the age-related brain changes described in later studies. Moreover, as for most of the studies on which the HAROLD, PASA, and CRUNCH models were formulated, the experiments included in these previous meta-analyses largely addressed the domains of episodic memory, working memory or reasoning, leaving motor cognition largely neglected. \n\nAging-related prefrontal hyperactivations are also reported by studies addressing the effects of aging on motor control. Indeed, Seidler et al.  reviewed this literature to report that older adults show additional activations in the higher-level prefrontal region, but also in sensorimotor cortical areas. Notably, the activity of these prefrontal and sensorimotor regions was often associated with better performance, suggesting the possibility that the engagement of additional areas may represent a compensatory process taking place during motor task performance . \n\nThis was partially in line with the results of the only available meta-analysis exploring the effects of aging on the neurofunctional correlates of motor control. Turesky and colleagues  conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on older adults and young adults all performing paced right-hand finger movement tasks. The authors found that elderly subjects activated more frequently the right sensorimotor cortex, the right supramarginal gyrus, the medial premotor cortex, and the right posterior cerebellum. They concluded that older adults showed augmented ipsilateral recruitment of brain regions during right-hand finger movements . \n\nHowever, this paper did not explore the possible interactions of the factor aging with the level of performance achieved by the subjects and with\u00a0the nature of the motor task, something that we aimed at with the present study, where we also considered cognitive-motor tasks (e.g., motor imagery, action prediction, action observation). Moreover, the mentioned meta-analysis only focused on one specific (explicit) motor task performed with the same limb, leaving unexplored the possibility that such findings might generalize independently from the specific motor task and the effector involved. \n\nThe imaging literature, with about 40 specific empirical papers focused on various motor tasks executed by elderly and young participants, is now sufficiently mature to try and fill this gap, and test how good are the neurocognitive models in capturing the available evidence. The obvious tools to try and test the goodness of such data fitting are quantitative meta-analyses, particularly those performed with techniques that permit to test articulated factorial designs, as the designs implied by the intersections of the factors alluded to earlier on, like age, nature of the task and level of performance\/task demands. This is what we describe next with the specific aims of our study. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of aging on the neurofunctional correlates of motor control, testing the different neurocognitive theories of aging with a meta-analytical approach. Besides the aging process, we considered two other factors: the specific nature of the tasks (with reference to the presence\/absence of an overt motor output: motor execution tasks vs cognitive-motor tasks) and the task demands (inferred by the level of performance achieved by the elderly subjects: similar to young participants vs inferior). We focused on evidence coming from fMRI\/PET activation studies on groups of young and elderly individuals. As the reader will see below, we identified neuroimaging studies either on explicit motor execution tasks (i.e., simple motor paradigms such as finger-tapping\/opposition tasks, bimanual or face\/mouth movements; more complex paradigms such as repeated flexion-extension movements, force modulation tasks, drawing tasks) or cognitive-motor tasks (i.e., motor imagery, motor observation and motor prediction). These tasks were executed mainly by right-handed participants. \n\nCrucially, we decided to include a variety of experimental tasks involving different body districts, executed with the right side and\/or the left side or bilaterally. This was done to investigate whether potential aging-related neurofunctional effects might occur regardless of the specific effector and\/or the side used to execute the task. \n\nWe combined a hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm with the coordinate-based ALE. The former allowed us to assess the data according to a factorial design, while the ALE method allowed us to assess the spatial significance of the clusters identified with HC. We assessed whether (i) motor control is associated with aging-related meaningful changes in brain activity, (ii) these modifications depend on the level of task demands and\/or on the specific nature of the motor task, (iii) how these changes can be interpreted in the light of the neurocognitive models of ageing. \n\nIn which brain regions should we expect such effects? One possibility is the involvement of cortical and subcortical areas typically associated with motor control, such as the primary sensorimotor cortices, the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, see . Other possible brain candidates are the regions involved in cognitive-motor tasks, such as fronto-parietal networks activated during motor imagery tasks , but also occipito-temporal regions typically recruited during action prediction and\/or action observation paradigms . \n\nAdmittedly we did not commit ourselves to any of the aforementioned neurocognitive models from the outset: indeed, we consider these not to be necessarily mutually exclusive. Yet, we had clear the specific findings that would be in support of any given theory. \n\nOn the one hand, the HAROLD model would be confirmed by an overactivation of the prefrontal cortices in elderly participants, specifically in association with a good behavioural performance. Since we consider here motor control functions, one possible extension of this model would imply increased bilateral recruitment of sensorimotor regions (see Turesky et al. ). \n\nOn the other hand, the PASA model would be satisfied by a general reduction of the activity of the posterior regions (mainly occipito-temporal), together with a significant increment of activations at the level of the frontal lobe, again associated with the performance level. \n\nFinally, the CRUNCH hypothesis would be met by the observation, in older adults of overactivations at the level of task-specifics brain networks for low-demanding tasks and consequent behavioural performance similar to the young counterparts and hypoactivations in task-specifics brain networks for high-demanding tasks and consequent low-level behavioural performance. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Qualitative description of the behavioural data \n  \nTwenty-one out of 40 studies described a behavioural decline in the elderly participants, suggesting a general deterioration of motor functions associated with the physiological process of aging: older adults showed increased reaction times (RTs, 5 studies), or reduced accuracy (12 studies), or both increased RTs and reduced accuracy (4 studies) during the execution of different motor tasks (see Table\u00a0  and Supplementary Data\u00a0 ).   \nNeuroimaging studies included in the current meta-analysis. \n  \nFor each study, we report the first author, the publication\u2019s year, the technique used, the sample size, the type of task, the performance of the two groups. More details are reported in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . \n  \n\nTo assess whether impaired performance in older adults was more frequently associated with the specific nature of the task, we performed a chi-squared analysis (Factor1, performance: Elderly\u2009=\u2009young\/elderly\u2009<\u2009young, considering both accuracy and RTs data; Factor2, nature of the task: motor execution tasks\/cognitive-motor tasks). The chi-squared test of independence showed that there was no significant association between the level of behavioural performance achieved by the elderly participants and the nature of the task,   X  (1,   N  \u2009=\u200940)\u2009=\u20091.58,   p  \u2009=\u20090.21. \n\n\n### HC and cluster composition analysis (CCA) \n  \nThe HC analysis identified 66 clusters. The mean standard deviation along the three axes was 5.86\u2009mm (  x  -axis), 6.54\u2009mm (  y  -axis) and 6.90\u2009mm (  z  -axis). On average these clusters contained 21 foci (range: 8\u201343). Of these, 22 were retained after the intersection analysis with the ALE map. On average, these overlapping clusters contained 24 foci (range: 10\u201343). Only these clusters were then submitted to a CCA to test the peaks distribution with reference to our factors of interest (group, performance, and task) and their interactions. \n\nGiven the aim of our study of investigating the effects of aging on the neurophysiology of motor control, we will report in the main text only main effects and interactions involving the factor \u201cGroup\u201d (i.e., group-specific clusters, Group-by-Performance interaction, Group-by-Task interaction, and Group-by-Performance-by-Task). The other results are described in the\u00a0  (see also Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 ). \n\n\n### Group-specific clusters \n  \nThe binomial CCA performed on the factor \u201cGroup\u201d revealed that two clusters were significantly associated with the elderly group and two clusters were more frequently activated in the young subjects. The elderly-specific clusters were in the left calcarine fissure (CL6) and left superior occipital gyrus (CL9), while young-specific clusters were located in the left supramarginal gyrus (CL11) and in the right sensorimotor regions (precentral gyrus\/postcentral gyrus, CL45).

Significant main and interaction effects are marked with an asterisk.

These peaks are listed in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . A further classification of peaks forming the sensorimotor clusters based on the effector\/body side is available in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . Based on this last classification, we were able to test the effect called \u201cage-related reduction of hemispheric lateralization\u201d, whereby older adults might show a greater involvement of sensorimotor regions on the same side of the body involved by the task. We observed that this was true for CL45 (right precentral gyrus\/postcentral gyrus). Indeed, the chi-squared analysis (Factor1, Group: Elderly\/Young; Factor2, body side: left\/right) showed a trend of significance (  X  (1,   N  \u2009=\u200915)=3.6,   p  \u2009=\u20090.056): older adults showed a higher number of peaks derived from tasks performed with the right side of the body (#peaks left body side elderly: 5; #peaks left body side young: 4; #peaks right body side elderly: 6; #peaks right body side young: 0; #peaks bilateral body side elderly: 11; #peaks bilateral body side young: 14). \n\n\n### Group-by-performance interaction \n  \nWe identified three clusters showing a significant group-by-performance interaction effect. These were in the left postcentral gyrus (CL12), the left cerebellum (CL39) and the right occipito-temporal cortex (CL66, see Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ). The peaks that contributed to such clusters derived from twelve different studies (left postcentral gyrus, CL12), nine different studies (left cerebellum, CL39) and eleven different studies (right occipito-temporal cortex, CL66). These peaks are listed in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . Moreover, we observed that for CL12 (left postcentral gyrus) older adults showed a similar number of peaks derived from tasks performed with the left- i.e., same- side of the body (  X  (1,   N  \u2009=\u200918)=2.1,   p  \u2009=\u20090.15; #peaks left body side elderly: 4; #peaks left body side young: 5; #peaks right body side elderly: 7; #peaks right body side young: 2; #peaks bilateral body side elderly: 3; #peaks bilateral body side young: 3, Supplementary Data\u00a0 ).

Bottom: Bar plot for the significant group-by-performance interaction, from left to right, in the left precentral\/postcentral gyrus, in the right occipito-temporal cortex and in the right cerebellum. Orange bars indicate the number of peaks of each cluster associated with an equal performance between the elderly and the young group, yellow bars indicate the number of peaks of each cluster associated with a declined performance of the elderly group. Plots source data are provided in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . \n  \n\nThe interaction plots presented in Fig.\u00a0  show that for the right occipito-temporal and for the left sensorimotor cortices there was a more frequent activation in the elderly subjects providing that task performance was balanced across groups (see orange bars). This represents a case of successful compensation. In the case of the left sensorimotor cortex the activation was rather more frequent in young participants when the elderly subjects had a reduced performance (yellow bars), a case of failed compensation. On the other hand, the right cerebellum was more frequently activated by the elderly subjects in case of reduced performance and equally activated by young and elderly subjects in case of similar performance, a case of compensatory attempt. \n\n\n### Group-by-task interaction \n  \nOnly one cluster, located in the right precuneus (CL58), showed a significant group-by-task interaction. The interaction plot presented in Fig.\u00a0  shows that this region is more frequently activated in the elderly during the execution of motor tasks, while in the young group it is recruited only during the cognitive-motor tasks. The peaks that contributed to such cluster derived from eleven different studies, described in Supplementary Data\u00a0 .

Plots source data are provided in Supplementary Data  . \n  \n\nThe inspection of the graph in Fig.\u00a0  shows that the left sensorimotor region was more likely to be associated with the elderly group during the execution of motor execution tasks, when their performance is similar to their young counterparts and with the young participants group during the execution of cognitive-motor tasks, when they achieved a better behavioural performance. \n\nThe inspection of the graph in Fig.\u00a0  shows that this region was more likely to be associated with the elderly group during the execution of cognitive-motor tasks, when their performance is similar to their young counterparts. Interestingly, this cluster falls within the boundaries of a right extra-striate body area  and its detection was associated with cognitive-motor tasks including action observation tasks and motor imagery for body parts . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study reviewed the effects of aging on motor neurophysiology, as assessed using functional imaging measures. We considered all fMRI\/PET studies where both young and elderly subjects were tested with motor paradigms. We classified these experiments based on the specific nature of the task (paradigms involving overt motor execution or cognitive-motor tasks, such as motor imagination\/observation paradigms) and on the level of performance achieved by the elderly participants (similar to young subjects or declined, in terms of accuracy or reaction times). We used this last factor as a \u201cproxy\u201d of task demands. Notably, we included experimental tasks involving different effectors, executed with the right and\/or the left side and\/or bilaterally, to test whether potential aging-related neurofunctional differences might occur regardless of the specific motor task and the specific effector\/side. \n\nOur results indicate that motor control is associated with significant aging-related changes in brain activity. These changes involve not only motoric brain regions but also posterior areas such as the occipito-temporal cortex. Importantly, some of these differences depend on the specific nature of the motor task and\/or on the level of performance achieved by the participants. These results are discussed considering the current neurocognitive models of aging. \n\nBefore entering the details of our neurofunctional results, we want to give a brief qualitative overview of the behavioural patterns associated with aging in the motor domain, considering both accuracy and reaction times measures. \n\nA decline in motor performance has been extensively described for older adults, in terms of movement coordination difficulties (for example, during bimanual movements, see ref.  ), increased variability in action execution , slowing of movements: such problems affect both upper limbs movements as much as gait and balance . In our paper, we focused on motor paradigms adopted for PET\/fMRI experiments. We analysed the motor performance of elderly subjects compared with their younger counterparts, and we observed that behavioural decline in the elderly participants was reported in 21 out of 40 studies. This further testifies the degradation of motor functions associated with the physiological process of aging, whereby older adults showed increased reaction times and\/or reduced accuracy during the execution of a variety of motor tasks. \n\nInterestingly, the decline in motor performance is not directly related to the specific nature of the motor task. A chi-squared analysis failed to find a significant association between (the number of studies reporting) a declined performance and the specific experimental paradigms (broadly classified as explicitly implying a motor act or as \u201ccognitive\u201d in nature, such as motor imagery, action observation). \n\nIn the next paragraph, we will address these changes within the central nervous system, showing how older adults rely on more widespread central nervous system engagement for motor control than young adults. \n\nWe found specific age-related topographical differences in the neurofunctional patterns at the level of the left occipital lobes (calcarine fissure and superior occipital gyrus). These clusters were more frequently activated in the elderly group compared to their younger counterparts. We also reported reduced recruitment of the supramarginal gyrus and of sensorimotor brain regions in elderly group. Notably, this cluster was more frequently associated with the use of the contralateral part of the body for young subjects than for the older ones, independently from the level of performance achieved behaviourally. In other words, in older subjects the cluster contained a proportionally greater number of activation peaks associated with ipsilateral movements. This is in line with the so-called \u201cage-related reduction of hemispheric lateralization\u201d at the level of sensorimotor regions already highlighted by Turskey et al.  in a meta-analysis conducted on motor execution data. \n\nOverall, these findings align with the idea that older adults demonstrate less selective recruitment of brain regions relative to young adults, possibly reflecting a breakdown in the functional segregation achieved after the complete central nervous system maturation . This segregation might represent a process best characterized by an inverted U-shaped trajectory of maturation of visuomotor circuits, from typical development to maturation and then aging, whereby motor performance may initially rely also on visual inspection of what we do . During adulthood, motor control becomes more independent from visual strategies and then back to the dependency on visual control at later stages of life. \n\nHere, the additional occipital activations observed in elderly subjects suggest that they may use a mental visual imagery strategy even to perform explicit motor tasks. The results of the study of Coats and Wann  are in line with this hypothesis. These authors studied young and elderly subjects during reaching and grasping movements, using an apparatus that eventually obscured the target and the approaching hand after allowing an initial visual exploration. For the elderly subjects, both reaching and grasping were affected selectively when visualization of the hand was prevented, with additional reaching movements and longer adjustment times for the grasping phase of the movement . Runnarong et al.  found similar findings, reporting that reach-to-grasp performance deteriorated with age, and the level of performance was specifically affected when the vision of the hand was occluded. Combined with our results, these findings suggest that elderly subjects are more reliant on visual feedback than the younger ones in tasks that require precise manual control. \n\nThe significant group-by-task interaction at the level of the precuneus supports this interpretation: elderly participants activated more frequently this specific region even during motor execution tasks, while their young counterparts recruit the same extra-striate area mainly during cognitive-motor tasks. \n\nTaken together, our significant group effects indicating a more frequent recruitment of occipital regions in elderly subjects during the execution of a variety of motor tasks are in contrast with the hypotheses made by the HAROLD  and the PASA  pattern models, whereby aging should be accompanied by augmented and bilateral recruitment of the frontal lobes and reduced posterior activations. On the contrary, we found reduced brain activations only at the level of sensorimotor cortices. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that, beyond mere group effects, we also found significant interactions between factor age, the level of task performance achieved, and the specific nature of the task with respect to the presence of an overt motor output. These were localized in sensorimotor and occipito-temporal cortices and in the cerebellum. The functional meaning of these interactions varied in the different regions. On the one hand, the interaction in the occipito-temporal cluster can be interpreted as a successful compensation. In this cluster, brain activity was higher in elderly participants when they achieved a level of performance similar to their younger counterparts, while the number of peaks associated with a deteriorated performance was significantly lower. On the other hand, the interaction in sensorimotor regions can be differently interpreted depending on the performance achieved by the older adults: the peaks forming this cluster derived from studies characterized by a declined behaviour, but also from experiments in which the elderly group reach the same performance level of younger subjects. Accordingly, there are indications that the activity in this region can reflect both successful and failed compensatory processes. This latter scenario is explained by the fact that this region is also significantly hypoactivated in the elderly subjects in the presence of a declined performance. \n\nFinally, the interaction at the level of the cerebellum can be seen as an example of dedifferentiation: indeed, the higher number of peaks associated with the elderly subjects comes from studies where their performance was worse than the younger ones. This would be in line with what observed in previous studies: for example, Carp et al.  reported how motor distinctiveness, defined using multivariate pattern analysis, was reduced in older adults in a series of brain regions, including the cerebellum. However, there is one conceptual difficulty when considering the cerebellum in the context of a dedifferentiation hypothesis, given the motoric nature of the tasks behind this result. Indeed, the cerebellum contributes to motor performance in a dynamic manner, with a greater contribution during the learning phase of a new motor skill (see, for example ref.  ). Accordingly, it is conceivable that the more frequent activation of the cerebellum in older adults (when they showed a declined performance) might be due to the fact that they perceived motor tasks as novel and less automatized, as when new motor learning is occurring or as a sign of a lost motor automaticity. \n\nOverall, these results are in line with what hypothesized by the CRUNCH hypothesis . Indeed, we showed that at relatively low levels of task demands\/good performance, one can observe region-specific hyperactivations in older subjects (right occipito-temporal and left sensorimotor clusters). Interestingly, such compensatory overactivations depended on the specific nature of the experimental task, with sensorimotor areas associated with motor execution tasks and posterior regions recruited for cognitive-motor tasks (see the exploration of the three-way interaction). With the increase of the task demands\/decrease of performance, the attempt at compensation becomes less successful, and it can be defined as an unsuccessful attempt or an expression of dedifferentiation processes (right cerebellar cluster). Beyond a certain level of task demands, the elderly brain does not show sufficient activation levels, hence performance declines relative to the younger group (left sensorimotor cluster). Overall, this pattern also supports the idea that the CRUNCH and the dedifferentiation hypotheses might not be incompatible (see for example ref.  ). \n\nWe wish to conclude with a word of caution: while the results of our meta-analysis broadly support the CRUNCH hypothesis , we are aware that to confirm our speculations further and fully support the model, this hypothesis should be formally tested in the same experimental context, for example by parametrically varying the level of task demands within the same experimental paradigm in the same sample of subjects (see ref.  ). \n\nMoreover, we should recognize that our approach cannot entirely test the HAROLD model and its adaptation to motor control (the so-called \u201csensorimotor lateralization hypothesis\u201d), since we included experimental tasks executed with both body sides (and different effectors). This was done to investigate whether potential aging-related neurofunctional effects might occur regardless of the specific effector and\/or the side used to execute the task. However, it should be acknowledged that most of the constituent studies employed hand movement tasks, which confines foci to a limited spot along the sensorimotor cortices. \n\nFinally, when investigating individual differences among older adults, it is important to consider the limitations of cross-sectional designs compared with longitudinal designs. For example, older participants are typically recruited only from the subset of well-educated people aged in relatively good health and are free of brain disease, whereas the young adult samples with which they are compared are more heterogeneous. Cross-sectional study designs can also be contaminated by birth cohort effects, including inter-generational IQ increases. Although they have their limitations, longitudinal study designs can avoid these problems. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nOur meta-analytical approach involves a series of analytical steps starting from the identification of the raw data (data collection and data preparation), followed by HC and statistical inferences on the clusters, which comprise a CCA. These procedures are described in detail below. \n\n### Data collection and preparation \n  \nWe identified neuroimaging studies exploring the neural correlates of motor control during either motor execution tasks or non-execution cognitive-motor tasks (i.e., motor imagery, motor observation and motor prediction) in young and elderly individuals, using the following procedures. \n\nFirst, we entered the following queries in PubMed ( ): \u201cfMRI and ageing and action\u201d, \u201cfMRI and aging and action\u201d, \u201cfMRI and older and action\u201d, \u201cfMRI and age and action\u201d, \u201cfMRI and ageing and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cfMRI and aging and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cfMRI and older and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cfMRI and age and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cfMRI and ageing and premotor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and aging and premotor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and older and premotor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and age and premotor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and ageing and motor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and aging and motor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and older and motor\u201d, \u201cfMRI and age and motor\u201d, \u201cPET and ageing and action\u201d, \u201cPET and aging and action\u201d, \u201cPET and older and action\u201d, \u201cPET and age and action\u201d, \u201cPET and ageing and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cPET and aging and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cPET and older and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cPET and age and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cPET and ageing and premotor\u201d, \u201cPET and aging and premotor\u201d, \u201cPET and older and premotor\u201d, \u201cPET and age and premotor\u201d, \u201cPET and ageing and motor\u201d, \u201cPET and aging and motor\u201d, \u201cPET and older and motor\u201d, \u201cPET and age and motor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and ageing and action\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and aging and action\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and older and action\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and age and action\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and ageing and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and aging and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and older and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and age and [motor control]\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and ageing and premotor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and aging and premotor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and older and premotor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and age and premotor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and ageing and motor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and aging and motor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and older and motor\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging and age and motor\u201d. The initial set of studies included 20115 papers, updated to February 2021. \n\nSecond, after the removal of duplicates, we ran a preliminary selection based on the titles and abstracts of the papers, through which we included the studies that matched the following criteria: studies including both healthy young and older adults; studies reporting whole-brain activation peaks (no region-of-interest analyses) either from each group independently or from contrasts of the two groups; data reported using stereotactic coordinates (either MNI or Talairach atlases); task-based fMRI studies (no resting-state studies); univariate statistical analyses. \n\nConversely, we excluded the studies that matched the following criteria: studies that used neuroimaging methods other than task-based PET\/fMRI studies, such as resting-state fMRI, PET, SPECT, or other non-fMRI procedures, to exclude variability across different neuroimaging findings; studies that assessed the effect of medication or other treatments without reporting fMRI data at baseline; studies analysed with a priori region of interest approach. \n\nThis selection, initially based on titles and then on abstracts, yielded to the identification of 161 candidate papers for the meta-analysis. Third, we made a further selection by inspecting the entire manuscripts and applying the aforementioned inclusion criteria in detail. Further, we conducted an up-to-date manual scan of the references of the selected articles, to ensure that all relevant papers had been included. For the suitable studies, we considered data derived from (i) within group simple effects and (ii) between group comparisons. We\u00a0also incorporated within group data to have a more complete survey on whether a given brain region was differentially activated across groups, while still being active in each group above a given conventional threshold, or whether the region, besides being significantly associated with one group, it never reached statistically significant effects in the other group. The flowchart of the selection process is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 . \n\nBy applying such criteria, we included 40 papers , 142 contrasts and 1200 activation foci (857 peaks relative to elderly group and 343 peak relative to young group). A detailed description of the experimental paradigms is provided in Supplementary Data\u00a0 . \n\nTo arrange the dataset for the subsequent cluster composition analysis (CCA, see below for the details), each focus of activation was classified according to the three factors of interest: group (Elderly vs young), level of achieved behavioural performance (Elderly\u2009=\u2009young vs Elderly\u2009<\u2009young) and specific nature of the task (Motor execution paradigms vs cognitive-motor paradigms). All the Talairach coordinates were converted to MNI space using the Talairach to MNI transformation implemented in GingerALE , version 2.3.6. Twenty-eight out of 1270 foci were excluded from the dataset because they fell outside, even from the less conservative brain boundary mask of the GingerALE software. \n\nThe final dataset comprised 1349 participants, 616 elderly and 607 young participants. Please note that 126 participants cannot be assigned to the young\/elderly group since in the original studies participants were not divided in two groups and authors performed a regression analysis on a single group using the variable age as covariate (see refs.  ). Even if some of the included papers were from the same group of authors , there was no overlapping of participants across the different studies. \n\nThe elderly group age range was 58-80, while the age range for the young group was 21\u201331. \n\n\n### HC analysis and CCA \n  \nTo identify anatomically coherent regional effects, we first performed a HC analysis using the unique-solution clustering algorithm developed by Cattinelli et al. . This method is implemented in a suite of MATLAB (2014a MathWorks) and C++ scripts called CluB (Clustering the Brain ). The CluB toolbox permits both to extract a set of spatially coherent clusters of activations from a database of stereotactic coordinates, and to explore each single cluster of activation for its composition according to the cognitive dimensions of interest. Crucially, this last step, called \u201ccluster composition analysis\u201d, permits to explore neurocognitive effects by adopting a factorial-design logic and by testing the working hypotheses using either asymptotic tests, or exact tests either in a classic inference, or in a Bayesian-like context. This is something that cannot be done with GingerALE. Indeed, meta-analyses based on ALE are limited by the need of testing regional functional anatomical effects from highly homogeneous studies permitting, at the most, the evaluation of the neurofunctional differences (e.g., Group A\u2009>\u2009Group B) and commonalities (e.g., conjunction effect of Group A & Group B) between two classes of studies. The software cannot test more complex factorial models, the level of analysis needed for a complex neurocognitive scenario like the one behind aging and the nature of the task\/level of the performance achieved. \n\nSpecifically, the CluB toolbox considers the squared Euclidean distance between each pair of foci included in the dataset. The clusters with minimal dissimilarity are recursively merged using Ward\u2019s criterion , to minimize the intra-cluster variability and maximizing the between-cluster sum of squares . To impose a suitable a priori spatial resolution to our analyses, we set this to be 7\u2009mm in terms of the maximum mean spatial variance within each cluster in the three directions (full width half maximum, FWHM). The centroid coordinates of each resulting cluster were then labelled according to the automatic anatomic labelling (AAL) and then controlled by visual inspection on the MRIcron  visualization software. \n\nThe output of the HC analysis was then entered as an input for the subsequent CCA. This procedure allows a post-hoc statistical exploration of each cluster by computing, within each cluster, the proportion of foci belonging to different levels of a variable of interest. Such proportion is then compared with a target proportion, which, in our case, is extracted from the overall distribution of foci classified according to our factors of interest in the whole dataset (prior likelihood, PL). First, we ran a CCA to explore the main effects of group, nature of the task, and level of performance. This composition analysis was done by running a two-sided binomial test on the proportion of foci associated with each level of the three factors within each cluster. For example, if a cluster X had a cardinality of   N  \u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200920 and included 15 foci associated with the level \u201cElderly\u201d of the \u201cgroup\u201d factor, CluB computes the proportion 15\/20 (i.e., 0.75) and compares it with the theoretical proportion computed over the entire dataset (e.g., young\/elderly\u2009=\u2009377\/650\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.58). Hence, (a) the Prior Likelihood represents the probability of success under the null hypothesis and (b) a significant binomial test (  p  \u2009\u2009<\u2009\u2009.05) indicates that the proportion of activation peaks included in that specific part of the brain is higher than the proportion computed all over the brain. Afterwards, to test for interaction effects (group-by-task, group-by-performance, and task-by-performance), we performed a series of two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact tests  on the empirical peak-distribution within each cluster. Despite not being associated with a formal statistical test, the same procedure was applied to explore, descriptively, eventual three-way interaction effects (i.e., group-by-task-by-performance interaction). \n\n\n### Validation of the spatial relevance of each cluster using the ALE procedure \n  \nAs the HC procedure does not provide a statistical test of the spatial significance of the resulting clusters, this can be compensated for by searching for spatial convergence between the clustering solution and the results of an activation likelihood estimate ALE-based meta-analysis on the same overall dataset (see, for example refs.  ). For the spatial cross-validation with ALE we employed the Turkeltaub Non-Additive method , with the general statistical threshold set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE corrected (cluster-level). The resulting maps were overlapped with the HC map with the \u201cintersection\u201d function in the software MRIcron (https:\/\/  ). Only the clusters that fell in this intersection map were then considered for further analyses (the CCA) and discussion. \n\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility \n  \nThe details about statistics used in different data analyses performed in this study are given in the methods section. \n\nIn short, we first performed a hierarchical clustering analysis using the unique-solution clustering algorithm developed by Cattinelli et al. , to identify anatomically coherent regional effects. This method is implemented in a suite of MATLAB (2014a MathWorks) and C++ scripts called CluB (Clustering the Brain ). \n\nThe output of the HC analysis was then entered as an input for the subsequent CCA. This procedure allows a post-hoc statistical exploration of each cluster by computing, within each cluster, the proportion of foci belonging to different levels of a variable of interest performing a series of two-sided binomial tests. \n\nFurthermore, we performed a series of two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact tests  on the empirical peak-distribution within each cluster in order to test for interaction effects (group-by-task, group-by-performance, and task-by-performance). \n\nDespite not being associated with a formal statistical test, the same procedure was applied to explore, descriptively, eventual three-way interaction effects (i.e., group-by-task-by-performance interaction). \n\nAs the HC procedure does not provide a statistical test of the spatial significance of the resulting clusters, this can be compensated for by searching for spatial convergence between the clustering solution and the results of an ALE-based meta-analysis on the same overall dataset. We employed the Turkeltaub Non-Additive method , with the general statistical threshold set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE corrected (cluster-level). \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8776875,"text_md5":"17d349b44439a8f0fc311042a490ae5a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,56],"journal":[57,68],"publication_year":[70,74],"title":[85,201],"keywords":[215,235],"abstract":[248,1923],"body":[1932,52974]},"batch":1,"pmid":35058549,"doi":"10.1038\/s42003-022-03027-2","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8776875","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8776875"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8776875\">8776875<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8776875  How the motor system copes with aging: a quantitative meta-analysis of the effect of aging on motor function control"}

Despite an increase in children neuroimaging studies, a comprehensive neuropsychological model of mathematical functions in children is lacking. Using quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we identify concordant brain areas across articles that adhere to a set of selection criteria (e.g., whole-brain analysis, coordinate reports) and report brain activity to tasks that involve processing symbolic and non-symbolic numbers with and without formal mathematical operations, which we called respectively number tasks and calculation tasks. We present data on children 14 years and younger, who solved these tasks. Results show activity in parietal (e.g., inferior parietal lobule and precuneus) and frontal (e.g., superior and medial frontal gyri) cortices, core areas related to mental-arithmetic, as well as brain regions such as the insula and claustrum, which are not typically discussed as part of mathematical problem solving models. We propose a topographical atlas of mathematical processes in children, discuss findings within a developmental constructivist theoretical model, and suggest practical methodological considerations for future studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \nFrom an early age we learn to live in a world with numbers: on classroom doors, street signs, price tags, our phones, on our work activities. Typically we learn how numbers and quantities relate to each other (e.g., smaller, larger) from an early age; and most of us received some formal training in math, starting from grade school. Grade school training in mathematics coincides with protracted development of the pre-frontal cortex (e.g.,  ). The pre-frontal cortex is a key brain region, concordant across mathematical-cognition studies in healthy adults ( , for meta-analyses). Much progress has been made in understanding brain correlates of mathematical cognition; however, despite the increase in the studies examining children\u2019s mathematical problem solving (i.e., quantity discrimination and mathematical operations), a neuropsychological model for children is still not available. We have compiled data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and report concordant findings on brain correlates of typically developing children when solving math tasks with and without formal calculations (i.e., operations). \n\nBehavioral protocols with children can be designed using math tasks such as printing or naming numbers, counting and sorting objects ( ,  ). Neuroimaging tasks, however, are largely restricted to the visual domain, because they need to adhere to constraints\/limitations of the imaging methodology ( ,  ,  ). For fMRI studies, task protocols must be as time limited as possible. For instance, stimulus presentation should be brief, a few seconds; longer intervals are harder to control for irrelevant intruding processes (e.g., mind wandering). Manual responses are preferable to verbal responses, being less likely to produce head motion that compromise image quality. Moreover, calculation tasks are typically simple, often 1- or 2- digit operations, so that participants can provide a response within a limited time frame. Most fMRI studies that examine brain correlates of mathematical cognition, either in children or adults, follow these basic task characteristics. \n\nThe majority of fMRI studies in the literature investigated mathematical cognition in adults (e.g.,  ,  ), and the parietal lobes received the most attention in early studies of mental arithmetic. Indeed, parietal brain regions, such as bilateral intraparietal sulci, left angular gyrus, and bilateral superior parietal cortices, play distinct roles in number processing ( ). Although the parietal cortex is fundamental to process mathematical problems, other regions are involved as well ( ,  ,  ,  ). Coordinate-based meta-analyses of 53 adult fMRI studies show areas, such as cingulate gyri, insula and the prefrontal cortex that are concordantly active in tasks of numbers and calculation ( ). \n\n Number tasks   are those that contain numbers (e.g., viewing different digits) and quantities (e.g., viewing small or large arrays of dots), but require no formal calculation (e.g., multiplication). They have in common some sort of semantic judgement on numbers or quantities based on stipulated rules.   Calculation tasks   require as well operation rules, such as addition, subtraction and multiplication, applied to numbers. Distinct and common brain areas are active in adults during number and calculation tasks ( ). Specifically, they elicit brain responses within regions such as inferior parietal lobule and inferior frontal cortex; however, calculations also recruit prefrontal areas, particularly in middle and superior frontal gyri ( ). \n\nThe first fMRI study with children was published 16 years ago, by  , testing children with or without a velocardiofacial syndrome, on an arithmetic task. fMRI studies of children working on mathematical problems are gradually increasing. As in adult studies, tasks administered to children divide into those investigating numerical processes (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ) and those studying mathematical operations (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nStudies that examine numerical processes typically ask children to select the larger number in a set of numbers (e.g.,  ). The numbers in the set can differ by either small differences\/distance (i.e., 1, 2 and 3) or large (i.e., 5, 6, and 7) ones. When the difference is small, children show activity in the superior parietal lobe, medial and inferior frontal gyri, the insula, and subcortical regions \u2212 mostly in the right hemisphere ( ). A subsequent study by the same researchers shows that when number differences are large, children activate the left hemisphere\u2019s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus ( ). Other studies compared brain responses to numbers versus responses to shapes ( ); or examined numerical processes versus a control task ( ). \n\nProcedural differences in mathematical operations often lead to activity in different cortical regions ( ,  ). Studies examining various operations in the same children are important:   examined brain responses to subtraction and multiplication, and   examined three mathematical operations, addition, subtraction and multiplication. They found several common brain regions associated with them all. In the prefrontal cortex, for instance, addition and subtraction recruit the left middle frontal cortex, whereas multiplication recruits left middle and inferior frontal cortices ( ); further, unlike addition and multiplication, subtraction elicited activity in the right intraparietal sulcus. More fMRI studies are needed that examine multiple mathematical operations in the same children. \n\nA meta-analysis by   reports concordance across seven fMRI studies, which tested children with either number or calculation tasks, in right inferior and middle frontal gyri, left superior frontal gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus. This meta-analysis supports the view that prefrontal regions play an important role in mathematical cognition ( ,  ,  ).   did not detect extensive involvement of parietal cortex, which is critical in mathematical cognition, possibly because of variability in the original studies\u2019 methodology and the low number of foci. Another meta-analysis examined 19 fMRI studies that included children ( ). Perhaps due to the low number of studies, the authors ( ) chose to include studies with fixed effects analyses (e.g.  ,  ), coordinates from contrasts with variable performance (i.e., interaction of brain activity of high and low performers,  ), and variable age (i.e., coordinates resulting from a conjunction analysis between children and adults,  ); they also included age ranges spanning over participants older than 18 years (i.e., 8.53\u201319.03 years,  ). Although such approach increases the number of studies and coordinates in the meta-analyses, it obscures the reliability of results. \n\nTargeted meta-analyses were recently performed to identify brain correlates of number processing and notation (i.e., symbolic vs non-symbolic) in adults ( ) and children ( ). These studies suggest a network of parietal and frontal areas that underlie symbolic and non-symbolic processes. Based mainly on adult data theoretical models of mathematical cognition (e.g.,  ,  ) may not be suitable for accounting for developmental data ( ). Also, it is challenging to identify developmental theories of cognition that make clear neural predictions on mathematical processes. We used a domain general cognitive theory of development for hypotheses building. The Theory of Constructive Operators ( ,  ,  ) outlines brain correlates associated with schemes and operation types to predict performance. The theory of constructive operators would predict that brain responses to number and calculations tasks are not material-driven, but process-driven and vary with the trade-off between participants\u2019 mental-attentional capacity and the mental demand of the task. Specifically, this trade-off predicts that the right hemisphere is involved in processing of automatized schemes, whereas the left hemisphere is involved in processing problems that involve the child\u2019s mental-attentional capacity, and are not automatized yet (details on this account is given in the discussion). Thus, we anticipated that number tasks should favour right frontal and parietal regions, whereas calculation tasks within the child\u2019s mental-attentional capacity will recruit additional frontal and parietal regions in the left hemisphere. In the current meta-analyses we explore brain areas involved in mathematical cognition of children younger than 14 years, and provide normative fMRI atlases in standard stereotaxic space for number and calculation tasks. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and article selection criteria \n  \nThe literature was searched, in June 2017, by means of web-of-science ( ), using the terms fMRI and arithmetic and children; fMRI and calculations and children; fMRI and math and children; and fMRI and numerical and children. We have also added five papers using manual search.   shows the number of articles from this search, and the process we followed to identify eligible articles. Specifically, after eliminating duplicates, the articles were subjected to a series of selection criteria. For inclusion articles needed to: (a) be written in English, (b) have used fMRI and tasks involving numbers and mathematical operations; (c) have healthy children participants as the main or control group; (d) have reported whole-brain, within-group results using random-effects analysis; (e) have reported stereotaxic coordinates in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates. Forty-three articles survived these criteria. To maintain data independence, we eliminated articles that reported contrast with analyses involving other age groups (e.g., conjunction between children and adults) and\/or other tasks (e.g., conjunction between working memory and arithmetic problem solving). We also eliminated articles that included participants over 18 years in the children group (i.e., age range 8.53\u201319.03 years.  ; age range 7.7\u201321 years,  ; mean age 17 years 11.5 months,  ), and one article for including the same experiments (i.e., contrasts) using same participants in different publications ( ,  ). These controls resulted in 32 acceptable articles testing children 14 years or younger.   \nPRISMA flowchart for identification and eligibility of articles (template by  ). n\u202f=\u202fnumber of papers. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nContrast coordinates were selected based on whether the experimental paradigm was related either to number tasks or calculation tasks.   Number tasks   were defined as those involved in numerical processing without having prescribed operations (e.g., number-distance effects, numerical comparisons). In the number tasks meta-analyses we included data from 18 independent subject-groups that included 30 experiments (i.e., contrasts) using symbolic (i.e., Arabic) stimuli ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), non-symbolic (e.g., dots) stimuli ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), or a combination of both ( ,  ).   Calculation tasks   were defined as tasks that involved prescribed mathematical operations \u2212 addition, subtraction or multiplication. Included among calculation tasks were 42 experiments from 18 independent subject groups that used symbolic stimuli, with three exceptions: one paper using non-symbolic stimuli ( ) and two others having a combination of symbolic and non-symbolic stimuli ( ,  ). Insufficient experiments (less than 17\u201320 experiments;  ) did not allow us to examine operations separately. Similarly, due to insufficient data of symbolic and non-symbolic experiments in children under 14 years, we could not investigate the hypothesis of whether numbers have abstract or multiple representations (e.g.,  ). Three experimenters (MA, MPL and MS) performed contrast selection separately, and final decisions were taken in agreement.   shows article information, participant demographics, and contrast selection for each category.   \nDescriptive information of articles and contrasts used in the meta-analyses. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Meta-analyses \n  \nActivation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) is a coordinate-based meta-analytic method ( ,  ,  ). Foci from experiments (i.e., contrast coordinates) from selected articles are used to generate 3D maps indicating the likelihood of activation within a given voxel of a template brain ( ). Data are compared against a random spatial distribution (i.e., noise) to identify the likelihood of significant clusters. A whole-brain statistical map of ALE scores is generated that estimate the probability of the significance of a brain region being active during a given cognitive function. \n\nALE meta-analyses were computed using GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ). First, MNI coordinates were transformed into Talairach space using the best-fit MNI-to-Talairach transformation ( ). Each meta-analysis (i.e., number and calculation tasks) contains foci from all possible relevant experiments as the analyses algorithm minimizes within-group effects and provides increase power ( ,  ). We report brain areas that survived an uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p\u202f<\u202f0.001 with a cluster-level correction at p\u202f<\u202f0.05 for multiple comparisons ( ,  ). Contrast analyses are performed on images corrected for multiple comparisons with cluster level p\u202f=\u202f0.05 and uncorrected p\u202f=\u202f0.001, thus the threshold for contrast number tasks vs calculation tasks is set to p\u202f=\u202f0.01 uncorrected, with 5000 permutations and minimum volume 50\u202fmm  (e.g.,  ). For displaying results from ALE maps we employed AFNI ( ). \n\nFor comparison we performed meta-analyses of fMRI data that examine number and calculation tasks with adults (methods and result presented in supplementary material). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nMean age and\/or age range of children in the meta-analyses for all experiments are shown on  . The average age of children included in the meta-analyses was calculated to be 9.34\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.18 years for number tasks and 9.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.4 years for calculation tasks. Of the articles reporting gender, 44% and 52% of participants were female for number and calculation tasks, respectively. About 75% of the all articles reported handedness and tested right-handed participants with the exception of five left-handed participants in the sample for calculation tasks. \n\n### ALE maps \n  \n#### Number tasks \n  \nIn children, number tasks are associated with significant ALE values in the inferior parietal lobule Brodmann area (BA 40) extending to parts of the inferior parietal sulcus, claustrum and insula (BA 13) in the right hemisphere ( ,  ).   \nConcordant areas for processing number and calculation tasks in children. \n  Table 2           \n3D rendered ALE activation maps superimposed on an anatomical brain. All regions survived cluster level correction p\u202f=\u202f0.05 for multiple comparison control at an uncorrected p\u202f=\u202f0.001. All coordinates are listed in  . \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n#### Calculation tasks \n  \nWhen solving mathematical operations children activate a diverse set of areas ( ;  ). The largest cluster is centered on the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) and extends to the right medial frontal gyrus (BA 8) and cingulate gyrus (BA 32). The second largest cluster with the highest likelihood for being detected is found in the right insula (BA 13). Concordance in parietal areas is observed bilaterally; left precuneus (BA 19) and inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) including parts of the inferior parietal sulcus and angular gyrus BA 39, and right precuneus BA 7. The left claustrum has the second highest likelihood of being detected. A cluster centered on the left precentral gyrus (BA 6) encompasses also grey matter in the inferior and middle frontal gyri (BA 9). \n\n\n#### Contrast: number tasks vs calculation tasks \n  \nIn children, compared to calculation tasks, number tasks show no suprathresholed clusters. Compared to number tasks, calculation tasks show increase concordance in the right cingulate gyrus (BA 32), bilateral medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), right precuneus (BA 7), bilateral insula and left claustrum, ( ). Areas that show concordance in conjunction between number and calculation tasks are the claustrum and insula (BA 13) in the right hemisphere ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBrain activity related to mathematical cognition in typically developing children was examined using coordinate-based ALE meta-analyses. Children activate a varied set of areas in established parietal and frontal regions when solving problems with numbers and operations. We highlight the role of insula and claustrum in mathematical operations because these regions have not been previously emphasized in this sort of cognition. To facilitate discussion, we organized findings by cortical regions, and for each we indicate characteristics of activity (e.g., its extent or magnitude) and the categories (i.e., number and calculation tasks), which elicit the activity. We build on previous models ( ,  ) to offer a topographical model and a theoretical interpretation of mathematical cognition in children. \n\nNumber and calculation tasks elicit responses in the parietal lobes in children. This is a critical region linked to mathematical problem solving ( ). Specifically, the first and most concordant cluster for number tasks is in the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), where complex (concrete or abstract) effort-demanding (non-automatized) objects are found (e.g.,  ,  ). The left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) is activated during calculation tasks \u2212 sites for \u201cactive\u201d complex objects that can receive transformations\/operations (e.g.,  ). The critical role of the inferior parietal lobule in mathematical cognition has been discussed extensively in adults ( ,  , for reviews) and children ( ,  ). The current findings are consistent with previous reports; and highlight a hemispheric dominance for number tasks in the right hemisphere, in contrast to calculation tasks driven by the left hemisphere. \n\nWhen children solve mathematical operations, areas with the highest likelihood of being detected appear in the right insular cortex for calculation tasks. The left claustrum also shows one of the highest values of significant concordance for calculation tasks. The insula and claustrum are also concordant in a smaller cluster for number tasks. The insula is a structure that connects the temporal and frontal lobes deep within the lateral fissure; the claustrum borders the insula medially. Initially, the insula became known for its involvement in affective processes (for meta-analyses, see  ,  ). Its role in the interaction of cognition, emotion and interoception has also been discussed ( ). Such interpretations of insular role are consistent with the hypothesis that, together with the anterior cingulate, insula may be involved in intrinsically motivated behaviours ( ,  ,  ,  ). The insula, together with subcordical structures such as the basal ganglia, have been implicated in studies that involve learning and training ( ). The role of the claustrum is often bundled with the functions of the insula; however, this is a distinct region anatomically ( ), and in terms of structural connectivity ( ). Recent reviews suggest the claustrum to function as a cross-modal integrator to create conscious percepts ( ,  , for reviews). Thus, we propose that for children solving mathematical operations, high activation in the insula may express their   intrinsic motivation   in the task, with reference to learning and training. For the claustrum, we propose that it helps integrate motivated top-down and bottom-up processes. Importantly, neither the insula nor the claustrum have been implicated in models of mathematical cognition, although the current findings suggest that these areas are critical. \n\nAnother critical region for calculation tasks is the cingulate gyrus (BA 32), which extends medially from superior frontal (BA 6) and medial frontal (BA 8) gyri. The cingulate gyrus is also a key region for mental-attention and working memory, since it may be where affective intentions convert into cognitive goals ( ,  ). Significant clusters of concordant activity in the dorsal cingulate gyrus (BA 32) are observed for calculation tasks in children. The cingulate gyri have been related to various higher order cognitive activities. Progressively more evidence highlights its role as a coordinator of activity in multiple attentional systems ( ), multimodal functions ( ), and as coordinating activity based on task complexity ( ). We suggest that in children cingulate gyri integrate affective motives and available information to generate solutions involving specific cognitive goals. \n\nCalculation tasks also elicit concordance in a cluster in the left precentral gyrus (BA 6) that extends to inferior and middle frontal gyri (BA 9). The middle frontal gyri, often referred to as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, are associated with executive-driven mental attention and working memory ( ,  ,  ). Compared to inferior frontal cortices, which are associated with simpler cognitive actions, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex implication in coordinated cognitive control of complex processes is important, and it was identified as such early on ( ,  ,  ). Studies of mathematical cognition do associate activity in middle frontal gyri with procedural complexity and working memory processes ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). This hypothesis is supported by adult data, which show that middle frontal gyri are implicated in calculation tasks but not in number tasks ( ). We have replicated the latter finding with adult meta-analyses of number and calculation tasks (Table S2). \n\n### Topographical model of mental-arithmetic in children \n  \nThere is a close agreement on brain locations implicated in children and adults during mathematical problem solving (Table S2\u2013S3;  ), and predictions by the triple-code model ( ). The only unaccounted brain region by either the triple-code model ( ) and the adult meta-analyses is the claustrum, which was concordant for children. A critical difference we observe is that children implicate the right insula (BA 13) more extensively than adults in calculation tasks, whereas adults implicate more prefrontal areas (BA 44, 46, 10; Table S3). We provide a theoretical framework that may explain these findings in the next section.   \nMapping results on children meta-analyses (in red), on triple-code model (green), and adult meta-analyses (orange). We illustrate in green the schematized cortical locations of the triple-code model proposed by  ,  : (1) Inferior parietal cortex: quantity representation, (2) Temporal cortex: visual-computational number symbols, (3) Articulatory loop, (4) Verbal system, (5) Basal ganglia: arithmetic facts, (6) Thalamus: arithmetic facts, and (7) Prefrontal cortex: strategy choice and planning. In orange are additional schematic locations of areas concordant among adult studies, as demonstrated by meta-analyses ( ): (a) Superior frontal BA 10: formulates complex goals, sub-goal creation, (b) Middle frontal BA 46: in more or less misleading situations it monitors more than a few items, (c) Inferior frontal BA 9: monitor simple rules or a few items, (d) Precentral gyrus: eye movements, (e) Insula: interoceptive motivation of goal-directed and default-mode processes, (f) Cingulate gyrus: converts affective goals into cognitive goals to be implemented, (g) Right angular gyrus: visual-spatial fact retrieval (i.e., spatial-temporal schemes with non-verbalizable configural relations), and (h) Cerebellum: goal directed, visual motor sequencing. Sub-cortical regions specific to meta-analyses of number or calculation tasks were not depicted. Here we added the (i) right basal ganglia: coordination of top-down and bottom-up operative\/motor processes. In red are schematic locations of areas concordant among children studies, as demonstrated by the current meta-analyses. (j) Claustrum: integration of motivated top-down and bottom-up processes. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n### Developmental theory: the theory of constructive operators (TCO) \n  \nThe Theory of Constructive Operators (TCO) is a general, constructivist theory of development and learning ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). It provides a mathematical model for predicting developmental stages ( ,  ,  ,  ). The TCO is framed in terms of organismic   operators   (content-free brain utilities, i.e., regulations or general controls),   schemes   (contextual information carriers \u2212 cell assemblies or networks), and, finally, organizing   principles   ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ;  ). Operators are general-purpose and content free resources, which can apply on schemes in any domain.   provides a short description and basic brain location of operators in the TCO.   suggests how operators interact with schemes to elicit performance. Psychologically, schemes are self-propelling information-bearing units (cell assemblies or networks), which can be classified into three groups: executive, operative (action blue-prints), and figurative (object or feature representations). Thus, schemes carry information that can appear under three distinct categories: figurative, operative, and executive (Pascual-Pascual-Leone and Baillargeon, 1994;  ): (a)   figurative schemes   are perceptions and representations of concepts or objects (e.g., in the case of numbers: symbolic 3 or \u2605\u2605\u2605); (b)   operative schemes   correspond to actions and specific procedures, applicable to objects or concepts (e.g., in the case of math, the act of multiplying 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3); and (c)   executive schemes,   a subdivision of operative schemes, that carry general contextualized procedures (e.g., in the case of math, to plan the order of steps for solving 3\u202f+\u202f3\/(3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3)). The currently activated and dominant set of compatible executive schemes can function as an operator (which we call   E   for executive).   E   can regulate or control the current functioning of other operators (e.g.,   M-   or   I-  operator;  ) as they apply to modify schemes in their here-and-now dynamism (e.g.,  ,  ,  ).   \nDescription of Operators and their Corresponding Brain Regions in their Likely Evolutionary Order (after  ;  ). \n  Table 3     \nA simplified illustration of the Theory of Constructive Operators (TCO): Operators (in green; operator definitions are listed in  ), schemes (in blue), and the principle of schematic over-determination of performance \u2212 or SOP (in red). \n  Fig. 4   \n\nA principle of Schematic Overdetermination of Performance (  SOP \u2212  ,  ,  ,  , expresses both the spreading of activation in the brain, and its   final common path   of neuronal resolution into a performance \u2212 which is a generalized version of Sherrington\u2019s original idea ( ,  ). This   SOP   determines which set of compatible and dominant schemes eventually will apply to generate an outcome. Mutually incompatible schemes compete, and those more strongly activated eventually apply. \n\n\n### Integrating neuroimaging data and the TCO \n  \nOur findings have important theoretical and practical implications. Practically they provide coordinates in stereotaxic space that future studies may benefit from. Theoretically, they offer support for developmental theories that follow process-specific rather than content-specific approaches ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). To clarify this issue we distinguish processes across four main dimensions of variation: (a) operative versus figurative processing, (b) complexity levels of processing, (c) left- versus right-hemisphere processing, and (d) motivation and self-control. \n\n#### Operative versus figurative \n  \nWe suggest that operative processes and executive schemes are expressed in frontal and prefrontal areas, respectively, whereas representations and figurative\/object schemes are expressed in parietal, temporal and occipital areas ( ,  ). This is in agreement with early neurologists who viewed the brain as separating distinct, different modes of processing (e.g.,  ). It is important to explain why more operative processes and executive schemes are needed when solving calculations, expressed by additional brain activity in frontal and prefrontal areas. A clear distinction between the operative processes implicated in calculation tasks versus number tasks is found in adults (Table S2\u2013S3), consistent with past meta-analyses ( ). Operative processes are also important in children\u2019s math tasks, as expressed by the involvement of prefrontal and sub-lobar regions, including insular cortex, during these tasks. \n\n\n#### Complexity levels in processing \n  \nAssociation areas may in some sense express level of   processing   required by a task. Consider that both   operative   (motor, efferent associative) and   figurative   (sensorial, afferent associative) schemes can be organized in context-sensitive   heterarchical   ways (i.e., functionally-flexible hierarchies). These heterarchies were first described by classic neuropsychologists (e.g.,  ,  ) as functionally nested sequences of   primary   areas (afferent or efferent \u2212 e.g., BA 4, and BA 1, 2, 3 and BA 17),   secondary   areas (coordination of local unimodal processes \u2212 e.g., BA 6, and BA 5, and BA 18),   tertiary   areas (coordination of   regional multimodal   areas \u2212 e.g., BA 8 and BA 7, BA 19), and finally   general multimodal   areas, also called   high tertiary or quaternary   (which are functionally generic, applicable across domains, and integrating the totality of regional multimodal processing \u2212 e.g., BA 9, BA 47, BA 46, BA 10, BA 39, BA 40). Distinguishing levels of processing complexity of a task is key for predicting and interpreting mathematical performance. In our data we find, for instance, that number tasks in children implicate secondary and tertiary association areas, whereas calculation tasks elicit activity in more tertiary areas. \n\n\n#### Left hemisphere versus right hemisphere processing \n  \nTraditionally semantic-pragmatic differences between left and right hemispheres, have been verbal-analytical versus visuospatial-global processing, respectively ( ). However, this is no longer tenable as a main distinction between left versus right hemispheres \u2212 because we find that both hemispheres activate with both content types (i.e., verbal and visual-spatial). Within a constructivist-developmental viewpoint, we claim that propensities fostered by left hemisphere are best characterized as   analytical mental-attentional processing   (or novel, effortful working-memory) \u2212 often in   demanding   problem-solving situations; whereas right hemisphere fosters propensities of   overlearned or automatized processing   that engage in either very easy or very difficult tasks ( ,  ,  ).   shows circumstances that give rise to right or left hemisphere dominance by considering the novelty of task, mental-demand (  Md  ) of the task and mental-attentional capacity (  Mc  ) of the individual ( ,  ). A trade-off between   Md\/Mc   can be used to predict hemispheric dominance such that when   Md\u202f<<\u202fMc   processing would favour the right hemisphere, when   Md\u202f  \u2264\u202f  Mc   processing would favour the left hemisphere and when   Md\u202f>>\u202fMc   processing would favour the right hemisphere. This distinction is novel with respect to the function of right hemisphere, which would be implicated in two different sorts of instances: (a) In more or less automatized (very easy) processes, or (b) when the needed mental-attentional resources are above and beyond what the individual has available (i.e., above his\/her mental-attentional capacity;  ). In the latter case, when a task\u2019s mental attentional demand is too high for the left hemisphere to cope with alone, the right hemisphere is mobilized in search of potentially useful overlearned or automatized schemes. For instance, in the current data ( ) we see that the largest cluster elicited in children when solving number tasks is in the right parietal cortex (since figurative schemes for number tasks are easier). In contrast, calculation tasks elicit activity mainly in the left parietal cortex (calculation involves harder \u2212 relational \u2212 figurative schemes to be coordinated using the child\u2019s mental attentional capacity). Similarly, activity for the simple number tasks is observed in the right hemisphere, whereas calculation tasks implicate the left frontal cortex more extensively. It would be interesting for future studies to examine brain correlates of incorrect trials, to identify whether right hemisphere is a main contributor to attempts to solve trials that are too difficult for the children to solve.   \nModel of Right-Left-Right hemispheric dominance. \n  Table 4     \n\n\n#### Motivation and self-control \n  \nMotivation is the process whereby   affective   tendencies are expressed in conscious or unconscious affective goals (motives); which are then converted into conscious or unconscious cognitive goals ( ,  ,  ).   Affective goals   are dispositions to pursue desirable vital\/life outcomes or consequences, whereas   cognitive goals   are explicit intentions to do what is believed congruent with one\u2019s affective goals. Motivation crosses borders between affective and cognitive goals, and is critical for successfully doing difficult mental tasks. We propose that these affectively-driven   endogenous   cognitive goals rely critically on the insular cortex. \n\nThe insula is a structure that connects temporal and frontal lobes deep within the lateral (Sylvian) sulcus; it is active in many diverse task situations, including cognition, interoception, perception and emotion ( ,  , for meta analyses). It is also implicated in cognitive processes such as inhibitory control ( ), and speech and language processing ( ). In a study examining math anxiety, data showed that anticipating an upcoming math-task elicited increased activity in the posterior insular cortex ( ). Together with sub-cortical structures like the basal ganglia, the insula is involved in learning and training tasks ( ,  ,  ). It has been shown to participate in the affective \u2212 aversive \u2212 feeling of difficult effort ( ,  ,  ). The insula integrates interoceptive affect feedback and is related to the orbitofrontal cortex \u2212 involved in exteroceptive feedback ( ). Regarding interoceptive feedback, Damasio writes: \u201c\u2026 relative to the visceral and internal milieu, the insula is the equivalent of the primary visual or auditory cortices\u201d ( ). The insula is proposed to have a generic role in problem solving ( ), and mathematics may serve as a domain for targeted testing of the understanding of interceptive feeling of effort when comparing children and adults. \n\nSelf-control is related to motivation, in the sense that a motivated action requires self-control to be carried out, particularly in complex situations. When task problem-solving appears complicated and misleading, self-consciousness may become particularly necessary (e.g.,  ,  ). The operative aspect of this self (i.e., the functional organization that William James would call I-self) is possibly in medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex; this is the operative aspect of self-control found in the   medial frontal cortex   ( ,  ,  ). The figurative\/representational self-processes (the me-self of William James) would be located (see  ), in the   posteromedial cortex  , i.e., the combination of posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and precuneus. \n\nThe active coordination between motivation and self-control would elicit activation in the anterior cingulate and insular cortices. Both anterior cingulate and insular cortices are prevalent clusters in children\u2019s mathematical problem-solving. In adults, the cingulate and insula cortices activate bilaterally in number and calculation tasks (Table S2). Importantly, these activations in adults are listed further down in the ALE-obtained coordinate list (Table S2 cluster 3 and 4 for number tasks and cluster 5 and 7 for calculation tasks), possibly because adults\u2019 prior practice has already transformed into cognitive goals and cognitive circuits\/networks the original affective goals (motives)   and   interoceptive feelings of effort, within the math domain. In contrast, the cingulate gyrus and the insula occupy in children respectively the first and second larger clusters of activity for calculation tasks; moreover the insula has the highest likelihood of being detected during calculations in children. In our view this finding is important, suggesting that intrinsic (interoceptive) motivation and self-control in children are critical to perform difficult calculations \u2212 but much less so during number tasks, which are more automatized. \n\n\n\n### Limitations and considerations for future studies \n  \nThe current meta-analyses focus on functional correlates of brain regions in children relating to number and calculation tasks. We report data representing concordance across these types of task. There are limitations associated with the meta-analysis method, and with choices we had to make, due to the methodology in the original studies. Shortcomings of the ALE method have been previously discussed (e.g.,  ,  ). However, ALE meta-analysis remains superior to traditional review approaches, because it permits investigating over-arching patterns of activity across studies. An advantage is the automated computational steps that permit quantification of locations of common activation across studies. In terms of article selection, we chose a conservative approach; we eliminated many articles that appeared to use same participants (see method section), and articles that used children in large age ranges. Eliminating these studies may have lowered strength of concordance detected, but the conclusions drawn from such conservative approach are likely to be more representative of brain responses in school age children, which was our main concern. Further, because of a lack of studies, we have not specifically examined brain responses to mathematical operations separately (i.e., only addition, only multiplication). Methodological choices in some studies lacked developmental theoretical grounding; for instance, since we know from behavioural research that performance on mathematical abilities improves with age, studies should specify a theoretical reason for averaging data over large age ranges. Similar behavioural performance on a task does not imply that the same set of brain regions support the particular performance across age groups ( ). For future studies, in addition to demographics such as gender and age range of participants (missing in some articles), it is critical to report within-group contrast coordinates for healthy children \u2212 even when this is not the main focus of the paper. Such practices would be beneficial for future meta-analyses on the topic. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese meta-analyses investigate brain activity in children that underlies processing of number and calculation tasks. These are the first meta-analyses in children younger than 14 years distinguishing between number and calculation tasks. Based on these results we sketched a neuropsychological developmental model of mathematical cognition in stereotaxic-space. We find that mathematical performance in children emerges from known core-regions associated with number processing, such as parietal and frontal areas; but it also emerges from regions not previously recognized in a mental-arithmetic network, such as the insula, the claustrum, and the cingulate gyrus. The insula, in particular, may play a critical role in children\u2019s mathematical calculation, because children need strong intrinsic motivation and affective goals to cause their effort in attention and complex processing. Future behavioural and neuroimaging work on children\u2019s mathematical cognition should benefit from a refined topographical atlas of mathematical processes in healthy children. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nNone. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6969084,"text_md5":"ba55c09262c9970f50069d52665d1694","field_positions":{"authors":[0,85],"journal":[86,103],"publication_year":[105,109],"title":[120,215],"keywords":[229,299],"abstract":[312,1665],"body":[1674,41532]},"batch":1,"pmid":28844728,"doi":"10.1016\/j.dcn.2017.08.002","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6969084","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6969084"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6969084\">6969084<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6969084  Brain areas associated with numbers and calculations in children: Meta-analyses of fMRI studies"}
{"text":"Tench, Christopher R. and Tanasescu, Radu and Auer, Dorothee P. and Cottam, William J. and Constantinescu, Cris S.\nPLoS One, 2014\n\n# Title\n\nCoordinate Based Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data Using Activation Likelihood Estimation; Full Width Half Max and Group Comparisons\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nCoordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) is used to find regions of consistent activation across fMRI and PET studies selected for their functional relevance to a hypothesis. Results are clusters of foci where multiple studies report in the same spatial region, indicating functional relevance. Contrast meta-analysis finds regions where there are consistent differences in activation pattern between two groups. The activation likelihood estimate methods tackle these problems, but require a specification of uncertainty in foci location: the full width half max (FWHM). Results are sensitive to FWHM. Furthermore, contrast meta-analysis requires correction for multiple statistical tests. Consequently it is sensitive only to very significant localised differences that produce very small p-values, which remain significant after correction; subtle diffuse differences between the groups can be overlooked. In this report we redefine the FWHM parameter, by analogy with a density clustering algorithm, and provide a method to estimate it. The FWHM is modified to account for the number of studies in the analysis, and represents a substantial change to the CBMA philosophy that can be applied to the current algorithms. Consequently we observe more reliable detection of clusters when there are few studies in the CBMA, and a decreasing false positive rate with larger study numbers. By contrast the standard definition (FWHM independent of the number of studies) is demonstrated to paradoxically increase the false positive rate as the number of studies increases, while reducing ability to detect true clusters for small numbers of studies. We also provide an algorithm for contrast meta-analysis, which includes a correction for multiple correlated tests that controls for the proportion of false clusters expected under the null hypothesis. Furthermore, we detail an omnibus test of difference between groups that is more sensitive than contrast meta-analysis when differences are diffuse. This test is useful where contrast meta-analysis is unrevealing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA very popular method of performing a meta-analysis (MA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data is coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA). There are various approaches  \u2013 , but the common aim is to locate regions where different studies agree on the location of activation peaks (foci) better than expected by chance alone. Results are then thought to be of significance to the common functional aspect(s) of the studies included in the analysis. A further aim is to compare different groups, for example healthy control and patient groups, using contrast meta-analysis. \n\nHere we focus on the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) based method, which is possibly the most widely known of the CBMA schemes. The ALE method models the uncertainty of the reported foci using a Gaussian function with specified full width half max (FWHM)  . It then estimates the likelihood, at each voxel, that there is consistent activation across multiple studies. Clusters of voxels with significantly high ALE are tested for by a permutation test. The ALE method is very popular, and has been, and is being, used to generate many publications. Despite this, there remain major problems. \n\nThe FWHM parameter, which is often set at \u224810 mm, has a major effect on the results  . In the similar kernel density analysis (KDA) method of CBMA, a FWHM of 10 mm or 15 mm is reported to produce the best results  . The signed differential mapping (SDM) uses 25 mm  . For the ALE methods, in an attempt to quantify the FWHM it has recently been estimated by fMRI experiment and a dependency on the number of subjects suggested  . Nevertheless, the lack of consensus on this parameter is one of the issues for CBMA. Indeed some CBMA methods remove the FWHM as a fixed parameter  ,  . However, these methods are sensitive to the required prior knowledge elicited from experts, and in the case of the method of Yue et. al. has not been generalised, in a computationally practical sense, to three dimensions. \n\nHere a new FWHM scheme is introduced. This is motivated by the reasonable requirement that CBMA of a small set of studies should ideally produce results commensurate with those produced if the number of studies were increased. It redefines the FWHM as a density clustering parameter, rather than a specification of the uncertainty of the reported foci used by current ALE algorithms. \n\nThe correction for many correlated statistical tests is a problem for contrast meta-analysis that has not yet been addressed  ; indeed contrast meta-analysis has previously been performed without any correction  , which will inevitably lead to false positive results. Several methods are used to impose voxel-level (since testing is performed at each voxel) control of the rate of falsely rejected null hypotheses in CBMA; for example false discovery rate (FDR) control  ,  . The latest ALE algorithms have introduced cluster-level control to CBMA  , which is preferred to voxel-level control since it directly relates to the results, by limiting cluster sizes to be larger than expected under the null hypothesis. CBMA is performed many   times using foci randomised throughout a brain mask and a user specified voxel-level threshold (for example   uncorrected). The distribution of the size of the resulting clusters is recorded, and a user specified quantile of this distribution (for example 95%) subsequently used as a lower permissible cluster size in the CBMA of the original foci. However, this scheme requires two independent user specified thresholds, so it is not clear exactly what this means for the proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses. Furthermore, while this cluster-level control may be appropriate for CBMA where the null hypothesis is closely related to that obtained using random foci, it is not appropriate for contrast meta-analysis where the null hypothesis is obtained by permutation of the grouping variable. \n\nWe previously detailed a CBMA method that employed a false cluster discovery rate (FCDR) control scheme that has the particularly interpretable aim of limiting the proportion of the significant clusters expected under the null hypothesis. The control problem is further tackled by substantially reducing the number of statistical tests by testing only at the reported foci (  tests), rather than at each voxel (  tests). We showed that this leads to fewer false positive results than using FDR correction at the voxel level, or using cluster-level control via minimum cluster size thresholding, yet maintains sensitivity  . Here we extend FCDR to contrast meta-analysis. The proposed method requires specification of only one threshold, is interpretable, and does not assume independence of the many tests. \n\nThe contrast meta-analysis method can localise significant focal differences between groups, indicating brain structures where functional activation differs. However, due to the need to correct for multiple comparisons, this method lacks sensitivity for detecting more diffuse subtle differences between the groups; such differences do not produce the very small p-values required to survive the correction. Lack of significant results from contrast meta-analysis is not, therefore, a good indicator that the two groups do not differ in activation pattern. Here we introduce an omnibus test of difference between groups. Only one test is performed, so no correction is necessary; this is similar to Fisher's combined probability test  , but without the assumption for independence of the probabilities. Consequently it is better able to detect diffuse differences than contrast meta-analysis. The test can provide evidence for difference between groups when the contrast meta-analysis is unrevealing. \n\nIn summary, this report describes new tools for ALE based experiments. Specifically: 1) a new definition and method for setting the FWHM parameter, 2) a description of the contrast meta-analysis algorithm and subsequent correction for multiple correlated comparisons at the cluster-level, and 3) an omnibus test of difference between groups. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nStatistical significance in the ALE method is judged relative to a null distribution of ALEs, generated by permutation of the foci throughout a grey matter (GM) mask  ,  . When many studies report activations in similar locations, the foci density is high so there is little distance between them. In regions reported as active by few studies, the foci are lower in density. \n\nWhile our algorithm (LocalALE) has been detailed previously  , some specifics are important to the methods presented in this report. The ALE method models the spatial distribution ( ) of the   reported foci in the   study ( ) by a Gaussian distribution of specified standard deviation ( ) or FWHM. The Gaussians are truncated at  , or equivalently  , \n\nwhere \n\nand is zero otherwise. The truncation removes 5% of the \u2018mass\u2019 of the Gaussian, and is performed to reduce the influence of foci over long distance, and to make testing only at the foci possible  . It has previously been shown that with 5% truncation, the resulting clusters are similar to those obtained using the \u2018full\u2019 Gaussian  ; clearly some truncation is always present even with the \u2018full\u2019 Gaussian, imposed by the brain volume. The spatial activation distribution for study   is \n\nfrom which the ALE is computed. \n\nFoci separated by a distance   overlap (are separated by less than the truncation distance). Overlapping foci across studies form clusters, which, if significant, are the results of the CBMA. \n\nThe software is available to download and use freely from  . \n\n### The FWHM in ALE based CBMA \n  \nThe FWHM can affect the results of ALE based CBMA  . Often the FWHM is set to  , but there is some variance on this. An empirical FWHM has been described  , based on the idea that it measures the variance of activation peak position on repeating the same experiment in a group of volunteers. This suggests that the FWHM should depend on the number of subjects within a study; the larger the number, the smaller the uncertainty in the location of the peak of the activation, and so the smaller the FWHM. While this is intuitively reasonable, it does create some issues. Firstly, the suggested estimate is based on a specific functional experiment, and might not be generalizable. Secondly, ideally the results from a small CBMA study should agree with a larger CBMA performed if more studies were available. In this report a new definition and estimate for FWHM that depends on the number of studies in the CBMA is presented. \n\nEach study in the CBMA reports foci of activation, some of which are common to a proportion of the studies, while others are due to some study specific aspect. Where there is better than chance agreement across studies about the activation peaks, the foci form clusters of higher than average density. Between the clusters, the study specific foci form a lower than average density noise. Identifying clusters of high density points in the presence of noise can be tackled using the density-based spatial clustering in applications with noise (DBSCAN)   algorithm. Clusters in DBSCAN are formed by points that are density reachable, such that any point in the cluster can be connected to any other within the cluster via a chain of points that are separated by a distance less than parameter \u2018Eps\u2019. The problem is depicted in  ;   shows a sparse set of points and   a larger set of points. If Eps is set too large, the clusters begin to merge, and the noise points are recruited to the clusters. If Eps is set too small, the clusters are missed. In   Eps is represented by the radius of the dotted circles. For the algorithm to succeed the Eps parameter must be set such that within-cluster the points fall within a distance Eps of other points in the cluster, while the noise must be beyond this distance. Consequently, for the sparse set of points ( ), Eps is larger than for the larger set of points ( ). \n   Depicts how the Eps parameter in the density clustering algorithm DBSCAN is modified as the size of the data set is changed.  \nFor sparse data sets (a) the Eps parameter is large (represented by the radius of the circles in (c)). For the larger data set, Eps is smaller. Eps is chosen so that the dense cluster of points and the noise are separate. This clustering algorithm is analogous to CBMA, and the Eps parameter analogous to the FWHM. \n  \nSince the density clustering problem is analogous to CBMA, it is proposed that the FWHM parameter be redefined to be analogous to the Eps parameter in density clustering. The aim is to increase the FWHM for small numbers of studies such that the within-cluster foci can overlap, and reduce the FWHM for larger numbers of studies to prevent the study specific foci joining the clusters. To achieve this it is proposed that the characteristic volume occupied by each foci   is inversely proportional to the number of studies such that \n\nwhere   N   is the total number of studies, and   is a constant to be estimated. The proposed estimate of FWHM is now   to signify its relationship to both the FWHM conventionally used in CBMA and the clustering parameter used by DBSCAN. The parameter   can be estimated under the null hypothesis (randomised foci) where the average density of the foci across studies is higher than the study specific foci, and lower than the clustered foci. It is hypothesised that this scheme will: 1) help to prevent incidental recruitment of study specific foci to the clusters, and 2) help with the detection of low density clusters when there is little data. \n\nThis constitutes a redefinition of the FWHM parameter. It no longer represents spatial uncertainty in the location of the foci, but rather it is a density parameter similar to Eps, used in the DBSCAN   algorithm. \n\n#### FWHM Experiments \n  \nThe effect of varying the FWHM between 6 mm and 18 mm is visually assessed, using LocalALE, in three sets of fMRI data: 1) the pain data (47 experiments) used in  , 2) n-back data (61 experiments) used in   and downloaded using Sleuth (downloadable from  ) from the BrainMap database  , and 3) Stroop test data used in   and again downloaded using Sleuth; workspace files for downloading the data via Sleuth are available from the BrainMap website. It is expected that if the FWHM is too small, the clusters will be small, or even vanish. It is also expected that if the FWHM is too large, the clusters will merge and expand in spatial extent by including more nearby foci. In the case of the Stroop experiment, the data are separated into two groups: pooled studies requiring either a verbal response or a mechanical response (19 studies), and those specifically requiring mechanical response (6 studies). From the original meta-analysis it is expected that there is some similarity between these, and certainly this is expected on the grounds that one is a subset of the other. The difference in numbers of experiments in the two groups is used to demonstrate how FWHM must be modified to make the results commensurate. \n\nThe mean effect of FWHM on the clustering under the null hypothesis is also investigated; under the null hypothesis it is expected that large clusters do not form on average. Foci are randomised throughout a grey matter mask, as detailed in  , 10 times. For each randomisation the number of clusters (sets of foci in different studies separated by a distance smaller than  ) is counted. The mean number of clusters, as a proportion of the total number of foci, is plotted against FWHM to see when the clusters begin to form. It is expected that for very small FWHM the foci in different studies do not overlap under the null hypothesis, so the number of clusters will be equal to the number of foci; each non-overlapping focus being considered a cluster of one focus. As the FWHM is increased, foci will start to overlap and form larger clusters. An empirical estimate for parameter   ( )) is obtained by identifying the point where clusters just begin to form under the null hypothesis. \n\nTwo large data sets used previously   to examine the functional connectivity of two structures, the right amygdala (RA; 189 studies) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; 142 studies), are explored. The data sets are available for download from  , and were originally created by searching the BrainMap database   for any studies that report at least one activation within a seed region of interest (ROI); the ROIs are depicted in  . These datasets are of interest since it is obvious that there are significant clusters where the seed ROIs are defined, and that those clusters should be similar in size to the seed ROIs because they determine where the foci are located. Coordinate based meta-analysis is performed on the full datasets, and also on smaller subsets of 25 (25 is arbitrary, but not an unusual size for a typical CBMA experiment) randomly selected studies from each full dataset. The proposed  , and the FWHM specified in   and incorporated into GingerALE (a popular and freely available program used for ALE analysis; available from  ) are compared; GingerALE is used to demonstrate that the sensitivity to FWHM is not specific to our LocalALE method. It is expected that the clusters in the RA and OFC should be similar in the small and full datasets. \n\nFinally a numerically generated pseudo experiment is created. Each pseudo study in the experiment has 10 foci (around 10 foci would not be unusual in a real study), which are placed either within one of three clusters, or at random with uniform probability within the GM mask but outside of the clusters. The experiment is performed twice: a) with the proportion of studies reporting in the three clusters being 40%, 50%, and 60%, to reflect the proportion ranges observed in most significant clusters from the pain, Stroop, and n-back experiments, and b) with the proportion of studies reporting in the three clusters being 20%, 30%, and 40%, to consider the impact of less consistent activations. Foci that are truly members of the   cluster are placed at location  , where d are randomly generated from a truncated (at   standard deviations from the mean) Gaussian distribution with mean zero and FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm. The results of CBMA on these experiments are depicted for: 1)   using   ( )) estimated from the pain, n-back, and Stroop experiments, 2) FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm, and 3) using the FWHM estimate detailed by   and employed in GingerALE. \n\nTrue and false positive rates are explored quantitatively for this numerical experiment as a function of the number of studies (10 to 150 studies); 100 averages are performed for each number of studies. The true positive rates are the proportion of true cluster foci that are declared as cluster members, while the false positive rates are the non-cluster foci declared as members of a cluster. Both true and false rates are expressed as a proportion of the total number of true cluster foci to make them easy to compare. If the clustering analogy is valid for our CBMA experiment, it is expected that with FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm there will be fewer true positive results for few studies compared to  . Furthermore, it is expected that for large numbers of studies that the false positive rate will be higher for FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm than for  . \n\n\n\n### Contrast meta-analysis \n  \nContrast meta-analysis attempts to find differences in activation pattern between two groups of studies. The results are clusters of foci where there is localised significant difference in ALE between the groups. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the groups, so a permutation (of the group variable) test is employed. Following on from our LocalALE algorithm, tests for differences are performed only at the foci in the method reported here; instead of at each voxel. It also employs the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR) control of false positive results, as detailed previously in  . FCDR is particularly interpretable since it controls for the proportion of significant clusters expected under the null hypothesis. It also takes account of the correlated nature of the tests; the ALE values, and p-values, for each focus depends on the other foci and are therefore not independent. Contrast meta-analysis is useful when there are very significant localised differences between the groups that can survive the FCDR control. \n\nStudies are separated into two groups,   A   &   B  , containing   and   studies, respectively. Of all the permutations, the   is specified by \n\nand \n\nwhere   are the study numbers, and   since order is not important. The ALE for group   A  , permutation   i  , at location   r   is \n\nand similar for group   B  . The difference in ALE between the two groups is \n\n\n\nFor a particular permutation,   k  , and for a particular focus  , the significance (p-value) of the difference in ALE between the groups is \n\nor \n\n is an indicator function that equals 1 if   E   is true, and zero otherwise. A small value of   indicates that the magnitude of the ALE difference for foci   is particularly large for the   permutation. The sums in these expressions are over the set ( ) of all possible permutations of the grouping. However, since   is typically very large, p-values are estimated using a random selection of   permutations. Here, as suggested previously  , statistical tests are performed only for foci that are found to be significant by CBMA. This reduces the number of tests, and so increases the power, at the expense of testing for differences between the complete groups. \n\nIt is hypothesised that the groups   and  , which might be patients and healthy controls for example, have localised differences in activation pattern. The p-values   measure the significance of that difference. Clusters of significant foci are found, and counted, using the clustering algorithm provided in the supplement ( ); the algorithm finds the most significant foci first then uses Dijkstra's algorithm   to locate all other foci in the cluster, repeating the process to locate all clusters. The number of significant clusters is  , which is computed using only the foci with  . To control the FCDR, an estimate of the number of clusters expected under the null hypothesis is needed. This is estimated using a randomly selected set of 2000 permutations  , computing the number of clusters for each of these permutations   and averaging; 2000 is considered sufficient as repeating the experiments gives similar estimates of FCDR. Controlling the FCDR at a level of 0.05 (for example) is then performed by maximising   such that \n\nthe proportion of clusters expected under the null hypothesis is, at most, 0.05 with this  . Further detail about the calculation of FCDR is given in  . \n\n#### An omnibus test for difference between groups \n  \nContrast meta-analysis looks for differences in activation patterns, between groups, by location. But such analysis requires very significant differences; since the p-values need to be very small to remain significant after controlling for many statistical tests. An omnibus test can provide evidence of pattern differences when contrast meta-analysis produces no significant results. Such a test may be useful for detecting differences that are subtle, but spread across substantial regions of the activation pattern. \n\nA log likelihood value can be computed using the p-values from  ) and (10), \n\nwhere the sum is over all foci in permutation   k  . The magnitude of this will be small under the null hypothesis and larger when the data are critical of the null hypothesis. The distribution of   is not known because the p-values are not independent (for independent p-values, Fisher's combined probability test can be used), but can be estimated using a random selection of permutations  . Only 1000 permutations are used, and found to be sufficient, to estimate the single p-value for the omnibus test \n\n\n\nThis test is performed including all foci in the experiment. \n\n\n#### Experiments for contrast analysis \n  \nTo explore the two different scenarios considered above (highly significant local differences between groups, and more subtle wide spread differences) numerical experiments have been devised. \n\nThe first experiment involves two groups of studies with a cluster reported at {34, 10, 16}mm (Talairach coordinates) in group   A   and {\u221234, 10, 16}mm in group   B  . A further eight clusters are reported similarly by both groups. All foci that form part of a cluster have a random spatial perturbation as described for the FWHM numerical experiment. From the pain and n-back experiments, about 50% of studies report at the site of the most significant clusters. Therefore, each of the clusters in this experiment contains foci from half of the studies, and half of the foci in each study are distributed randomly, and with uniform probability, throughout the GM mask. \n\nThe two clusters at   should be highly significant with sufficient studies in the experiment. The clusters that are reported similarly by both groups should not produce significant differences. Results are reported in a table indicating number of clusters reported by both groups, number of studies per group, and significances by contrast meta-analysis and the omnibus test. \n\nThe second experiment involves up-to sixteen clusters reported by both groups. In group   A   the clusters involve foci (with the random perturbation used in the first experiment) from 50% of the studies, and half of the foci in each study will be randomly distributed, with uniform probability, throughout the GM mask. Group   B   is similar, but the proportion of studies reporting at each cluster is lower. The differences between the studies are then subtle, and spread across the activation pattern. Results are reported in a table indicating number of studies, proportion of studies reporting at clusters, and significances by contrast meta-analysis and the omnibus test. \n\nThe contrast meta-analysis and omnibus tests are performed using  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### FWHM experiments \n  \n#### Assessment of the effect of the FWHM parameter on real data \n  \n shows the result of CBMA of 47 pain studies performed on healthy subjects. Result are shown for two different slices (top and bottom rows) using FWHM ranging from 6 mm to 14 mm. For very small FWHM the clusters (outlined in green) become fragmented and small. At larger FWHM the clusters begin to merge and grow. \n   CBMA results for the 47 studies included in the pain CBMA for a range of FWHM produced using LocalALE.  \nWith small FWHM, the clusters shrink, or vanish. With large FWHM, the clusters merge and expand. \n  \n shows the CBMA results for the 61 n-back studies. Two different slices are shown (top and bottom rows) using FWHM ranging from 6 mm to 14 mm. As expected, for very small FWHM the clusters become fragmented and small. At larger FWHM the clusters begin to merge and grow. \n   CBMA results for the 61 studies included in the n-back CBMA for a range of FWHM produced using LocalALE.  \nWith small FWHM, the clusters shrink, or vanish. With large FWHM, the clusters merge and expand. \n  \n shows the CBMA results for the 6 manual (top row) response and 19 pooled (bottom row) Stroop studies. The results are similar, but at different FWHM. Below 18 mm in the manual Stroop experiment, the clusters vanish or shrink. Above 12 mm in the pooled stroop experiment the clusters just increase in size. \n   CBMA results for the Stroop experiment, for a range of FWHM produced using LocalALE.  \nTop row shows the Stroop studies where manual response was required (6 studies). Bottom row shows the pooled Stroop studies (19 studies). The studies give similar activation patterns, but only if the FWHM is modified to account for the number of studies per experiment. \n  \n\n#### Estimating the parameter  \n  \n depicts the number of clusters, under the null hypothesis (foci randomised), for each experiment as a function of FWHM. Also indicated are the FWHM where clustering just begins (number of clusters\u200a=\u200a0.5) under the null hypothesis for the pain, n-back, and Stroop experiments. Higher FWHM generates larger clusters, which is not expected under the null hypothesis. \n   Depiction of cluster forming under the null hypothesis (randomised foci) as a function of FWHM.  \nFor small FWHM, the foci do not overlap, so there are as many clusters as foci (single focus clusters). As the FWHM increases, larger clusters begin to form. \n  \nAn estimate of   can be obtained from  . If the   is the parameter value that just starts to form clusters under the null hypothesis, such that the foci overlap on average with one other, then the intercept of the curves with 0.5 on the   y   axis gives FWHM estimates of around 7 mm, 8 mm, 12 mm, and 18 mm for these experiments. Given the number of studies in the experiments, and using  ), yields an estimate for   of about 30 mm. The   estimates are then 8.3 mm, 7.6 mm, 11.2 mm, and 16.5 mm for the pain, n-back, pooled Stroop, and manual Stroop studies respectively. \n\n shows the results from CBMA of the RA and OFC experiments. Using   (top row), with  , produces clusters that are quite independent of the number of studies. Furthermore, the clusters are of a reasonable size given the seed ROIs presented in  . When the FWHM is determined as detailed in   (middle row), the clusters are quite large for the complete data sets, particularly considering the seed ROIs. The cluster sizes are also quite dependent on the number of studies. The number of clusters expected under the null hypothesis, as a function of FWHM, is shown on the bottom row. Estimates of a obtained at the point where the foci just begin to cluster (intercepting the   y   axis at 0.5) are 29 mm, 29 mm, 29 mm, and 31 mm for these four experiments. \n   CBMA of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and right amygdala (RA) studies, and smaller sub-studies.  \nThe top row depicts the results using  , the middle row is the result from GingerALE, and the bottom row depicts the number of clusters, as a function of FWHM, counted under the null hypothesis. \n  \n\n#### Numerical simulation experiments \n  \n shows the CBMA results for the simulated experiments; only the experiment with 40%, 50% and 60% of studies reporting in the clusters is shown as the lower proportion experiment is visually similar. The number of studies per experiment clearly has an impact on the results when using fixed FWHM; middle (FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm) and bottom (FWHM as defined in   and produced using GingerALE) rows. When using   with   in  ) (top row) the results are not so dependent on the number of studies. Furthermore, the cluster size, using  , is the most consistent with the foci distribution function, shown as a blue overlay on the left-most image; with the other FWHM estimates the clusters are small with just 10 studies, but expand in size beyond the boundary of the distribution function for large number of studies. \n   CBMA results for various numbers of studies, and using three definitions of the FWHM: top row uses  , middle uses FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm, and bottom uses the method reported by  ; produced using GingerALE.  \nThe left-most image shows the distribution function of the foci as a blue overlay. \n  \n explores the true and false positive rates associated with the numerical experiment where the proportion of studies reporting at the clusters is in the range 40% to 60%; both rates expressed as a proportion of the true cluster members. True cluster rates were very high regardless of the FWHM estimate used, except for ten studies where the larger   estimate is able to detect a greater proportion of true cluster members. This, however, is associated with an increase in the false cluster rate, since the larger  will also capture some of the study specific foci, which is noticeable in  . More striking are the false cluster rate trends in this plot. For a FWHM of 10 mm, the false cluster rate is increasing with the number of experiments. This leads to the paradoxical observation that increasing the number of studies included in the meta-analysis can be detrimental to the results. Using   results in a reducing false cluster rate with increasing study numbers, which is sensible for a meta-analysis; a fit revealed that the false cluster rate was   for this experiment. \n   True and false cluster rates for   and for FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm.  \na) shows rates when the proportion of studies reporting in the clusters is 40%, 50%, and 60%. b) shows the rates when the proportion of studies reporting in the clusters is 20%, 30%, and 40%. \n  \n explores the true and false positive rates associated with the numerical experiment where the proportion of studies reporting at the clusters is in the range 20% to 40%. In this case the true cluster rate is reduced when there are few studies because the FWHM is not large enough to cause clustering. The impact of this is reduced in the proposed method, which has a larger FWHM for fewer than 30 studies, but at the expense of higher false cluster rates. For larger numbers of studies the true cluster rate reaches 100% for FWHM\u200a=\u200a10 mm, but is slightly lower (97%) for the proposed method due to its smaller FWHM. Once more the most striking trends are those of the false cluster rates. While using   reduces this as the number of studies increases (again the rate was  ), it is increased when the FWHM is fixed at 10 mm. \n\nThese results are not specific to LocalALE, as we have shown in  . Indeed the contribution list for each cluster provided by GingerALE confirmed that a very high proportion of studies were reported falsely. Adjustment of the FWHM to account for the number of studies is therefore suggested. \n\n\n#### Contrast analysis experiments \n  \n shows the clusters used for the first contrast meta-analysis experiment. The eight clusters reported by both groups are seen in the left and middle image, along with the group specific clusters; highlighted by green ROIs. The rightmost image shows the contrast image, indicating where the activation patterns differ. In both groups 50% of studies report in each cluster. \n   CBMA results of the first contrast meta-analysis experiment.  \nThe left and middle images show groups   A   &   B  , which have eight clusters in common, and two (one each) group specific clusters. The right image shows the difference between the groups found using contrast meta-analysis. This experiment tests the ability of contrast meta-analysis and the omnibus test to detect very significant differences between groups in the presence of an otherwise similar activation pattern. Note that while an intensity threshold (the lowest significant ALE value) is applied the leftmost and middle images, no such threshold is applied to the ALE difference image (right). \n  \n shows that the results of contrast meta-analysis are not significant (FCDR>0.05) for 10 or 14 studies per group, and just about significant with 16 studies per group. When contrast meta-analysis was significant, it managed to find both group specific clusters, as expected. The omnibus test is significant in all of the experiments, indicating greater sensitivity. This is because the omnibus test needs no correction for the multiple tests. It should be noted that the p-values and FCDR values reported in   are approximate; partly because they are estimated by permutation test, but mostly because the experiments include random foci, which would be different if the experiment were re-generated. Experiments were therefore repeated several times to check that the results presented were representative. \n   Results for the first group comparison experiment.        \n shows the 16 clusters used for the second contrast meta-analysis experiment. Both group   A   and group   B   report some, or all, of these clusters. In group   A   50% of studies report in each cluster, while a smaller percentage of studies in group   B   report at each cluster (see  ). \n   CBMA results of the second contrast meta-analysis experiment.  \nEach group reports the same number of clusters (up-to 16, as shown), but with different frequencies. This experiment tests the ability of contrast meta-analysis and the omnibus test to detect subtle differences spread across the activation pattern. \n     Results for the second group comparison experiment (see  ).        \n shows the results of contrast meta-analysis and the omnibus test when differences between groups are spread over the activation pattern. As the differences between the studies increase, either per cluster or as the number of clusters that are different increases, the tests become more sensitive as expected. However, contrast meta-analysis is not completely successful in finding all differences between the two groups, as indicated by the range of clusters found on repeating the experiment; with different random foci. The omnibus test is certainly more sensitive, able to detect differences between even small groups of studies. It should be noted that the smallest p-value reported for the omnibus test is 0.001; since only 1000 permutations are used to compute the p-value, 0.001 is the smallest non-zero value possible. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe have detailed three tools for use with coordinate based meta-analysis. By analogy with density clustering, we have redefined the FWHM parameter used in CBMA as a cluster density parameter, which depends on the cube root number of studies in the analysis, and is based on the idea that the results of CBMA should be commensurate when performed with different numbers of studies. We have also detailed an algorithm for comparing activation patterns between groups, contrast meta-analysis, using similar methods to our previously described LocalALE algorithm. Statistical testing is performed only at the foci, rather than at each voxel, and our FCDR method of false positive control is employed. Such contrast meta-analyses are only sensitive to very significant localised differences in activation, so we also detail an omnibus test of difference between groups. The omnibus test is sensitive even to subtle diffuse differences between activation patterns, and can provide evidence for a difference where contrast meta-analysis is unrevealing. \n\nBy visually inspecting the resulting clusters for several CBMAs, it becomes clear that the FWHM parameter has a major effect on the results. To preserve the cluster characteristics we proposed, by analogy with the density clustering algorithm DBSCAN, that the characteristic volume of each foci   should be adjusted for the number of studies included in the analysis. This method of specifying FWHM completely changes the original meaning that the FWHM represented the spatial uncertainty in the reported foci, for example due to registration error. \n\nUsing a typical (10 mm) FWHM, or the FWHM suggested by Eickhoff et. al.  , results in diminishing or vanishing clusters as the number of studies is reduced, and expanding and merging clusters as the number of studies is increased. This was demonstrated using numerically generated experiments, and by using small selections of studies from real CBMAs. It is clear from the experiments that using a FWHM that is independent of the number of studies could easily lead to the incorrect conclusion that groups with different numbers of studies have different activation patterns; consider the Stroop experiments ( ).   demonstrates that for increasing study numbers, the cluster sizes increase if the FWHM parameter is not adjusted. This is counter intuitive, as the cluster size and location should be convergent as the experiment size increases. Taking this to its limit of very large numbers of studies, clusters will merge, and study specific foci recruited to them, which is incorrect. \n\nOur proposed method of estimating the FWHM aims to allow overlapping of the high density foci that form clusters, but prevent overlapping of the low density study-specific foci between the clusters. We use an empirical estimate of FWHM based on that which just starts to cause overlapping of foci between different studies under the null hypothesis ( ). This is commensurate with the DBSCAN analogy, since at that FWHM the densely packed within-cluster foci overlap, while the between-cluster foci do not. This leads to an estimate of the parameter   in  ). \n\nThe experiments depicted in   are of particular interest because for these we know where the clusters are located, and their approximate size, since this was predefined as part of the experimental procedure  . Using   gives results that are reasonable given the original seed ROIs, independent of the number of studies included. Using the FWHM specified in  , on the other hand, produces rather large clusters for the full dataset. Using these experiments, another estimate of the parameter   is obtained  . \n\nWe have quantitatively analysed the true and false positive rates associated with FWHM estimates using numerical simulation (  and  ). Three clusters were defined and foci generated to be either true or false cluster members. The results are in keeping with the proposed idea that the FWHM must be adjusted for the number of studies. For very few studies FWHM needs to be increased to allow the foci to overlap and form clusters, albeit with an associated increase in the false cluster rate. Failing to do this could result in missed clusters, as shown by the Stroop experiment. On the other hand, the FWHM must be reduced as the number of studies increases to prevent recruitment of non-cluster foci into the clusters. Indeed the striking observation from   is that increasing the number of studies in the meta-analysis can be detrimental if the FWHM is fixed due to increased false positives. This is entirely contrary to the aim of meta-analysis, which attempts to reduce uncertainty in estimates. \n\nWe have estimated the parameter   in  ) to be  , using multiple independent observations; giving the typically used   FWHM for an experiment including 30 studies. However, there is some variance on this estimate, and some minor adjustment might be necessary if the clusters are visually fragmented or merging. \n\nControl of false positives in our contrast meta-analysis algorithm is achieved using FCDR; a cluster-level control scheme. Cluster-level schemes have been incorporated into CBMA algorithms previously, and are preferred since they control at the level of interest (clusters) rather than at the voxel-level, but not into algorithms performing contrast of the ALE; indeed no method of control, other than conservative p-value threshold, has previously been described  . \n\nThe contrast meta-analysis and omnibus test for differences between two groups were demonstrated using numerically generated experiments. The first experiment showed the ability of contrast meta-analysis to find local differences, if those differences were very significant. The omnibus test was also able to detect such differences, and with greater sensitivity, but without specifying where the differences are. A second experiment showed that when there are multiple subtle differences between groups, the omnibus test again had more power to detect it than contrast meta-analysis; as expected. Both methods are more sensitive with higher numbers of studies, more significant local differences, or more widespread subtle differences. \n\nLack of spatial difference in contrast meta-analysis experiments is not a good indicator that there is no difference between the groups being compared because the test is not sensitive to diffuse subtle differences. The omnibus test is more powerful, and should be used where the contrast meta-analysis produces no results. If the omnibus test is not significant, it is more likely that any real difference between groups is small. If it is significant, it can indicate widespread subtle differences between the groups that are undetectable by contrast meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe FWHM parameter used in ALE coordinate based meta-analysis algorithms is a source of heterogeneity between CBMA results. The meaning of the parameter has been redefined here from being the spatial uncertainty of the reported foci, to a parameter similar to that employed in a density clustering algorithm that works analogously to CBMA. This definition helps reduce the observed heterogeneity. More importantly, fixing the FWHM can paradoxically result in increased false positives as the number of studies increases, while the proposed   estimate can reduce the false positive rates in the meta-analysis with increasing study numbers. \n\nThe many tests used to compare the activation patterns between two groups necessitate a correction for multiple comparisons. We have detailed a contrast meta-analysis algorithm and correction for multiple tests that controls for the proportion of clusters expected under the null hypothesis, the false cluster discovery rate, and takes explicit account of the correlated tests. However, the contrast meta-analysis is not sensitive to diffuse differences between groups. We have therefore detailed an omnibus test that can provide evidence of differences in activation pattern between two groups even when contrast meta-analysis is unrevealing. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4165754,"text_md5":"c7aa21913975688b5e33b73f3e609839","field_positions":{"authors":[0,114],"journal":[115,123],"publication_year":[125,129],"title":[140,284],"keywords":[298,298],"abstract":[311,2373],"body":[2382,45754]},"batch":1,"pmid":25226581,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0106735","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4165754","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4165754"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4165754\">4165754<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4165754  Coordinate Based Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data Using Activation Likelihood Estimation; Full Width Half Max and Group Comparisons"}

R software was used to analyze the continuous variables, and Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) was used to perform an analysis of fMRI data.   Findings  . A total of 7 studies comprising 143 patients in the treatment group and 138 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment helps the healing process of motor dysfunction in stroke patients and exhibits hyperactivation in the bilateral basal ganglia and insula and hypoactivation in motor-related areas (especially bilateral BA6 and left BA4).  \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \n Acupuncture plays a role in promoting neuroplasticity in subcortical regions that are commonly affected by stroke and cortical motor areas that may compensate for motor deficits, which may provide a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nStroke is a syndrome characterized by an acute onset of neurologic deficit resulted from ischemia or hemorrhage. It became the leading cause of death and years of life lost (YLLs) at the national level in China [ ]. Patients with stroke are susceptible to several complications, including pain, dysphagia, pneumonias, incontinence, depression, and somatic dyskinesia, which usually impede clinical recovery and require specific intervention [ ,  ]. In this review, we mainly focus on the motor dysfunction after stroke. As a common and severe complication of stroke, motor dysfunction recovery requires multidisciplinary treatment and still remains a clinical challenge [ ]. Seeking an effective and safe alternative therapy meets the requirement of the Healthy China 2030 plan [ ]. \n\nAcupuncture, a key modality of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapy, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an alternative and complementary strategy for poststroke treatment [ ,  ]. Acupuncture has been widely used to relieve pain and improve motor or neurological function [ ,  ]. Sufficient previous studies including animal experiments, clinical trials, and systematic reviews have proven that acupuncture was beneficial for stroke rehabilitation [ ]. Although the application of acupuncture has shown good clinical efficacy, the mechanisms of acupuncture remain unknown. One hypothesis suggests that acupuncture may induce neuroplasticity to exert therapeutic effects [ \u2013 ]. \n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the capability of the nervous system to modify and reorganize the brain structure and function in response to impairment or experience; various behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies can document changes in the nervous system [ ,  ]. One of the recommended modalities used to measure neuroplasticity in humans is resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), which is often used to assess resting-state networks in participants [ ,  ]. The main analysis approaches of rs-fMRI are regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs). The former evaluates the temporal homogeneity of the regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and the latter reflects intrinsic brain low frequency [ ,  ]. Aimed at a better understanding of the cerebral characters of acupuncture treatment, more and more acupuncture studies have applied rs-fMRI in the clinical trials. However, no consensus has been reached, possibly due to the small sample size or distinctions of experimental design between studies. For example, Schaechter et al. [ ] have reported that acupuncture would activate the ipsilateral lesional motor cortex to improve motor function in patients with hemiparetic stroke, while others suggested that the basal ganglia would be predominantly activated by acupuncture [ ]. \n\nTherefore, in order to elucidate which brain area plays a crucial role in the therapeutic effect of acupuncture, this review synthesized corresponding studies and introduced coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) to quantitatively integrate the results of individual neuroimaging studies [ ,  ]. The feature of CBMA is the use of effect sizes, which allows combination of peak coordinates with statistical parametric maps and it has been fully validated in many studies [ \u2013 ]. In the present study, we applied the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI), which is a new generation algorithm for CBMA meta-analysis, to analyze the rs-fMRI data of included studies [ ,  ]. The results would determine whether acupuncture has a differential effect on brain activity as compared to regular or conventional treatment. The apprehension of neuroplasticity mechanisms induced by acupuncture can not only elucidate the central mechanism of acupuncture but also possibly provide novel ideas for applying acupuncture to the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nWe conducted the meta-analysis in line with the   Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions  . All procedure followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA guidelines). The study was registered in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number: CRD 42020185421). \n\n### 2.1. Literature Search \n  \nStudies that examined the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in stroke patients were included in the present study. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (VIP), and the Wanfang Database (WF) were searched from inception until May 2020 by two independent researchers. The following English search terms were used: (stroke OR Poststroke OR Cerebrovascular Accident OR Cerebrovascular Apoplexy OR Apoplexy OR Brain Vascular Accident OR Cerebrovasc\u2217 OR brain\u2217 OR brain vasc\u2217 OR hemipleg\u2217 OR apoplex\u2217 OR CVA OR TIA) AND (acupuncture OR acupuncture therapy OR acupuncture treatment OR electroacupuncture OR electro-acupuncture OR acupuncture, ear OR ear acupuncture OR auriculotherapy OR scalp acupuncture) AND (RCT OR randomized controlled trial OR controlled clinical trial OR randomized OR clinical trial OR randomly OR RCT OR trial) AND (fMRI OR functional MRI OR functional magnetic resonance imaging OR neuroimaging). The languages of the trials were restricted to English or Chinese, and the search strategy for each database was based on its own unique characteristics. \n\n\n### 2.2. Inclusion\/Exclusion Criteria \n  \nTwo researchers independently conducted the search and screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the papers. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) an RCT conducted in patients with stroke sequelae at any-stroke stage, of any age and gender; (2) manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture with or without other therapies in the treatment group, while other therapies including conventional rehabilitation or sham acupuncture in the control group; (3) involved whole-brain functional imaging (ReHo or ALFFs) in resting state; (4) three-dimensional coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) reported in standard stereotactic space Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI); (5) if one study involved two or more comparable datasets, all samples were included; and (6) used secondary outcomes to assess clinical efficacy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study only used region of interest (ROI) method; (2) the sample size in each group was less than 5; (3) if separate papers used the same or similar datasets, only the largest sample was included. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment \n  \nData were extracted from the included studies into a standard form with respect to publishing year, name of the first author, sample size, participants' condition, intervention design, fMRI method, and secondary outcome measures. Missing or unclear data for the meta-analysis were obtained after corresponding with the original authors by email or telephone. Two independent researchers carried out the data extraction; any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. This information is showed in  . Quality assessment was based on Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and carried out by two researchers independently. All the reports were evaluated according to the following seven criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at low, high, or unclear risk of bias. \n\n\n### 2.4. Data Synthesis and Meta-Analysis \n  \nReHo results: the differences of brain activity between the treatment group and the control group were analyzed by SDM-PSI (version 6.21,  ). A step-by-step tutorial is provided on this website. First, reported peak coordinates and effect sizes (  t   value, or equivalently from   z  -scores or   P   values) were extracted to prepare the peaks' text files. In the step of preprocessing, software will use those files to recreate the lower and upper bounds of the possible effect-size values of the studies. Second, the meta-analysis consisted in calculating the random-effects mean of the ReHo values and the mean map was weighted by the sample size and variance of each study. We reported results using family-wise error (FWE) correction (  P   < 0.05 and voxel extent \u2265 10) with the threshold-free cluster enhancement approach (TFCE) and 5000 permutations. The heterogeneity analyses were also assessed. The peak MNI coordinate would be extracted to derive standard heterogeneity statistics   I  , and an   I   < 50% indicates low heterogeneity. Funnel plots were not performed because the amount of included studies (  n   = 7) was less than 10, but the Egger test was used to assess the publication bias. Finally, a metaregression analysis was carried out to figure out the relationship between ReHo changes and clinical variables. All results would be reported using the TFCE-based FWE corrected threshold (  P   < 0.05 and voxel extent \u2265 10). \n\nClinical variables: statistical analyses of continuous data were performed with R software, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), using the Meta and Metafor meta-analysis packages. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CIs was used. Heterogeneity was tested by the   I   statistic. We selected fixed or random-effects model to pool the data depending on whether the trials had good homogeneity (  P   > 0.10,   I   < 50%) or not. A forest plot was adopted to show the hypothesis test results, and if necessary, a sensitivity analysis or subgroup analysis would be performed to find sources of heterogeneity. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Included Studies \n  \nThe database search yielded 1195 articles. 272 duplicates were removed, and 883 articles were excluded after screening titles and abstracted. Of the 40 potentially relevant reports, 6 articles [ \u2013 ] and 7 studies (Chen et al. [ ] conducted two trials at the same time) proved eligible after full-text screening ( ). \n\nTrials were published after 2000, and each study enrolled 10 to 100 patients (140 individuals in the treatment group and 138 in the control group). All studied recruited ischemic stroke patients. There were no significant differences in demographic baseline characteristics, including age, gender, disease status including symptom duration, or secondary outcome measures between the two groups. Three studies reported the patient limb dysfunction of the right side and the most lesions of brain regions had the left laterality (especially in the left basal ganglia) [ ,  ,  ]. All patients in both groups received conventional treatment and, on this basis, participants in the treatment group underwent two or four courses (weeks) of manual acupuncture therapy, one study combined with sham acupuncture as comparison [ ]. The manual acupuncture methods include lifting yang to dredging du meridian needling method (LYDDM) and Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method (XNKQ) and empirical acupoints. The LYDDM and XNKQ needling methods are based on long-term clinical experiments and were developed in by Professor Peilin Zhang and Xuemin Shi, respectively. And the application of empirical acupoints means that doctors manipulate the acupuncture based on their clinical experience. All studies reported rs-fMRI data by using ReHo variations to compare differences before and after treatment in patients from both groups. Clinical efficacy was examined by Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA;   n   = 7), nervous functional deficiency scale (NDS;   n   = 3), Barthel index (BI;   n   = 4), or modified Barthel index (MBI;   n   = 3). The details and features of the studies are shown in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Quality Assessment \n  \nThe quality assessment was based on Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Among 7 RCTs, all the studies reported the methods of random sequence generation but only three studies of two articles employed allocation concealment [ ,  ]. Only two studies reported the methods of patient blinding [ ,  ], while Zhou et al. [ ] admitted that it was at high risk. Methods of blinding of outcome assessment were only applied in two studies [ ,  ]. Evaluation of incomplete outcome data depended on whether the clear descriptions of baseline data were shown. According to this standard, all studies were at low risk. None of the studies have published study protocols before, so it was difficult to evaluate selective reporting. We tended to believe a study was at low risk only if it reported all the three secondary outcome measures (FMA, NDS, BI, or MBI). Thus, low risk of bias in the domain of selective reporting was given to four studies [ ,  \u2013 ]. In addition, we did not find any other sources of bias. Overall, these studies were not of high quality, mainly in terms of allocation concealment, patient blinding, and outcome blinding.   presents the quality assessment of these 7 included studies. \n\n\n### 3.3. Meta-Analysis of ReHo Changes \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Mean Analysis \n  \nPatients in the treatment group showed hyperactivation in the right basal ganglia (  P   < 0.05,   z   = 6.622) and left insula (  P   < 0.05,   z   = 5.232) after acupuncture therapy and the decreased activity of the left precentral gyrus (PG;   P   < 0.05,   z   = \u22124.477) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG;   P   < 0.05,   z   = \u20134.723). Patients in the control group showed hyperactivation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG;   P   < 0.05,   z   = 5.457) and left supplementary motor area (SMA;   P   < 0.05,   z   = 4.867) after conventional treatment and a decrease of activity in the left striatum (  P   < 0.05,   z   = \u20134.876) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG;   P   \u2264 0.05,   z   = \u20135.547). Peak coordinates and cluster breakdowns are shown in  . Differences in the brain regions between conventional treatment and acupuncture treatment have been visualized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.3.2. Heterogeneity Analysis and Publication Bias \n  \nIn the treatment group, the ganglia, insula, left PG, and right SFG showed low between-study heterogeneity of effect size differences in peak coordinates (  I   = 0.88%\u20137.40%) and low between-study heterogeneity for each significant peak in the control group (  I   = 0.09%\u20131.29%). The heterogeneity results are shown in  . The Egger tests were insignificant in the treatment group (  P   = 0.464) and the control group (  P   = 0.501). \n\n\n#### 3.3.3. Metaregression Analysis \n  \nMetaregression was used to search for potential correlation between FMA scores, mean age, and disease duration in the treatment group. The FMA scores are associated with the left insula (Table  ). The analysis of mean age shows significance in the brain regions of the left cerebellum (Table  ). The disease duration is associated with many regions, including the left cerebellum, arcuate network and right SMG, and SFG (Table  ). \n\n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-Analysis of Secondary Outcomes \n  \nCompared with conventional treatment, manual acupuncture therapy was associated with a decrease of NDS score (\u20134.40; 95% CI, 3.79 to 5.01;   I   = 0), indicating that acupuncture could mitigate the impairment of nervous function. The change in BI score was 3.47 (3.47; 95% CI, 0.99 to 5.95;   I   = 87%) and that in MBI score was 7.49 (7.49; 95% CI, 5.38 to 9.59;   I   = 0). The increase of BI or MBI suggested that patients had better daily living ability after acupuncture. A greater increase of FMA score (5.73; 95% CI, 4.35 to 7.11;   I   = 77%) also demonstrated that acupuncture could improve motor function of the upper and lower limb. The forest plots are shown in Figures  \u2013 . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \n### 4.1. Main Findings \n  \nIt is suggested that acupuncture therapy could relieve neurological deficiency (NDS) and improve motor function (FMA) and daily living ability (MBI). These findings are discussed in many previous meta-analysis studies, so we will not discuss further here [ ,  ,  ]. In this paper, we mainly focus on the meta-analysis of ReHo changes. In the treatment group, stroke patients showed hyperactivation in the bilateral basal ganglia and insula. In the control group, patients showed that brain activities were increased in the bilateral frontal gyrus (BA6). However, the decreased activity of the bilateral frontal gyrus (BA6) and left precentral gyrus (BA4) was found in the treatment group. Additionally, the ReHo index of the left insula significantly correlated with FMA scores across all stroke patients after acupuncture therapy. \n\n\n### 4.2. The Involvement of the Basal Ganglia and Insula in Neuroplasticity Induced by Acupuncture \n  \nThe results showed that resting-state spontaneous brain activity was obviously increased in the bilateral basal ganglia and insula after acupuncture treatment. Hyperactivation in the basal ganglia comprised mostly the striatum. The basal ganglia play an important integrative role in motor regulation [ ]. It is implicated in human dystonia and motor control [ ]. Wang et al. have compared ischemic stroke patients to healthy participants, and they found that stroke patients showed low ReHo values in the basal ganglia, which is consistent with previous conclusions that the basal ganglia are vulnerable to ischemia [ ,  ]. Regarding motor function, the extent of damage to the basal ganglia seems to be a neural correlate for motor deficit. Three studies included in this review reported that the lesion locations were primarily in the basal ganglia [ ,  ,  ], which is in line with the theory that a common ischemic stroke in deep brain regions featured by high disability rate is basal ganglia lacunar stroke [ ]. Thus, it can be speculated that limb motor dysfunction of included ischemic stroke patients was mainly related to basal ganglia impairment. The results revealed that acupuncture therapy was also associated with hyperactivation in the insula. The insula integrates different functional systems including sensory motor and cognition and plays a part in motor programing and control [ ,  ]. Existing evidence suggests that the anterior insula is commonly affected by acute middle cerebral artery stroke [ ]. It seems that the damage of the insula is responsible for the motor dysfunction in stroke patients and acupuncture can activate it to exert therapeutic effect. The metaregression analysis also found that the ReHo increases of the insula are positively correlated to the increase in FMA scores, suggesting that acupuncture could improve ability of daily life via the activation of the insula. Here, our results show an increased spontaneous activity in the basal ganglia and insula after acupuncture treatment, indicating that acupuncture could remodel neuronal function of these areas. \n\n\n### 4.3. The Involvement of Motor-Related Areas in Neuroplasticity Induced by Acupuncture \n  \nIn both the treatment and control groups, our results showed significant alterations of brain activation in most parts of motor-related areas, including the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (especially BA6) and left precentral gyrus (especially BA4). BA4 and BA6 are traditional motor areas, consisting of the \u201cclassical\u201d motor network. BA4 is the location of the primary motor cortex (M1), responsible for planning and controlling voluntary motor movement on the body's contralateral side. BA6 includes the premotor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), where neurons have projections to M1 as well as the corticospinal tract (CST) [ ]. It bridges prefrontal and primary motor cortices and is engaged in planning of complex and coordinated movements [ ,  ]. Evidence from animal and clinical studies suggests that those areas associate with movement preparation and execution and the activation of these areas contributes to reorganization after stroke [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, the functional plasticity of BA6 and BA4 might explain the mechanism of motor recovery. \n\nIn this meta-analysis, the ReHo value of bilateral BA6 is significantly increased in the control group but decreased in the treatment group. Here, we speculate that the difference between two groups is in connection with the compensatory activity. Compensation at the neuronal level is characterized by activation in alternative brain areas not normally observed in nondisabled individuals [ ]. Previous animal studies have demonstrated that reorganization of residual motor cortex contributes to the restoration of movement dysfunction after stroke, which indicates that increased fMRI signal within a given brain area can not only reflect neural recovery but also compensation [ ,  ]. Thus, the increased activation of BA6 in the control group should be interpreted as being associated with compensation, which is in accordance with theories that the increased activity of BA6 is a form of compensation for motor deficit after stroke [ ]. A longitudinal fMRI study observed, in the early phase of poststroke recovery (less than 6 months), hyperactivation in bilateral SMA and PMC [ ]. Another study with similar results identified a positive correlation, involving increased signals in SMA, cingulate, and other motor areas of both hemispheres with good recovery process (from 2 to 7 weeks up to 6 months), suggesting that compensatory network may be the substrates of rehabilitation strategies [ ]. All the 7 studies in this review were similar in the duration of symptoms, ranging from 9-14 days up to 6 months, at which status the activation of BA6 would be increased according to the conclusions above. Interestingly, after receiving acupuncture treatment, the activation level of bilateral BA6 is induced to reduce. The decreased activity of BA6 may implicate the reduced dependence on its compensation, indicating the recovery of motor network, thus helping the ipsilateral limb to recover. Similarly, the results revealed that acupuncture therapy was also associated with hypoactivation in left BA4. Evidence from meta-analysis describes that an increased activation in contralesional M1 (BA4) is a highly consistent finding across different impairment levels and times poststroke [ ]. This is in accordance with theories that the increased activity of sound side hemisphere is a form of compensation for dysfunction of other damaged cerebral cortex [ ]. From this perspective, if most brain lesions of included patients had the right laterality, we would expect to see a weakened compensation of contralesional BA4 by acupuncture. Considering that 4 studies in this review did not report the locations of infarcted lesions, this assumption warrants further experiments and opens a way for investigation of the relationship between acupuncture treatment and compensatory activity of BA4. \n\n\n### 4.4. Strengths and Limitations \n  \nThis review is unique and innovative. To our knowledge, we are the first to have SDM-PSI analysis of rs-fMRI used in RCTs of acupuncture. Altered cerebral activity in ischemic stroke patients with motor dysfunction provides a new insight into brain mechanism and clinical application, and this review is intended to serve as both a challenge and an encouragement. Also, strict inclusion criteria were made to minimize selection bias, and 7 studies were synthesized in the final analysis. These trials generally consisted of similar target participants and study designs, thus making results comparable. \n\nAs an innovative study, this systematic review still has certain limitations. The main limitation of this review is the small sample size. Only 7 trials and 278 participants met the inclusion criteria so that publication bias and subgroup analysis of secondary outcomes measures were not performed. The results of quality assessments indicated that some studies were of low quality, especially in terms of blinding. The lack of high-quality RCTs made it hard to perform an accurate analysis of the interaction between acupuncture efficacy and neuroplasticity. Thus, to better figure out the potential influence of acupuncture on neuroplasticity after stroke, it is time to organize large-scale and elaborate-designed RCTs for further investigations. Moreover, it is supposed that different acupuncture parameters (referring to different acupoints, duration, frequency, and operation methods) may cause fine distinctions of altered cerebral activity. Therefore, there may exist heterogeneity in the acupuncture therapy protocol between included studies. Considering the particularity of acupuncture treatment, it is significant to synthesize the studies focusing on specific manipulation of acupuncture. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nThe meta-analyses of clinical outcome measures (FMA, NDS, BI, or MBI) show that acupuncture treatment is effective for motor function recovery in ischemic stroke patients. The ReHo meta-analysis reveals that acupuncture could induce extensive changes of cerebral activity, which suggests that the alterations of the basal ganglia, insula, and motor-related areas are involved in neuroplasticity of acupuncture. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanisms underlying effectiveness of acupuncture and also lead to the articulation of a more general hypothesis that acupuncture plays a role in facilitating neuroplasticity. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8192216,"text_md5":"907815e24de35d35b0ce048a8770da0b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,186],"journal":[187,199],"publication_year":[201,205],"title":[216,331],"keywords":[345,345],"abstract":[358,1893],"body":[1902,27295]},"batch":1,"pmid":34188677,"doi":"10.1155\/2021\/8841720","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8192216","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8192216"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8192216\">8192216<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8192216  Effect of Acupuncture on Neuroplasticity of Stroke Patients with Motor Dysfunction: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies"}

Considering this multi-level overlap, but also the distinct phenotypes of the disorders, we hypothesized both common and disorder-specific changes of large-scale brain systems, which mediate neural mechanisms and impaired behavioral traits, in MDD, ANX, and CP. To identify such common and disorder-specific brain changes, we conducted a transdiagnostic, multimodal meta-analysis of structural and functional MRI-studies investigating changes of gray matter volume (GMV) and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of large-scale intrinsic brain networks across MDD, ANX, and CP. The study was preregistered at PROSPERO (CRD42019119709). 320 studies comprising 10,931 patients and 11,135 healthy controls were included. Across disorders,   common   changes focused on GMV-decrease in insular and medial-prefrontal cortices, located mainly within the so-called default-mode and salience networks.   Disorder-specific   changes comprised hyperconnectivity between default-mode and frontoparietal networks and hypoconnectivity between limbic and salience networks in MDD; limbic network hyperconnectivity and GMV-decrease in insular and medial-temporal cortices in ANX; and hypoconnectivity between salience and default-mode networks and GMV-increase in medial temporal lobes in CP.   Common   changes suggested a neural correlate for comorbidity and possibly shared neuro-behavioral chronification mechanisms.   Disorder-specific   changes might underlie distinct phenotypes and possibly additional disorder-specific mechanisms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and chronic pain (CP) are frequent disorders of brain and behavior [ ]. They are closely related due to overlap of changes at different levels\u2014from genetic to brain and symptom level -, high degrees of comorbidity among them, and shared risk factors [ \u2013 ]. High comorbidity and overlapping risk factors, such as chronic and\/or acute life stress [ ], suggest overlapping neural correlates, i.e., similar changes in large-scale brain systems mediating between microscopic alterations and behavioral dysfunctions [ ]. Indeed, shared structural [ \u2013 ] and functional [ \u2013 ] changes in prefrontal-insular circuits, for example, have been reported in all three disorders. In addition, disorder-specific brain-changes have also been reported\u2014for instance, concerning dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in MDD [ ] and distinct amygdala nuclei in ANX [ ,  ]. These disorder-specific alterations might reflect specific phenotypes of these three related disorders. However, despite these hints at both common and specific brain changes across disorders, there is still no clear evidence whether and how changes in large-scale brain systems overlap and\/or differ consistently (i.e., across multiple studies) in MDD, ANX, and CP. It is important to know such commonalities and differences, as such findings could point to convergent and divergent underlying neuro-behavioral mechanisms, improving the understanding of common and\/or disorder-specific treatments (e.g., is there a neurobiological basis for the efficacy of antidepressants in also treating anxiety or pain?) and informing the development of future therapies. The current study addresses exactly this problem via transdiagnostic coordinate-based meta-analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-studies that compare healthy controls to patients with MDD, ANX, and CP, respectively. We selected a meta-analytic approach since especially for transdiagnostic comparisons, individual studies are often underpowered; meta-analyses can overcome this problem by synthesizing results across studies. Particularly, we investigated properties of intrinsic brain networks, namely intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), measured by correlated infra-slow blood oxygenation fluctuations of resting-state functional MRI-data [ ], and regional gray matter volume (GMV), measured by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of structural MRI-data [ ]. \n\nGiven this brief outline of our approach, we want to clarify two of its critical points, namely why we restricted our approach to MDD, ANX, and CP, and why we focused on intrinsic brain networks, characterized by GMV and iFC, as neural correlates. Concerning disorder selection, first, comorbidity levels among MDD, ANX, and CP are much higher than those with other disorders: for example, comorbidity between CP and MDD or ANX, respectively, is about 50\u201360% [ \u2013 ], and comorbidity of MDD and ANX is also 50\u201360% [ ]. Comorbidity rates with, for example, other psychiatric disorders are considerably lower, such as substance use disorder 10\u201330% [ ,  ,  ] or schizophrenia and bipolar disorder ca. 30% [ ,  ,  ]. Second, MDD, ANX, and CP share major risk factors: for example, chronic and\/or acute life stress overlap strongly between MDD, ANX, and CP [ ,  ]. Third, high comorbidity without a clear chronological sequence of disorders (MDD can precede CP, but also the other way round) as well as shared risk factors suggest one or several shared neuro-behavioral chronification mechanisms across MDD, ANX, and CP; such shared mechanisms might be complemented by additional distinct neuro-behavioral mechanisms reflecting distinct phenotypes of each disorder. Currently, one of the most promising candidates for a shared mechanism is maladaptive chronified \u2018threat behavior\u2019 [ ,  \u2013 ] (also called \u2018defensive behavior\u2019 [ ], \u201cavoidant behavior\u201d [ ], or \u2018negative-valence behavior\u2019 [ ]): in brief, low mood, anxiety, and pain all lead to avoidance and (social) withdrawal and therefore protection from (anticipated) threatening situations [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ]\u2014if these processes become detached from threats, i.e., if they chronify, they can result in maladaptive threat behavior, such as in MDD, ANX, and CP. Other promising candidates for separate [ ,  ,  ] or common basic neuro-behavioral mechanisms in MDD, ANX, and CP comprise, among others, aberrant reward [ ] or salience [ ] processing. Since these suggested mechanisms usually focus on explaining behavioral traits of depression, anxiety, and pain, most of these models\u2014independent of the exact nature of the underpinning neural mechanism\u2014can be applied best to MDD, ANX, and CP, where these symptoms are more prominent and critical than in other neurological\/psychiatric disorders. In this study, we did not directly probe specific behavioral aspects of such supposed neuro-behavioral mechanisms; instead, we focused on common and disorder-specific large-scale neural correlates, which allow to speculate about possible common and disorder-specific neuro-behavioral mechanisms supported by these neural correlates, thereby preparing future studies. \n\nConcerning neural correlates, we focused on intrinsic brain networks, i.e., highly consistent whole-brain patterns of coherent ongoing brain activity, such as the so-called default-mode network [ ,  ]. Intrinsic brain networks can be characterized by iFC among constituting regions and by GMV of these regions. We focused on intrinsic networks characterized by iFC and GMV since these neural correlates are large-scale and comparatively stable, both reflecting a \u201chistory\u201d of acquired\/learned (impairments of) behavior and shaping future behavior [ ]; therefore, they might mediate between microscopic mechanistic changes and behavioral functions and are predictive for longer-term behavioral traits such as low mood or anxiety [ ]. For this reason, task-based activation data, which reflect rather short-term reactions to external stimuli, were not investigated. Furthermore, other measures characterizing intrinsic networks, like structural connectivity, were not considered to keep pairwise multi-modal overlap analyses simple. Regarding iFC, we restricted our approach to whole-brain seed-to-voxel iFC-data as a kind of \u201csimple\u201d iFC, since more complex iFC-approaches, like graph analysis or dynamic iFC, cannot be integrated easily into meta-analyses of network-iFC. \n\nWe tested (i) which changes of regional GMV and network-iFC are   common   across MDD, ANX, and CP; (ii) which changes are   specific   (i.e., significantly more pronounced) to one of the three disorders; and (iii) whether and where specific GMV- and iFC-changes overlap [ ]. This approach is \u2018transdiagnostic\u2019 since it respects current diagnostic categories of MDD, ANX, and CP (while acknowledging their limitations), but also looks for commonalities across these categories [ ]. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nTo test our hypotheses, we employed well-established Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) for coordinate-based meta-analysis of brain imaging-studies (open-source code available at  ) [ ,  ]. We followed the analytic approach of grouping seed-based iFC-effects according to \u201cseed networks\u201d, which was first introduced by [ ] and since then applied by several studies [ ,  ,  ]. Since we [ ] and others have already described this approach in detail, we only give a brief description of our current approach (details in\u00a0 ). \n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nThe meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019119709;  ). Studies were searched until January 01, 2020 in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and reference lists of reviews and eligible articles, using the keywords   (rest* OR intrinsic) AND connect* AND seed* AND [disorder name]   for the iFC meta-analysis and   (\u201cVBM\u201d OR \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d) AND [disorder name]   for the GMV meta-analysis (disorder-specific details in Table\u00a0 ). All English-language publications of   whole-brain VBM   and   whole-brain seed-to-voxel iFC   comparing patients with MDD, ANX, or CP (with explicit diagnosis of the respective disorder, e.g., using DSM-5) to healthy subjects were selected following MOOSE guidelines for meta-analyses of observational studies (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ) [ ]; furthermore, a PRISMA checklist is attached. Briefly, exclusion criteria were (i) methods other than VBM or seed-based iFC; (ii) no whole-brain analysis; (iii) neurological (other than CP) or severe medical comorbidity (psychiatric comorbidity was no exclusion criterion); (iv) no peak-coordinates reported in standard space. In longitudinal or intervention\/challenge studies, only baseline results were considered. We made no restrictions concerning age, illness duration, symptom severity, or medication status to ensure maximal study coverage, but we conducted several control analyses later on. For further details about inclusion\/exclusion criteria, study quality control, and control variables, see\u00a0 .

For the iFC-meta-analysis, we took the following previously-used approach to meta-analytically investigate network-iFC based on whole-brain seed-to-voxel-iFC input studies (Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ) [ ,  ]: first, we extracted the center-coordinates of seed regions-of-interest from included iFC-studies. Second, we assigned each seed\u2014based on its anatomical location\u2014to one out of seven networks from a widely-used parcellation based on iFC-data from 1000 healthy subjects, comprising visual (VIS), primary-sensorimotor (PSM), dorsal attention (DAN), salience (SAL), limbic (LIM), frontoparietal (FPN), and default-mode (DMN) networks (Fig.\u00a0 ) [ ,  ,  ]. Since no similar network-parcellation was available for thalamus, studies using only thalamus or hypothalamus seeds were excluded (3 studies in total). Third, peak-coordinates of iFC between-group effects were extracted from included studies and grouped according to the network-assignment of their respective seed, yielding one list of between-group iFC-effects per network. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nMKDA meta-analysis of both GMV and network-iFC was conducted [ ,  ] following our previous work on transdiagnostic multimodal meta-analysis of structural and resting-state fMRI-studies across psychiatric disorders [ ]. For iFC, meta-analyses were only conducted for networks with at least three studies in each disorder to ensure sufficient power. For details on MKDA-meta-analysis, please see\u00a0 . MKDA yields result-maps which show a \u201cdensity statistic\u201d as effect size, reflecting the number of studies that found a group-difference at a particular brain location. Clusters with significantly aberrant GMV or seed-network-related iFC at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWER-corrected for false-positive results from multiple testing) are identified using Monte-Carlo simulations (15,000 iterations) [ ]; clusters significant both based on density statistic (height-based threshold, p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWER) and based on cluster size (extent-based threshold,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWER) are reported, for these thresholds convey complementary information [ ,  ]. We tested for   common   (i.e., observed in all three disorders) and   specific   (i.e., more pronounced in one\u00a0disorder than in the other two disorders) changes in MDD, ANX, and CP. \n\n GMV-changes and seed-network-related iFC-changes common to MDD, ANX, and CP   were identified via a two-step procedure: (i) Identification of consistent GMV-increase\/decrease and iFC-hyper\/hypoconnectivity, respectively, separately for MDD, ANX, and CP compared to healthy controls, using MKDA-meta-analysis (p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWER-corrected). (ii) Conjunction analysis to detect common GMV-increase\/decrease and iFC-hyper\/hypoconnectivity across MDD, ANX, and CP (  p  \u2009<\u20090.0015; details in\u00a0 \u2014Details of conjunction analyses) [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n GMV-changes and seed-network-related iFC-changes specific to MDD, ANX, and CP   were also identified via a two-step procedure: (i) Pairwise direct contrasts between single-disorder effects (e.g., more pronounced iFC-hyperconnectivity in MDD compared to ANX, i.e., MDD\u2009>\u2009ANX, or more correctly \u201c(MDD\u2009>\u2009HC)\u2009>\u2009(ANX\u2009>\u2009HC)\u201d), using MKDA-meta-analysis and subsequent conjunction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.005;  ) [ ]. (ii) Contrasts between one disorder and both other disorders (e.g., specific iFC-hyperconnectivity in MDD compared to   both   ANX and CP), using conjunction across pairwise contrasts (i.e., conjunction between MDD\u2009>\u2009ANX and MDD\u2009>\u2009CP) (p\u2009<\u20090.00005;  ) [ ,  ]. Thus, disorder-specific effects reflected, for example, regions in which MDD\u2009>\u2009HC hyperconnectivity was significantly more frequent across input studies than both ANX\u2009>\u2009HC and CP\u2009>\u2009HC hyperconnectivity. \n\nFinally,   regional overlap between specific GMV-changes and specific seed-network-related iFC-changes   was detected via conjunction of specific iFC-changes and specific GMV-changes (  p  \u2009<\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ;  ) [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nWe controlled for disproportionate influences of single studies and partial non-independence across studies (i.e., jackknife analyses), demographic (e.g., age, gender) and methodological factors (e.g., medication, global-signal-regression for iFC-analysis, modulation during VBM) via \u03c7\u00b2-tests (details in\u00a0 ) [ ,  ,  ]. Furthermore, we controlled for comorbidity across MDD, ANX, and CP by testing whether meta-analytic result-clusters showed significant differences in density-statistic when comparing studies   with   comorbidity to studies   without   comorbidity via \u03c7\u00b2-tests ( ). Comorbidity information was reported by about 85% of studies (Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ); comorbidity across included disorders was present in about one third of studies (Table\u00a0 ). Finally, as MKDA meta-analysis cannot deal with studies reporting no significant results (Table\u00a0  lists these studies), we used \u201cSeed-based d-Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI)\u201d to test whether excluding these studies biased results ( ) [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies \n  \nConcerning GMV, 63 MDD-studies (2934 patients\/3284 controls), 41 ANX-studies (1021\/1130), and 65 CP-studies (2185\/2358) were included (Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ). Concerning iFC, 68 MDD-studies (2314\/2141), 41 ANX-studies (1248\/1108), and 42 CP-studies (1229\/1114) were included (Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ). \n\nWhile   common   and   specific   GMV- and iFC-changes across MDD, ANX, and CP are reported next,   pairwise   contrasts between single disorders and healthy controls as well as across disorder pairs are described in\u00a0 , Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 , and Tables\u00a0 ,  ,  ,  , which\u00a0show p-values and density statistics representing effect sizes. \n\n\n### GMV-changes \n  \n#### Common GMV-changes \n  \nCommon GMV-decreases in MDD, ANX, and CP were found in bilateral insula (left\u2009>\u2009right), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and lateral PFC. GMV-decreases were mostly located in DMN (57%), SAL (26%), and PSM (10%) (networks with less than 10% overlap are not reported) (Fig.\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0  shows p-values). There were no significant clusters of common GMV-increase. As control, we also calculated conjunctions across pairs of disorders to compute pairwise overlaps of GMV-changes ( .\u00a0 \u2013 ).    Common and specific gray matter volume changes.  \n Specific   gray matter volume changes are depicted along the gray oval line; they were calculated by pairwise MKDA meta-analytic contrasts (e.g., MDD\u2009>\u2009ANX and MDD\u2009>\u2009CP) and subsequent conjunction across these pairwise result maps (  p  \u2009<\u20090.00005).   Common   gray matter volume changes across MDD, ANX, and CP are depicted in the center of the gray oval; they were calculated by separate MKDA meta-analytic contrasts of each disorder vs. healthy controls (e.g., MDD\u2009>\u2009HC) and subsequent conjunction across single-disorder results (  p  \u2009<\u20090.0015). For each contrast, meta-analytic regional result clusters are shown on the left. Their overlap with intrinsic brain networks [ ,  ,  ] is displayed on the right: GMV-decrease is shown in the outer ring, GMV-increase in the inner ring of each diagram; color intensity reflects the size of spatial overlap (the more voxels, the stronger the color\u2014a colorscale is added to each plot). ANX anxiety disorder, CP chronic pain, HC healthy controls, MDD major depressive disorder. \n  \n\n\n#### Specific GMV-changes \n  \n  MDD    .   No specific GMV-changes were identified (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n  ANX    .   We found specific GMV-decreases in bilateral hypothalamus, thalamus (mediodorsal, ventral lateral, and ventral anterior nuclei [ ]), striatum (putamen, ncl. accumbens), and insula (left: whole, right: posterior), right amygdala (mainly centromedial\/superficial nuclei [ ]), and left hippocampus (anterior and posterior), parahippocampal gyrus, temporal pole, and ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC). GMV-decreases were mainly located in DMN (37%), SAL (19%), LIM (16%), PSM (15%), and VIS (10%) (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n  CP    .   Specific GMV-increases were detected for bilateral hippocampus (left: whole, right: posterior), parahippocampal gyrus, and ncl. accumbens, left amygdala (basolateral and centromedial [ ]) and putamen, as well as right cerebellar hemisphere. Results were mainly located in LIM (33%) and DMN (31%). Specific GMV-decreases were found in right anterior insula, mainly located in SAL (66%) and FPN (27%) (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### iFC-changes \n  \nIFC-meta-analyses were conducted for PSM, SAL, LIM, FPN, and DMN networks, because common GMV-decrease overlapped with these networks (Fig.\u00a0 ) and at least three studies per disorder were available for them (Table\u00a0 ) [ ,  ]. \n\n#### Common iFC-changes \n  \nWe detected no significant clusters of common hyper- or hypoconnectivity across disorders (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). As control, pairwise conjunctions showed, exclusively, overlapping LIM-hypoconnectivity in right insula for MDD and ANX and in left medial\u00a0PFC for ANX and CP (Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 ).    Common and specific intrinsic functional connectivity changes.  \n Specific   intrinsic functional connectivity changes are depicted along the gray oval line; they were calculated by pairwise MKDA meta-analytic contrasts (e.g., MDD\u2009>\u2009ANX and MDD\u2009>\u2009CP) and subsequent conjunction across these pairwise result maps (  p  \u2009<\u20090.00005).   Common   intrinsic functional connectivity changes across MDD, ANX, and CP are depicted in the center of the gray oval; they were calculated by separate MKDA meta-analytic contrasts of each disorder vs. healthy controls (e.g., MDD\u2009>\u2009HC) and subsequent conjunction across single-disorder results (  p  \u2009<\u20090.0015). For each contrast, meta-analytic regional result clusters are shown on the left. Their overlap with intrinsic brain networks [ ,  ,  ] is displayed on the right in a \u201cchord diagram\u201d [ ]: between-network connectivity is shown as links, within-network connectivity as \u201chills\u201d; both color intensity and link thickness reflect the size of spatial overlap (the more voxels, the stronger the color and the thicker the link\u2014a colorscale is added to each plot). ANX\u2009 anxiety disorder, CP\u2009 chronic pain, HC healthy controls, iFC intrinsic functional connectivity, MDD major depressive disorder. \n  \n\n\n#### Specific iFC-changes \n  \n  MDD    .   We identified specific hyperconnectivity between DMN and left dlPFC. DMN-hyperconnectivity was located in FPN (70%), SAL (18%), and DMN (12%), indicating DMN-FPN, DMN-SAL, and within-DMN-hyperconnectivity (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). Specific hypoconnectivity was observed between LIM and right ventral putamen, amygdala (mostly basolateral, also parts of centromedial [ ]), and anterior insula. LIM-hypoconnectivity was mainly located in SAL (53%), FPN (25%), and LIM (15%), indicating LIM-SAL, LIM-FPN and within-LIM-hypoconnectivity. \n\n  ANX    .   Specific hyperconnectivity was detected between LIM and right cerebellum, angular\/supramarginal gyrus, and occipital cortex. LIM-hyperconnectivity was mainly located in PSM (39%), SAL (26%), LIM (14%), and DMN (10%), indicating LIM-PSM, LIM-SAL, within-LIM, and LIM-DMN-hyperconnectivity (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n  CP    .   We found specific hypoconnectivity between SAL and bilateral dmPFC, ACC, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and cuneus. SAL-hypoconnectivity was located mainly in DMN (72%) and VIS (16%), indicating SAL-DMN and SAL-VIS-hypoconnectivity. Further specific hypoconnectivity was identified between PSM and right posterior insula, putamen, STG, and vlPFC. PSM-hypoconnectivity was located mainly in PSM (54%), SAL (28%), and DMN (11%), indicating within-PSM, PSM-SAL, and PSM-DMN-hypoconnectivity (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Regional overlap between specific GMV-changes and specific iFC-changes \n  \nOnly for CP, we identified one small overlapping cluster (18 voxels): specific GMV-decrease converged with specific PSM-FPN-hypoconnectivity on right vlPFC (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nJackknife analyses showed no disproportionate influence of any single study on results (\u03c7\u00b2-tests:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.85 in the GMV-meta-analysis,   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.51 in the iFC-meta-analysis), meaning that the density-statistic of each significant result cluster did not change significantly after iteratively leaving out one study. Results were not significantly influenced by comorbidity across included disorders (GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.60, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.28), age (GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.16, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.30; influence of non-adult studies: GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.85, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.84), gender (GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.52, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.53), or medication (GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.48, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.37), nor by methodological factors like modulation during VBM (  p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.64) or global-signal-regression during iFC-analysis (  p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.63). Moreover,\u00a0including studies without significant results did not change meta-analysis\u00a0results (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Multimodal synopsis: common and specific large-scale brain changes \n  \nResults from a network perspective are summarized in Fig.\u00a0 , representing a synopsis of results from Figs.\u00a0  and  , thus providing an overview of which networks were multimodally affected.    Multimodal synopsis: common and specific patterns of large-scale brain changes.  \nOverlap of   common   and   specific   GMV-changes (from Fig.\u00a0 ) and iFC-changes (from Fig.\u00a0 ) with intrinsic brain networks [ ,  ,  ] is depicted in one \u201cchord diagram\u201d [ ] per contrast. The rings of each diagram reflect GMV-changes: GMV-decrease is shown in the outer ring, GMV-increase in the inner ring; color intensity reflects the size of the spatial overlap (the more voxels, the stronger the color\u2014a colorscale is added to each plot). In the center of each diagram, iFC-changes are displayed: between-network connectivity is shown as links, within-network connectivity as \u201chills\u201d; both color intensity and link thickness reflect the size of the spatial overlap (the more voxels, the stronger the color and the thicker the link\u2014a colorscale is added to each plot). ANX anxiety disorder, CP chronic pain, HC healthy controls, iFC intrinsic functional connectivity, MDD major depressive disorder. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing coordinate-based meta-analysis, we provide first-time evidence for common and specific large-scale brain changes in major depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain. Common changes concerned gray matter volume loss in insular and prefrontal cortices of default-mode and salience networks, suggesting a neural correlate for comorbidity and possibly shared chronification mechanisms. Specific gray matter volume and intrinsic functional connectivity changes of each disorder concerned default-mode, salience, limbic and sensorimotor networks; these changes might underlie distinct phenotypes and suggest additional disorder-specific mechanisms. \n\n### Common GMV-decrease across major depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain \n  \nWe found common GMV-decreases in insula and dorsomedial prefrontal\/anterior cingulate cortices, mostly located within DMN and SAL networks (Fig.\u00a0 ). Leave-one-out jackknife and post-hoc control analyses showed that results were not significantly influenced by any single study, comorbidity across included disorders, demographic\/clinical variables (age, gender, medication), or methodological issues (modulation during VBM, global-signal-regression, non-significant studies). \n\nOur result of common GMV-decrease facilitates new mechanistic and clinical insights. First, our study extends previous single-disorder meta-analyses of GMV-changes in MDD [ ], ANX [ ], and CP [ ]: via conjunction analysis, we showed directly, for the first time to our knowledge, an overlap between disorder-individual GMV-decreases in medial PFC\/ACC and insula, which had already been shown individually for the disorders; on the other hand, there was no overlap of GMV-increase. \n\nHigh comorbidity levels across MDD, ANX, and CP (50\u201360% [ \u2013 ]) without a clear chronological sequence of disorders (MDD can precede CP, but also the other way round) as well as shared risk factors suggest shared neuro-behavioral chronification mechanisms and underlying neural correlates. Common GMV-decrease might represent just such a neural correlate of high comorbidity, possibly reflecting a \u2018common core\u2019 of large-scale brain changes across the three disorders. This \u2018common core\u2019 might predispose\/increase the probability for further disorder-specific changes (possibly underlying distinct disorder phenotypes) in the future, leading to further disorder(s) as comorbidity. \n\nSecond, common GMV-decrease in medial PFC\/ACC and insula suggests shared neurobehavioral disease-mechanisms across MDD, ANX, and CP. One (but not the exclusive) candidate for such a common mechanism is maladaptive chronified threat behavior [ ,  \u2013 ], since medial PFC and insula have been implicated in both\u00a0the   learning\/persistence   and the\u00a0  control   of human threat behavior [ ,  ]. Therefore, impairments of medial PFC and insula circuits might play an important role in the chronification and maintenance of negative moods, anxiety, and pain \u2013 presumably via impaired control\/downregulation of threat behavior \u2013, leading to MDD, ANX, and CP, respectively. Other possible candidates for common mechanisms comprise aberrant reward processing [ ] or aberrant salience processing [ ]. For example, a recent review posited that deficits in\u00a0reward processing and learning, as shared vulnerability factors for MDD, ANX, and CP, underlie negative moods, anxiety, and reduced pain mitigation by external rewards, and are associated with a brain network comprising medial PFC and cingulo-insular cortices [ ]. Since we did not directly test for neuro-behavioral mechanisms in our study, our results should mainly be seen as a starting point for future studies specifically testing these hypotheses in MDD, ANX, and CP. \n\nThird, our study extends and contrasts with recent transdiagnostic meta-analyses of a wider range of psychiatric disorders (e.g., comparing MDD and ANX with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder instead of CP) [ ,  ,  ]: (i) we also included chronic pain\u00a0studies\u2014although psychiatric disorders and chronic pain are intimately related, they are often addressed by distinct research communities, which our work tries to integrate; (ii) we restricted disorder selection to MDD, ANX, and CP (excluding, e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) based on higher comorbidity among themselves than with other disorders, shared risk factors, and possible mechanistic overlaps; (iii) we combined GMV- and iFC-analyses in one framework. We found common\u00a0GMV-changes across MDD, ANX, and CP in insular, medial-prefrontal, and cingulate cortices. These changes are also present across several\u00a0other psychiatric disorders, e.g., also in schizophrenia [ ,  ], possibly hinting at brain region-pleiotropy, i.e., many-to-many-mappings between brain structure\/systems\/circuits and behavioral\/cognitive functions [ ]. For example, functions associated with insula and cingulate cortex are allostasis, interoception, and detection of salient stimuli [ ,  ], which are important for threat behavior, but also, for example, for reward processing. Hence, these regions are implicated in various disorders. \n\n\n### No common iFC-changes \n  \nIn contrast with common GMV-decrease, we identified no common iFC-changes (Fig.\u00a0 ). Single-disorder meta-analytic iFC-changes (the basis for transdiagnostic tests) were largely well consistent with previous meta-analyses investigating iFC-changes in MDD, ANX, and CP separately [ ,  ], confirming the reliability of our approach ( ). So why were there no common iFC-changes across all three disorders? From a general methodological perspective, firstly, GMV and iFC reflect distinct brain features or clusters of features (i.e., single-region brain structure vs. bi-\/multi-regional correlated blood oxygenation), which are not necessarily correlated, particularly since some disorders might be impaired in only one feature but not in the other. So, if there is no multi-modal overlap of changes, one can only conclude that distinct regions are aberrant regarding different features. Secondly, underlying factors of blood oxygenation-based iFC are heterogeneous: beyond neuronal processes, a couple of hemodynamic, vascular, and mediating control processes (e.g., astrocytes) underpin general neuro-vascular coupling between neuronal activity and blood oxygenation, which underlies BOLD iFC [ ]. These factors might distinctively contribute to aberrant iFC for different disorders, networks, or regions, inducing larger heterogeneity for iFC-findings than for GMV-findings, which in turn might prevent common iFC-changes across all three disorders. \n\nExplaining the absence of common iFC-changes concretely with our data, we firstly see that the spatial outline of iFC-changes is distinct across disorders, i.e., across disorders,\u00a0mostly different networks are affected. This distinct spatial outline is independent of network size or statistical power, since at least for default-mode network (\u226514 studies for each disorder) and salience network (\u226510 studies per disorder), power was well sufficient. Methodological heterogeneity is also a possible, but unlikely explanation, since methods of iFC-calculation\/preprocessing did not substantially differ across disorders or were controlled for in our control analyses. A possible functional implication of distinct iFC-changes could be that iFC might reflect disorder-specific functional impairments\/phenotypes that are associated with given networks. This \u2013 albeit speculative - interpretation is supported by the observation of disorder-specific iFC-changes. Secondly, the strength and\/or direction of iFC-changes differed across disorders, for example, for the auditory-sensorimotor network, we found hyperconnectivity in MDD, but hypoconnectivity in CP. This is a difficult topic as we do not have a clear interpretation of the quantitative nature of iFC-changes; therefore, we have to abstain from a functional interpretation. \n\nTaken together, the absence of common iFC-changes might derive from a combination of factors, which should be clarified by future studies. Also, the relation between iFC and threat behavior should be tested directly in the future. \n\n\n### Specific GMV- and iFC-changes \n  \nIn MDD, specific iFC-changes focused on DMN-FPN-hyperconnectivity (regionally located in dlPFC) and LIM-SAL-hypoconnectivity (in insula and ventral striatum) (Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 ). In ANX, specific changes focused on GMV-decrease in amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and insula (overlapping with DMN, SAL, LIM and PSM), and LIM-hyperconnectivity (predominantly with PSM and SAL, results located in parietal and cerebellar cortices). In CP, we found specific GMV-increase in hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and ventral striatum (overlapping mainly with LIM and DMN)\u00a0as well as GMV-decrease in insula (overlapping mostly with SAL and to a lesser degree with FPN), while specific iFC-changes centered on SAL-DMN-hypoconnectivity (in prefrontal-cingulate cortices) and to a lesser degree also on within-PSM-hypoconnectivity (in posterior insula and putamen). \n\nAlthough disorder-specific results were largely consistent with previous single-disorder meta-analyses that\u00a0separately compared MDD, ANX, and CP to healthy controls regarding GMV [ \u2013 ] and iFC [ ,  ] (for details, see\u00a0 ), the direct comparisons between disorders are, to our knowledge, novel. Three observations require further discussion: first, we observed no specific GMV-changes in MDD, although GMV-changes in MDD versus healthy subjects (Figure\u00a0 ,  ) were well compatible with previous meta-analyses [ ,  ,  ]. The lack of MDD-specific findings appears to derive from the fact that GMV-changes in MDD overlapped strongly with changes in ANX and CP (all vs. healthy controls, respectively), hence no GMV-changes\u00a0  specific   to MDD. From a more general perspective, the lack of specificity might derive from heterogeneity of MDD symptoms and their strong overlap with other disorders. Indeed, some meta-analyses detected no or only small converging effects across studies in MDD concerning GMV and also other measures like brain\u00a0activity related to cognitive and emotional processing [ ,  ]. \n\nSecond, specific GMV-decrease in ANX overlapped with common GMV-decrease across disorders: within our concept of specificity, this means that GMV-decrease in ANX vs. HC overlapped with the other disorders\u2019 changes vs. HC, but was significantly more pronounced. Future studies might further clarify the specificity of this finding, whether it is consistent across the course of ANX, and whether it is related to phenotypic specificity. \n\nThird, we found specific GMV-  increase   in CP only, and particularly in hippocampus and amygdala, where ANX showed specific GMV-  decrease  . The functional significance of this difference remains to be investigated; however, recent data and meta-analyses suggest a prominent role of medial-temporal areas, particularly the hippocampus, in CP pathophysiology. For example, medial-temporal volume and pain-related activity are associated with CP intensity [ ]. Interestingly, such a medial-temporal GMV-increase might have some potential for being a contrasting marker between CP and other psychiatric disorders; future comparison studies are needed to test its distinctive potential. \n\nRegarding the functional relevance of disorder-specific findings, we can only speculate, since we did not test the functional implications of these findings directly: disorder-specific changes might reflect distinct phenotypes of the disorders, which might be subserved by differential neuro-behavioral mechanisms complementing shared mechanisms. When considering maladaptive threat behavior as a possible shared mechanism, one could think of differentially pronounced impairments of parts of threat behavior [ ]: e.g., Pavlovian fear conditioning, associated with, e.g., insular and cingulate cortices [ ], which are more affected in ANX, or the cognitive regulation of aversive emotional states, often associated with prefrontal cortices [ ,  ], which are more affected in MDD and CP. Future transdiagnostic functional studies are necessary to test these assumptions. Until then, several candidate interpretations and mechanisms remain possible, for example also negative valence [ ] or a so-called \u2018pain network\u2019 [ ,  ], which overlaps with CP-specific changes. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nFirst, disorder-specific effects were calculated by directly contrasting single-disorder effects, which were based on comparisons vs. healthy controls. However, the identification of disorder-specific abnormalities is optimized in meta-analyses that draw upon empirical studies that, themselves, directly compared between diagnostic groups. Therefore, future meta-analyses focusing on transdiagnostic studies are needed, although it will currently be difficult to find enough input studies for this question. \n\nSecond, the identification of disorder-specific effects might be confounded by high levels of comorbidity across disorders\u2014here, in about one third of the included studies (Table\u00a0 ), reflecting the high comorbidity levels in MDD, ANX, and CP patients. In control analyses, we found no significant influence of comorbidity on our results. However, confounding effects cannot be ruled out completely, since about 15% of studies did not report comorbidity information (Table\u00a0 ) and, for example, MDD and ANX may be present in CP\u00a0patients in only subtle or \u2018forme fruste\u2019 fashion and therefore not reported by studies. \n\nThird, in DSM-5 as opposed to previous DSM\u00a0versions, PTSD is no longer included under ANX due to (among others) etiological considerations [ ]. We included PTSD within ANX because of the large phenomenological\/symptomatic overlap (for example hypersensitivity to perceived threats), which might rely on shared neuro-behavioral mechanisms [ ]. Nevertheless, we conducted a control analysis by excluding all PTSD-studies ( ). Results did not significantly differ from original results (\u03c7\u00b2-tests; GMV:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.85, iFC:   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.82), suggesting no significant bias from PTSD-studies. \n\nFourth, there were specific tendencies of seed distribution in each disorder: for MDD, most seeds were located in DMN, for ANX in LIM, and for CP in SAL (Table\u00a0 ). Since results were first synthesized within each disorder and only subsequently contrasted across disorders, we controlled for differences in number of studies per network. However, false disorder-specificity due to heterogeneous network-coverage cannot be fully excluded. \n\nFifth, due to our large-scale approach, our result of common GMV-decreases might miss subtle differences, e.g., regarding insula or ACC subregions [ ]. \n\nSixth, we controlled for medication in control analyses. However, as patients might have taken different groups of drugs (e.g., antidepressants or anxiolytics), which is not consistently reported by studies, some uncontrollable influences might remain. \n\nSeventh, we restricted our approach to seed-based iFC, because more \u2018complex\u2019\/data-driven iFC-measures, like ICA-components or graph-analysis measures, cannot be synthesized easily by coordinate-based meta-analysis. This means that all included iFC-studies had conducted hypothesis-driven analyses; seed selection of input studies could in theory bias our results, since some brain regions might be overrepresented as seeds. Yet, we think that our approach investigates whole-brain network-iFC, because we pooled together all seeds within a given intrinsic network, yielding a representative map of iFC\u00a0group differences of a particular network, and not just of individual seeds. Furthermore, input studies employed seeds covering wide areas of cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, and performed   whole-brain   seed-to-voxel iFC-analyses \u2013 therefore, no brain regions were selected or excluded a priori as iFC-targets [ ,  ]. Future studies should additionally consider other measures like dynamic iFC or structural connectivity [ ]. \n\nEighth, we grouped seed-regions based on network-assignment rather than based on anatomical location. This means that possibly quite distinct regions (concerning anatomy or function) were grouped together under the assumption of similar iFC-profiles (e.g., medial\u00a0PFC and precuneus, although anatomically and functionally distinct, were both grouped in the DMN). \n\nNinth, the included disorders are quite heterogeneous, e.g., MDD manifests itself in diverse symptoms, and CP encompasses different conditions like chronic back pain or fibromyalgia (for details on included conditions, see\u00a0 ). This issue, which is inherent in most psychiatric diagnostic categories, might reduce power and increase the risk of false-negative results. \n\nTenth, study quality has generally increased over the last two decades (e.g., regarding normalization accuracy or noise correction), so older studies might confound results. We included only very few studies from before 2010. Possible disproportionate influences from these studies were ruled out by jackknife analyses, which tested for the effects of individual studies on the results. The paucity of pre-2010 studies made other post-hoc analyses impossible. Even after 2010, potential changes in usage of noise correction methods might confound results; however, we observed no clear trends in usage of specific methods (Table\u00a0 ). \n\nEleventh, life stress as shared risk factor, as well as other unmeasured confounds, might constitute a confounding factor contributing to common brain changes. As it is hard to quantify, it is typically unmeasured; therefore, a control analysis was not possible. \n\nTwelfth, meta-analyses for iFC-networks were conducted if at least three studies per disorder were present, based on previous work [ ,  ]. A low number of studies might potentially compromise statistical power. However, for networks with significant disorder-specific results, mostly more than 20 studies were present per disorder, ensuring sufficient power [ ]. \n\nThirteenth, a wide range of phenotypically distinct anxiety disorders were included within the ANX group. We conducted pairwise post-hoc control analyses (for methodology, see other post-hoc analyses above) comparing results in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder (for power reasons, no other sub-groups could be formed; also, analyses had to be restricted to GMV). No significant difference between sub-groups was found (  p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.16). \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nWe found   common   reductions of gray matter volume in insula and medial\u00a0PFC across MDD, ANX, and CP, suggesting a shared neural correlate for comorbidity and possibly neuro-behavioral chronification mechanisms.   Disorder-specific   changes across distinct brain networks might underlie distinct phenotypes and possibly additional disorder-specific mechanisms. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8938548,"text_md5":"356341dfa485b34256480ff620762871","field_positions":{"authors":[0,161],"journal":[162,185],"publication_year":[187,191],"title":[202,398],"keywords":[412,465],"abstract":[478,2193],"body":[2202,44474]},"batch":1,"pmid":35058584,"doi":"10.1038\/s41386-022-01271-y","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8938548","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8938548"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8938548\">8938548<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8938548  Common and specific large-scale brain changes in major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain: a transdiagnostic multimodal meta-analysis of structural and functional MRI studies"}

Empathy for pain is a process in which people perceive, evaluate, and respond to the pain of others (Decety et al., 2008; Loggia et al., 2008). \n\nStudy of the brain\u2019s mechanisms of pain is progressing because of the development of neurophysiology and the wider application of imaging technology (Davis et al., 1997) in recent years. Empathy induced by pained expressions has realistic significance. Healthcare workers can be alert to patients\u2019 pain by watching their facial expressions. Picture-based paradigms (Simon et al., 2008) and cue-based paradigms (Lamm et al., 2011) are the main patterns applied to the study of empathy for pain. \n\nPresenting a series of images evokes empathy for pain from subjects in the former paradigm. Most of the images depict painful injuries in limbs or neutral situations (Kam et al., 2014), and some record pained expressions (Vachon-Presseau et al., 2012). Abstract visuals are applied in the cue-based paradigm. Most studies suggest that the insular and cingulate cortices are activated by empathy (Singer and Lamm, 2009). Brain mechanisms differ because of diverse factors, including positive and negative experience (Enzi et al., 2016). The brain regions activated can change according to changes in activation intensity. However, there are few studies concerning the mechanisms of empathy for pain elicited by pained expressions. \n\nOur aim was to perform a meta-analysis to integrate and interpret the relevant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies based on the differences in brain patterns elicited by pain. Using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method, the activated brain regions of merged samples were analyzed to explore the brain signal patterns associated with empathy for pain. \n\nALE is a kind of analysis method that is based on the voxel coordinates of the function of the brain regions positioning (Turkeltaub et al., 2002). ALE uses the three-dimensional Gaussian function smoothness and arranges inspection into the activated regional center coordinates described in multiple papers to define accurate positions of the activated brain regions. \n\nCompared with traditional chart review, the greatest advantage of ALE lies in its objective and quantitative analysis; in other words, ALE works in a voxel-by-voxel fashion (Laird et al., 2009), to avoid the subjectivity of traditional chart review. \n\n\n## Data and Methods \n  \n### Literature retrieval \n  \nStudies written in English were retrieved from Science Citation Index, Science Direct, PubMed, DeepDyve, Cochrane Library, SinoMed, Wanfang, VIP, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and other databases, such as SpringerLink, American Medical Association, Science Online, and Wiley Online. The research reported herein was undertaken with a time limitation of up to 13 December 2016. \n\nThe key words were \u201cfacial AND expression AND pain AND empathy AND fMRI (or functional MRI)\u201d. All authors participated in the literature search by computer and secondary search by hand. Unpublished literature was not included. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nThe studies were randomized controlled trials; the blinding method and the allocation concealment scheme were not taken into account when developing inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies presenting with all of the following criteria were considered for study inclusion: \n\n  \nUse of fMRI; \n  \nThe subjects were shown neutral and pained facial expression stimuli; \n  \nThe experiments involved adult healthy human participants. The basic state was painless. \n  \nThe subjects were over 18 years of age. \n  \nThe results were presented in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates. \n  \nMultiple studies by the same team as long as they used different raw data. \n  \n\n\n#### Exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies with one or more of the following conditions were excluded from this analysis: \n\n  \nStudies with data other than only facial expressions or short video stimulation. \n  \nIn addition to facial expressions, other stimuli were displayed in the picture or video. \n  \nAnimal studies. \n  \nAbstracts, summaries, case reports, minutes of meetings, lectures, and reviews. \n  \nUnpublished literature. \n  \n\n\n\n### Interventions \n  \nThe experimental group looked at a picture or short video, showing a volunteer with a pained expression. The control group looked at a picture or short video showing a volunteer with a neutral expression. \n\n\n### Literature screening and data extraction \n  \nThe data collected included: \n\n  \nTitle, author, and publication date. \n  \nExperimental group and (if used) control group information: Number of trials, proportion of male and female participants, average age, basic state, interventions, outcome indicators, and scanning methods. \n  \nBrain-related data: Brain area, hemisphere, voxel value (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ), coordinate system,   t   value, and   z   value. \n  \nStatistical information: statistical methods, positive and negative activation. \n  \n\n\n### Data processing and analysis \n  \n#### Coordinate transformation \n  \nThe Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation in GingerALE 2.3.6 software (Research Imaging Institute, San Antonio, TX, USA) was used to convert all coordinates to the Talairach coordinate system, and then all the converted coordinates were input into GingerALE 2.3.6 software for processing. A single data analysis was performed. \n\n\n#### Parameter setting \n  \nAccording to the maximum activation coordinates peak and the three-dimensional Gaussian distribution model, the specific parameters were set as follows:   P   value \u2264 0.01, minimum cluster volume > 200 mm . There was sufficient data to calculate brain ALE distribution. \n\n\n#### Image processing \n  \nMango 4.0.2 software (Research Imaging Institute) was used to map the three-dimensional coordinate data to the brain anatomical background of the Talairach coordinate space. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Retrieval results \n  \nA total of 440 studies were retrieved. Based on the title and abstract, 392 studies were excluded, including abstracts, summaries, minutes of meetings, lectures, and reviews, as well as non-fMRI studies. The full text of the remaining 48 studies was read by the two authors. Applying the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and interventions, 36 studies were initially considered and excluded. The full texts of the remaining 12 studies were read for the second time, and 4 studies with repetitive data or of low quality were excluded, leaving eight studies. Eight studies were considered in the final analysis (Budell et al., 1932; Botvinick et al., 2005; Simon et al., 2007; Danziger et al., 2009; Budell and Jackson, 2010; Eickhoff et al., 2012; Sheng et al., 2013; Hadjikhani et al., 2014) (   ). \n  \nFlow diagram of literature screening. \n  \n\n### Baseline data analysis and quality evaluation \n  \nBaseline data and quality evaluation are listed in    . \n  \nBasic inclusion criteria for articles \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis results \n  \nIncreased activation in the brain areas under the stimulation of facial expressions of pain (    and    ) showed 20 foci in eight trials with healthy subjects, including left precentral gyrus (BA44), left inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), bilateral middle temporal gyrus (BA37), right fusiform gyrus (BA37), left thalamus ventral lateral nucleus, bilateral putamen, bilateral amygdala, left cingulate gyrus (BA32), right middle temporal gyrus (BA39), right superior temporal gyrus (BA22), left inferior occipital gyrus (BA18), left middle occipital gyrus (BA18), right caudate body, left inferior occipital gyrus (BA19), right insula (BA13), left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), right middle frontal gyrus (BA46), and left inferior frontal gyrus (BA47). Because the activation in the brain areas of facial expression of pain is affected by age (Martin et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2006), the results are based on subjects in the young and middle ages ranging from 15\u201347 years. \n  \nBrain areas activated by the stimulation of facial expressions of pain \n    \nMain activated brain areas for empathy induced by images of pained facial expressions. \n\n(A\u2013D) The orange zones show that (A) the precentral gyrus (BA 44, \u221244, 12, 8), (B) the right insula (BA13, 56, \u221234, 22), (C) the right middle temporal gyrus (BA37, 42, \u221260, \u22122) and (D) the left cingulate gyrus (BA32, \u22124, 10, 40), which were activated under the stimulation of facial expressions of pain. The anterior cingulate cortex (BA32), anterior central gyrus (BA44), fusiform gyrus, and insula (BA13) were activated positively as major brain areas. BA: Brodmann area; (\u221244, 12, 8), (56, \u221234, 22), (42, \u221260, \u22122), (\u22124, 10, 40): Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPain is a physiological and psychological activity, including the feeling and response to pain (Li et al., 2018). Empathy refers to the process of experiencing the situation of others, so as to feel and understand the emotions of others. Empathy with pain is the individual\u2019s perception, judgment, and emotional response to the pain of others (Danziger, 2006). Existing studies using picture-based paradigms are inconsistent. We aimed to explore the sympathetic brain regions based on facial expressions from eight eligible studies. In this study, data from eight eligible studies were analyzed using GingerALE 2.3.6, and images were processed with Mango 4.0.1. Our results showed that the fusiform gyrus, cingulate gyrus, precentral gyrus, ventral lateral nucleus, inferior occipital gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and insula were activated by the sight of a person with a pained expression. \n\n### Pained facial expressions cause pain and empathy \n  \nPrevious studies have shown that the anterior cingulate gyrus and the insula belong to the painful sympathetic core networks (Gu and Han, 2007), which are responsible for the processing of emotional components of the pain experience (Price, 2000). The cingulate gyrus is associated with somatosensory awareness (especially pain perception related to emotional judgment) (Hsieh et al., 1996; Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd, 2007) and the regulation of physical and visceral activities; the anterior insula is associated with emotion, coordinating BA14, BA15, and BA16 to deal with sensory experience and to identify facial expression (Gornotempini et al., 2001). In this study, the cingulate gyrus (BA32) and inferior insula (BA13) were highly activated by the sight of pained expressions, indicating that, as with other experimental paradigms, the painful sympathetic core networks were also activated when watching others\u2019 pained facial expressions. This suggests that simply watching facial expression can activate the pain sympathetic core networks. In addition, the precentral gyrus (BA44) was also highly activated, which may be due to its mirrored neurons (Leube et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006). Through this neuronal activity, the observer consciously shows similar expressions or similar brain activities (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Keysers, 2009). Therefore, some scholars believe that it is because of the mirror neurons that humans have the ability to empathize (Cheng et al., 2008). \n\n\n### Pain empathy and physical pain have a common neural network \n  \nBy directly stimulating the brain, the activated brain areas generally include the primary sensory cortex (S1), secondary sensory cortex (S2), insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (Apkarian et al., 2005). The lateral thalamus is also involved in sensory formation (Ro et al., 2007). This study found that the brain areas activated by an expression of pain also include the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral lateral nucleus. A large number of studies have shown that activation by pain is mainly in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (Jackson et al., 2005, 2006; Ogino et al., 2006; Moriguchi et al., 2007; Morrison and Downing, 2007; Lamm et al., 2011), and these areas overlap with the responses of the brain to a pained expression. We can conclude that body pain and empathy for pain share some common parts of the nerve pathways, which mainly comprise the emotion-related brain areas. \n\n\n### Pain empathy mainly includes an emotional element, which is different from that of physical pain \n  \nThe sensory components of the pain experience are processed by the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1, S2), which is based on their anatomical structures and their connection with the subcortical region and the spine; thus, they primarily process and identify sensory stimulation of the body (Rainville et al., 1997; Rainville, 2002; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009). Because this study does not involve direct physical pain stimulation, the results do not contain S1 and S2. This reflects that empathy is an emotional experience rather than a somatic sensation. Studies have shown that the secondary sensory cortex and sensory motor cortex are activated only when there is direct stimulation by pain (Singer et al., 2004). These findings also support the findings of this study. However, some studies indicate that even in the absence of actual pain stimuli, the sensorimotor cortex will be activated (Ogino et al., 2006; Gu and Han, 2007). This may result from the differences in research paradigms and stimulus patterns (Lamm et al., 2011). It is noteworthy that some scholars have found that the empathetic brain areas and the emotional components of pain are not exactly the same (Jackson et al., 2006). This may indicate that pain empathy is not equivalent to pain emotional processing. \n\n\n### The brain areas associated with facial recognition and facial expression \n  \nThe brain regions involved in facial recognition may include the fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, anterior central gyrus, and insula (Saarela et al., 2007; Zhen et al., 2013). In this study, the brain area associated with simple face recognition is mainly the fusiform gyrus. The fusiform gyrus is located between the temporal gyrus and the hippocampus, with the ability to recognize a face and body. The region within that responsible for face recognition is called the fusiform face area (Kanwisher et al., 1997; Slotnick and White, 2013; Axelrod and Yovel, 2015). The fusiform face area can produce similar recognition for non-face visual images (McCarthy et al., 1997; Rossion et al., 2000), which is a prerequisite for facial perception and is associated with the posterior temporal gyrus (BA21), both belonging to the visual cortex. However, the fusiform gyrus is not only activated under the stimulation of facial expressions; although the fusiform face area is a part of the fusiform gyrus and is responsible for face recognition, the fusiform gyrus has further functions, such as processing information on non-facial stimulation. Studies have shown that the fusiform gyrus is also activated in subjects who are watching others\u2019 hands and feet (Eidelman-Rothman et al., 2016), indicating that it is widely involved in general recognition. \n\n\n### Facial expression recognition and general simple visual stimulation are different \n  \nInvestigating studies using the picture paradigm, this analysis is bound to find data involving the activation of visual pathways (Deyo et al., 2004). \n\nThe suboccipital region (BA18) is the secondary visual cortex, and together with BA19 constitutes the visual cortex. However, the visual cortex was not highly activated. This indicates that during pain empathy caused by watching a pained expression, the production of visual information is only a relatively minor stage. Combined with the fusiform gyrus, which is highly activated, it can be seen that the recognition and processing of faces and facial expressions are the leading steps: in other words, the activation of the brain area involved in facial recognition distinguishes stimulation by facial expression from stimulation by nonfacial images. \n\nFrom the results of our study, the occipital lobe, the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the limbic system were differently and strongly activated. Based on the existing studies and combined with this meta-analysis, we can make assumptions that an image of a pained facial expression produces a pain sympathetic activation of the brain regions as follows: \n\nThe pained facial expression image can stimulate the emotional network, which produces spontaneous emotion processing. The image activates the occipital lobe first, followed by the temporal lobe, the insula, the limbic system, and other emotional networks. Among them, the frontal lobe processes the emotional stimulation. In other words, the frontal lobe processes awareness through the integration of physical and subjective feelings and objective information (Osborn and Derbyshire, 2010). \n\nIn addition, the human brain will produce direct emotions compared with the self\u2019s existing emotional experience, and will then recognize the emotions caused directly by some certain stimuli and find the part that belongs to the empathetic feelings. The prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and other brain areas related to memory and cognition were activated after the emotional network was activated. The cingulate gyrus, hippocampal gyrus, and other parts of the pain sympathetic core network are strongly activated, and then the empathy for pain occurs (Zhou et al., 2004). \n\nThe limitations of this study are as follows: (1) Despite repeated searches and manual review, the number of included studies is still insufficient: the sample capacity is small, and can easily cause statistical error. (2) Parts of the studies did not test the subjects\u2019 ability for empathy (Mazza et al., 2015), leading to a decline in the quality of this article. (3) Because of an insufficient number of articles, we did not divide the stimulating methods into two groups (static pictures and dynamic short videos), and we did not distinguish between a first-person perspective (imagining that you are suffering the same painful experience as a character in the picture) and a third-person perspective (imagine yourself witnessing the suffering of the characters in the picture).. \n\nIn conclusion, the ALE analysis showed that the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, anterior central gyrus (BA44), and fusiform gyrus were activated positively in response to images of pained facial expressions. Pained facial expressions activated the brain regions related to pain empathy, including areas of the emotional circuit and facial recognition, further contributing to revealing the brain\u2019s mechanisms of pain empathy. \n\n Additional file:   .  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6262989,"text_md5":"678dbfe8b0204f9a913a79944f976f53","field_positions":{"authors":[0,106],"journal":[107,123],"publication_year":[125,129],"title":[140,284],"keywords":[298,544],"abstract":[557,2423],"body":[2432,21249]},"batch":1,"pmid":30531091,"doi":"10.4103\/1673-5374.243722","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6262989","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6262989"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6262989\">6262989<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6262989  Brain pathways of pain empathy activated by pained facial expressions: a meta-analysis of fMRI using the activation likelihood estimation method"}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a brain imaging technique that can be used to demonstrate neural activation to emotionally salient stimuli. However, no attempt has yet been made to statistically collate fMRI studies of brain activation, using the activation likelihood-estimate (ALE) technique, in response to emotion recognition tasks in individuals with SAD.   Methods:   A systematic search of fMRI studies of neural responses to socially emotive cues in SAD was undertaken. ALE meta-analysis, a voxel-based meta-analytic technique, was used to estimate the most significant activations during emotional recognition.   Results:   Seven studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, constituting a total of 91 subjects with SAD, and 93 healthy controls. The most significant areas of activation during emotional vs. neutral stimuli in individuals with SAD compared to controls were: bilateral amygdala, left medial temporal lobe encompassing the entorhinal cortex, left medial aspect of the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus, right anterior cingulate, right globus pallidus, and distal tip of right postcentral gyrus.   Conclusion:   The results are consistent with neuroanatomic models of the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning, and the importance of the limbic circuitry in mediating anxiety symptoms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD), or generalized social phobia (GSP), the more pervasive and severe subtype of SAD, are characterized by fear and anxiety in social situations, with individuals experiencing significant concerns about feeling embarrassed or publicly humiliated (American Psychiatric Association,  ). SAD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, which is characterized by significant chronicity and morbidity (Stein and Stein,  ). Symptoms often begin during adolescence, with 80% of cases occurring before the age of 18 years (Otto et al.,  ) and if left untreated, are frequently accompanied in later life by depression, substance use disorders, and other anxiety disorders (Watson et al.,  ). \n\nGiven the availability of functional imaging techniques, a growing literature on the neural circuitry of SAD has developed (e.g., Freitas-Ferrari et al.,  ). This has led to neurobiological models of SAD implicating a limbic-medial prefrontal circuit in terms of cognitive bias for heightened saliency of negative emotional information (for reviews, see Etkin,  ,  ). Specifically, social anxiety in SAD may be mediated by hyperactivation of limbic regions, such as the amygdalae and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), paralimbic regions such as the hippocampus and insular cortex, combined with aberrant top-down cognitive control of arousal and anticipated fear\/perceived threat, especially in relation to the self as represented in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). \n\nPrevious meta-analyses confirm that the amygdala is highly responsive to explicit (Costafreda et al.,  ) and subliminal (Brooks et al.,  ) emotional stimuli, particularly human faces. Moreover, previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews of SAD concur that the amygdalae, as well as the insular cortex are hyper-active in response to emotional stimuli, compared to specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and healthy controls (Etkin and Wager,  ; Freitas-Ferrari et al.,  ). This is consistent with imaging studies of fear in healthy subjects, which observe that the amygdala and insula are activated in fear paradigms across 55 PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (though the insula, as well as the anterior cingulate, appeared to be more selectively engaged by cognitive aspects of the tasks employed) (Phan et al.,  ). \n\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of activation coordinates extracted from fMRI studies of individuals with SAD that used an emotion recognition paradigm. The meta-analysis was conducted using activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a voxel-based meta-analytic technique that allows one to generate parametric maps of consistent activation across different imaging studies (Laird et al.,  ). We hypothesised that, when passively responding to emotional (vs. neutral) stimuli, individuals with social anxiety (compared to controls) have greater activation in regions associated with emotion regulation, such as the amygdala, insular cortex, basal ganglia, and ACC. \n\n\n## Methodology \n  \n### Definition of social anxiety \n  \nSAD is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur, while GSP is characterized when the fears are related to most social situations (e.g., initiating or maintaining conversations, participating in small groups, dating, speaking to authority figures, and attending parties). Both encompass symptoms of being negatively evaluated in social situations, particularly in relation to self-performance (Stein and Stein,  ). This fear of public scrutiny often leads to avoidance of social situations and biases in social and emotional information processing, particularly of facial expressions (Ekman,  ), and comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Kaufman and Charney,  ; Kessler et al.,  ). In all studies included in this review, SAD participants were diagnosed according to standardized DSM IV-TR criteria. \n\n\n\n## Study identification \n  \nPotentially eligible studies that examined individuals with SAD were identified through conducting a search of PubMed, using a combination of the following terms: fMRI, functional magnetic resonance, social anxiety, and social phobia. Study inclusion was restricted to whole-brain (and not region of interest) fMRI studies of emotion recognition in which healthy controls were compared with participants diagnosed with SAD or GSP according to standardized diagnostic criteria as described above. \n\n\n## Selection process \n  \nThe selection process took place in three stages. Two independent reviewers firstly assessed the titles and retrieved articles for relevance. Second, the articles that remained eligible were assessed based on the abstract to determine whether any inclusion criteria were not met. The full text of all remaining articles was then assessed using with a data extraction template, constructed for the purpose of organizing and extracting information from included articles. Following this procedure, 244 initial publications were found, which were reduced to 44 after examining the title and abstract. A total of 7 out of 44 studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria, resulting in a combined sample of 91 subjects with SAD and 93 healthy controls. \n\n\n## Data synthesis and activation likelihood-estimation (ALE) \n  \nALE was conducted using GingerALE software ( ), a contemporary method to analyse brain imaging data. MRICron (REF) was used to illustrate the results. Data from studies reporting Talairach stereotactic (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) coordinates were extracted and subsequently referred to as foci. We used foci from all studies representing greater activation in cases (vs. controls) to emotional (vs. neutral) stimuli. Studies reporting foci in other atlases (e.g., AFNI, MNI) were converted using the GingerALE convert foci tool. ALE involves the generation of a statistical parametric map (SPM) of brain activation, in this case, in response to a task (emotion recognition), through the quantitative synthesis of whole-brain coordinate data across multiple studies. The likelihood that activation in particular voxels occurs by chance is determined through reference to an empirically derived probabilistic map of brain activity (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). ALE utilizes voxel-wise resolution of study-level data, avoiding between-study heterogeneity in the positioning of activated voxels via measurement error, which bypasses reliance on publication-specific anatomical labeling (Laird et al.,  ). \n\nFor this ALE, the latest version of the ALE software (Eickhoff et al.,  ) was used, with correction using False Discovery Rate (FDR) at   p   = 0.05 and a minimum cluster threshold of 160 mm . Previous versions of GingerALE calculated the probability of voxel activation in the brain on the basis of all foci reported in studies, as if these 3D coordinates were independent of each other. This was problematic, given that those studies reporting a higher number of coordinates (perhaps because they used a lower statistical threshold) would receive more weight with regard to their contribution to the meta-analysis. The latest version of GingerALE (version 2.1.1), on the other hand, identifies each reported coordinate within the study that generated it, by obtaining a single modeled activation (MA) map for each study. The probability that a particular voxel is activated is then calculated as the union of the probabilities for that voxel across studies. This revised algorithm allows weighting for the precision location of the foci reported by each study, based on its sample size (technically, by calculating a study-specific Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) value which determines how widely-dispersed or \u201cblurred\u201d that activation is). The algorithm assumes that larger studies provide more reliable estimates of activation. The lastest version of GingerALE also restricts voxels of interest to those areas of the brain which have a greater than 10% probability of containing gray matter, as no BOLD signal will typically be observed in white matter. \n\n### Emotion regulation paradigms \n  \nFive out of the seven studies included in this meta-analysis presented emotional vs. neutral faces (Phan et al.,  ; Yoon et al.,  ; Evans et al.,  ; Goldin et al.,  ; Klumpp et al.,  ), whereas the remaining 2 studies used emotional statements (Blair et al.,  ,  ). For example, of the studies presenting faces, participants were required to; (a) rate how happy, sad, and neutral faces looked, after the scan (Evans et al.,  ), (b) to cognitively engage (downplay their emotional response using thoughts, as done in pre-scan trial) or simply look at emotional faces (Goldin et al.,  ), (c) press a button in the scanner to identify type of emotion (positive, negative, neutral) on the face (Phan et al.,  ; Yoon et al.,  ). The 2 studies presenting emotional statements asked participants to think about somebody they know giving a positive, negative, or neutral statement about them or somebody else, and to press a button during the scan when they had read the statement (Blair et al.,  ,  ). All studies had variations on the emotional theme, but all had in common that emotion recognition occurred. \n\n\n\n## Data extraction \n  \nThe data extracted included; (a) author names, (b) date of publication, (c) journal name, (d) digital object identifier, (e) type of emotion recognition task, (f) subject group numbers, (g) comorbidities and medication, (h) mean age with standard deviation, (i) ratio of gender, and (j) neural activation coordinates. All data included in this meta-analysis are derived from between-subject activation to emotion recognition tasks. In other words, the neutral condition (e.g., neutral faces, statements) is first subtracted by the authors' from the emotion condition (e.g., emotional faces, statements), and the residual activation is compared between cases and controls. The case vs. control comparison is reported as between subject foci in each paper included in this meta-analysis. We illustrate the results using Mango ( ) and MRICron ( ). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nStudy characteristics and subject demographics are summarized in Table  .

Statistically significant increases in activation in response to emotion recognition in individuals with SAD compared with healthy controls was found in the following areas: the right amygdala (  x   = 26,   y   = \u22128,   z   = \u221220), left amygdala (  x   = \u221222,   y   = \u22124,   z   = \u221222), left medial temporal lobe encompassing amygdala and entorhinal cortex (Brodmann area 34,   x   = \u221214, \u22124, \u221216), left medial aspect of the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus (  x   = \u221226,   y   = \u221220,   z   = \u221220 Brodmann area 35), right anterior cingulate (ACC, Brodmann area 34   x   = 6,   y   = 4,   z   = 36), right globus pallidus (  x   = 20,   y   = \u22122,   z   = \u22128) and distal tip of right postcentral gyrus (  x   = 50,   y   = \u221212,   z   = 18) (Brodmann,  ). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nFor the first time, we present an activation-likelihood meta-analysis of fMRI studies examining the effects of emotion recognition on brain responses in those with SAD. Our most robust finding was that limbic regions were consistently more active in SAD patients than compared with controls in response to emotional stimuli. Specifically, we found significant activation in the bilateral amygdala, left medial temporal lobe, encompassing the entorhinal cortex, left medial aspect of the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus, right anterior cingulate, right globus pallidus, and the distal tip of the right postcentral gyrus. It is of note that we found no significant activation of PFC regions, such as the mPFC, which perhaps indicates some competitive interference of arousal brain circuits on higher order functioning, in those with SAD (e.g., for reviews see Etkin,  ,  ). \n\nActivation of the bilateral amygdala in response to emotional stimuli was our strongest result. The amygdalae are subcortical gray matter nuclei involved in processing visual emotional cues, particularly signaling fear, aversion, or general salience (Phan et al.,  ). Our data supports previous meta-analyses demonstrating the role of amygdala activation in response to explicit (Costafreda et al.,  ) and subliminal (Brooks et al.,  ) emotional stimuli, particularly in faces. Moreover, previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews of SAD indicate hyperactivity in the amygdalae in response to emotional stimuli (Etkin and Wager,  ; Freitas-Ferrari et al.,  ). It is of note that the previous meta-analyses of SAD differ from ours in that they did not use the ALE approach, which is a well-validated, systematic, and computational method to objectively to meta-analyse neural activations (Radua et al.,  ). For example, Etkin and Wager ( ) fMRI and PET studies reporting on SAD, specific phobia, PTSD and fear conditioning, and found similar neural activation in these groups. Furthermore, Freitas-Ferrari et al. ( ) conducted a systematic review of fMRI, PET, SPECT, MRS, and structural MRI in studies examining SAD, and reported amygdala and other limbic region activations. The added value of our meta-analysis is that we use ALE to focus only on fMRI studies during emotion recognition in SAD. Thus, our and previous meta-analytic and review data robustly implicate the role of the bilateral amygdala in emotional processing. Specifically, hyperactivation of the amygdalae likely contributes to the mediation of SAD, particularly when viewing emotional information from people's faces. \n\nAnimal literature is also concurrent with the observation in this meta-analysis that bilateral hyperactivity in the amygdala occurs when viewing stimuli perceived as emotionally threatening or aversive (de Carvalho et al.,  ). For example, projections from the amygdala to the brainstem contribute to a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d response in animals and humans to potentially salient stimuli, and projections from the amygdala to the cortex simultaneously contribute to the experience of other cognitive aspects of emotional processing (LeDoux,  ). However, data suggests that the function of the amygdala extends beyond fear processing and is involved in processing of general salience and arousal to both positive and negative emotional processing (Siebert,  ). Thus, hyper-arousal in limbic brain circuits, regardless of the valence of the emotional stimulus, may underlie the mediation of SAD. \n\nWe also observed greater activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (BA34, 35) in those with SAD, consistent with the involvement of this structure in Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning in both animals and humans (Alvarez et al.,  ). Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging in SAD also noted greater activation in this region (Etkin and Wager,  ; Freitas-Ferrari et al.,  ). Parahippocampal hyperactivation in SAD has been interpreted as indicative of disruptions to contextual fear conditioning and an inability to assign accurate saliency value to a stimulus. Additionally, increases in gray matter volume in the parahippocampus have been demonstrated in SAD (Talati et al.,  ), indicative of plasticity that may underlie hyperactivity in this region. \n\nThe ACC showed greater activation in SAD compared to healthy controls in this meta-analysis. Animal and human studies demonstrate that the ACC plays a key role in the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing (Whalen et al.,  ; Bush et al.,  ), particularly in relation to conflict monitoring\/error detection of discrepancies between predicted and actual outcomes (Botvinick and Watanabe,  ; Yeung and Nieuwenhuis,  ; Kim et al.,  ). Moreover, the ACC is highly activated during the anticipation of pain (Straube,  ). Activation of the ACC may therefore point to compensatory efforts to regulate high anxiety states in individuals with SAD, or the anticipation that a socially-painful experience may subsequently ensue. The findings here are again consistent with those of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses in SAD (Etkin and Wager,  ; Freitas-Ferrari et al.,  ). Finally, alterations in gray matter volumes have recently been associated with anxiety disorders, especially in the ACC region (Radua et al.,  ), however, it is still unclear how structural differences relate to functional aberrations in this region. \n\nWe are the first to demonstrate in a meta-analysis that increased activation of the globus pallidus is associated with SAD. The globus pallidus appears to play an important role in motor control (Salih et al.,  ). One possibility therefore is that activation of this area reflects disruption of the motor system as a component of the emotional response in SAD. However, the globus pallidus has also been implicated in affect regulation (Murphy et al.,  ), and in both the processing of information from complex stimuli and in aversive responses to fear and anxiety (Talalaenko et al.,  ). Thus, activation in this region may reflect increased statistical power of this meta-analysis relative to those previously conducted. \n\nAdditionally, hyperactivity in the distal tip of the right postcentral gyrus was observed. This area has previously been implicated in conveying pure somatosensory information of an auditory nature (Job et al.,  ). Literature on the functional significance of BA 43 in SAD is lacking, but it seems reasonable to suggest that hyperactivity in this region in people with SAD may be associated with a state of hypervigilance, often in concurrence with anxiety states. \n\nOur data is in line with contemporary neural models of anxiety disorders (for reviews, see Etkin,  ,  ). Specifically, a limbic-medial prefrontal circuit is implicated in an aberrant information processing circuit, whereby negative socio-emotional information is given greater salience, due to activation of limbic arousal circuits. Furthermore, the medial prefrontal, self-referential system is perhaps overloaded by bottom-up arousal information, biasing negative emotional stimuli, particularly in relation to the self, such that the value of the external stimulus is heightened, and the value of self-related goals, such as autobiographical memory, self-goals, and experience-based competence are reduced. However, there were a number of regions emphasized in the literature as important components of aberrant brain activity in SAD that were not evident in this meta-analysis. Of particular note, insula activation did not differentiate SAD from healthy controls, despite the recognition of the importance of this structure in mediating anxiety (Craig,  ; Holzschneider and Mulert,  ). This may reflect the emphasis on responding to external fearful stimuli rather than to interoceptive signals in the particular paradigms deployed in the included studies (Paulus and Stein,  ). \n\nThere are some limitations to our meta-analysis that must be considered and which may temper the strength of our findings. Firstly, only 7 fMRI studies, with small sample sizes were included. In addition, two of these studies employed a paradigm which did not rely on emotional recognition of facial expressions. Furthermore, due to the small samples, it is difficult to investigate how socio-demographic variables or neurobiological factors (e.g., gene variants) contribute to the brain activation we observe. Nevertheless, this study is the first to conduct an activation-likelihood meta-analysis of fMRI studies examining neural correlates of emotion recognition in SAD. Our findings support a growing body of work on development of a neurocircuitry model of SAD. Future work on larger samples, including perhaps collaborations across different sites, is needed to address more comprehensively some of the likely sources of inter-individual variance (Furmark et al.,  ; Smoller et al.,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis confirms that increased activation of the bilateral amygdala is a prominent feature in those with SAD, particularly in response to socially emotive stimuli. The contribution of other brain regions implicated in neurobiological models of SAD, such as parahippocampus and anterior cingulate, are also highlighted (Morgan et al.,  ). Thus, hyperactivation of limbic circuitry likely mediates the symptoms of SAD, and may be a target for clinical interventions and future research. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3547329,"text_md5":"71554bb8e04a641a2d98a85fd5bdb7ed","field_positions":{"authors":[0,116],"journal":[117,135],"publication_year":[137,141],"title":[152,283],"keywords":[297,365],"abstract":[378,1876],"body":[1885,24277]},"batch":1,"pmid":23335892,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2012.00347","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3547329","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3547329"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3547329\">3547329<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3547329  Functional magnetic resonance imaging during emotion recognition in social anxiety disorder: an activation likelihood meta-analysis"}

Studies based upon functional MRI (fMRI) showed the alterations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in multiple brain regions pertaining to depression in PD. However, large variance was observed across previous studies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the results in previous publications and completed an independent regions-of-interests (ROIs)-based analysis using our own data to validate the results of the meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify fMRI studies in PD patients with depression. Using signed differential mapping (SDM) method, we performed a voxel-based meta-analysis. Then, a validation study by using multiscale entropy (MSE) in 28 PD patients with depression and 25 PD patients without depression was conducted. The fMRI scan was completed in anti-depression-medication-off state. The ROIs of the MSE analysis were the regions identified by the meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 126 PD patients with depression and 153 PD patients without depression were included in meta-analysis. It was observed that the resting-state activities within the posterior cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum were altered in depressed patients. Then, in the validation study, these regions were used as ROIs. PD patients with depression had significantly lower MSE of the BOLD fluctuations in these regions (posterior cingulate gyrus:   F   = 0.856,   p   = 0.049; SMA:   F   = 0.914,   p   = 0.039; cerebellum:   F   = 0.227,   p   = 0.043). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study revealed that the altered BOLD activity in cingulate, SMA, and cerebellum of the brain were pertaining to depression in PD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most important age-related neurodegenerative disorder in older adults. PD patients suffer from multiple non-motor symptoms together with the motor issues. One of the most common non-motor symptoms in PD is depression, which impairs both mental and physical function and diminishes a person\u2019s quality of life ( ;  ). Depression in PD is believed to be closely associated with pathological changes in neurotransmitter systems ( ). During the last decade, studies using positron emission tomography (PET) observed that dopamine transporter availability and noradrenergic innervation in the striatum and limbic brain regions were reduced in PD patients with depression compared to PD patients without depression ( ;  ); and the alterations in dopamine transporter availability and noradrenergic innervation influence neural activity in cortical regions ( ;  ). Depression is also characterized by deficits of excitatory glutamate neurons and inhibitory GABA interneurons ( ). Evidence of associations between glutamate and\/or GABA levels and fMRI signal was found recently ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, characterization of the altered cortical neural activities in PD patients with depression is of great significance to help better understand the pathology underlying it, which can help optimize the design of therapeutic strategies and protocols for PD patients with depression. \n\nMultiple studies have characterized resting-state brain activities in PD patients with depression by measuring the dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Most results showed that alterations in PD patients with depression were predominantly in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system ( ;  ). However, the sample sizes of the studies were relatively small, and large variances in study protocol and data analytic techniques were observed between studies ( ). For example, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) is used to detect the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal ( ),   and   observed increased ALFF in the temporal lobe, while   reported similar ALFF values in this area ( ;  ). The regional homogeneity (ReHo) calculates the synchronization of low-frequency fluctuations between a given voxel with neighboring voxels ( ), and the degree centrality (DC) value calculates the centrality of a node by adding the centrality of adjacent nodes ( ).   and   reported alterations in DC and ReHo in the lingual gyrus and supplementary motor area (SMA) in PD patients with depression; however, other studies did not find significant differences in the lingual gyrus and SMA between groups. These kinds of inconsistency across studies thus largely limit the understanding and characterization of the neural-physiologic mechanisms underlying depression in PD. \n\nHere, we therefore performed a coordination-based meta-analysis with the goal of quantitatively and systematically examining the results from previous studies. To validate the results of meta-analysis, we performed a region-of-interest (ROI)-based study using fMRI data from 28 PD patients with depression and 25 PD patients without depression. The regions identified in our meta-analysis were used as ROIs of the analysis. The previous studies in our meta-analysis used various method of analysis, including ALFF, ReHo, and DC, which reflected the alteration of BOLD signals on a single scale. However, it is known that resting-state neural activities within the brain are regulated by multiple components across multiple scales of time, ranging from milliseconds (e.g., the time to transmit neural impulses) to hours or days (e.g., circadian rhythms). The multiscale dynamics of resting-state BOLD fluctuations are thus complex, which provides key information on neurophysiological regulations ( ). Studies have emerged to characterize such complex dynamics by using multiscale entropy (MSE) and have demonstrated that resting-state BOLD complexity is closely associated with important functional performance ( ;  ). Here, we also used MSE to characterize the complexity of BOLD fluctuation in each ROI. Our primary hypothesis is that the complexity of BOLD fluctuations within those ROIs would be lower in PD patients with depression as compared to PD patients without depression, confirming the findings in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Meta-Analysis \n  \n#### Search Strategies \n  \nWe searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using the following free-text terms: (\u201cParkinson\u2019s disease\u201d OR \u201cPD\u201d) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cBOLD\u201d OR \u201cblood oxygen level dependent\u201d OR \u201cALFF\u201d OR \u201camplitude of low frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cReHo\u201d OR \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d OR \u201cDC\u201d OR \u201cdegree centrality\u201d OR \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d OR \u201cFC\u201d) AND (\u201cdepression\u201d OR \u201cdepressed\u201d OR \u201cmood\u201d OR \u201cemotion\u201d OR \u201cemotional\u201d OR \u201cpsychology\u201d OR \u201cpsychological\u201d OR \u201cneuropsychological\u201d OR \u201cpsychiatric\u201d OR \u201cneuropsychiatric\u201d). Next, we examined the references of the included studies to identify additional eligible publications. The final search was completed in March 2021. \n\n\n#### Study Selection \n  \nAfter the literature search, a total of 2,312 articles were retrieved. We first removed the duplicates from the search results. Then, full text reports were obtained and screened in detail. The inclusion criteria were: (1) resting state fMRI studies comparing a group of PD patients with depression with a sample of PD patients without depression; (2) studies using metrics for measuring local characteristics of resting state fMRI data (Such as ReHo, DC, or ALFF\/fALFF) and based on the whole brain analysis; (3) studies reporting results with coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) review articles, case reports and editorial letters; (2) conference proceedings without full report publication; (3) participates duplicate; (4) undefined PD patients with depression or not enough information provided to determine whether depression was present; (5) no resting state fMRI. For all the articles that no whole brain results were reported in the papers, we contact the corresponding authors but there was no response we can receive. Any disagreement between the two researchers was resolved by discussion or consulting a third specialist. The study selection process is presented in a PRISMA flowchart. \n\n\n#### Data Extraction \n  \nTwo researchers independently extracted data, and discrepancies were resolved in a consensus meeting. When no consensus was reached, a third specialist was consulted. From all eligible studies, we extracted the following information: first author, year of publication, sample size, MRI type, analysis method, statistical threshold, standard stereotactic space and patient characteristics [age, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, medication state, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) score, and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score et al.]. We also extracted peak coordinates and effect size measures of regions with a significant difference between the PD patients with depression and PD patients without depression. \n\n\n#### Quality Assessment \n  \nWe assessed the quality of fMRI studies by criteria derived from the guidelines for reporting an fMRI study described by  . These criteria were aimed at ensuring that detailed descriptions of the methods and results are included in fMRI studies. The criteria consisted of nine domains, and their specifications are provided as Supplementary Date in  . Each study domain was scored at 0.5 or 1 point, and the points of all the domains were totaled; studies that scored \u22657.5 were considered good, those that scored 4\u20137.5 were considered fair and those that scored \u22644 were considered poor quality. Two researchers performed the quality assessment independently. When the scores of assessments were different between these two reviewers, a third researcher was invited to join the discussion until all three reviewers agreed with the score. \n\n\n#### Meta-Analysis \n  \nOur meta-analysis was conducted using signed differential mapping (SDM). SDM was a voxel-based meta-analysis that enables investigators to combine neuroimaging studies reporting peak coordinates. It uses peak coordinates to recreate a statistical parametric map of the effect size of the differences between PD patients with depression and PD patients without depression in each study and then performs a random-effects variance-weighted meta-analysis in each voxel ( ). In our meta-analysis, we used the default effect size version of signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) kernel size and thresholds (FWHM = 20 mm, voxel   p   = 0.005, peak height SDM-Z = 1, cluster extent = 10 voxels). \n\n\n#### Robustness Analysis \n  \nTo assess the robustness of the results, we first performed a heterogeneity analysis using a random effects model with Q statistics (  p   < 0.005) to determine whether there were significant unexplained variabilities between the study groups in the results. Then, we conducted jack-knife analysis (  p   < 0.005) by systematically repeating the meta-analyses after excluding one study at a time to test the replicability of the results in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n### Regions-of-Interests-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nTwenty-eight PD patients with depression and 25 age- and sex-matched PD patients without depression were recruited via the Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital completed this study. Patients with a diagnosis of PD from three neurologists according to the 2015 Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria ( ) were included in both groups. Participants in both groups were excluded using the following criteria: moderate to severe head tremor, functional motor disorder ( , ), cerebrovascular disorders, antiparkinsonian treatment with dopamine agonists, antidepressant treatment or other psychiatric therapy, and cognitive impairment as defined by an MMSE score <24. For the PD patients with depression, depression was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria by an experienced, board-certified psychiatrist trained to administer structured clinical interviews. This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Review Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. All procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. Every subject signed informed consent forms prior to participation. \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition \n  \nThe severity of clinical symptoms was assessed according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) rating scale ( ), and the motor part of the UPDRS ( ). H&Y score was calculated in anti-Parkinsonian medication OFF state. The severity of depression symptoms was assessed according to the HRSD ( ). The demographic and clinical data of the included participants are shown in  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects. \n    \nAll the fMRI were completed in resting state, that is, no task was performed by the participants during the MRI scan. Patients underwent resting state fMRI after an overnight withdrawal of anti-Parkinsonian medication. Images were acquired on 3 T SIEMENS MAGNETOM Prisma scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a 64-channel head coil. Structural 3D T1-weighted images were acquired with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time = 2,300 ms, echo time = 2.26 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, field of view = 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm, matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, number of slices = 186, voxel size = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm with no gap. Resting state data were acquired using an echo-planar imaging sequence with repetition time = 750 ms, echo time = 30 ms, number of slices = 64, flip angle = 54\u00b0, field of view = 222 mm \u00d7 222 mm, matrix size = 74 \u00d7 74, voxel size = 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm with no gap. Resting state scans were carried out in a scanning run of 6 min and 11 s. Prior to scanning, foam padding and headphones were placed on the subjects to limit head motion and reduce scanner noise, respectively; also, patients were instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax but not fall asleep, and move as little as possible during scanning. Criteria for head motion correction are included as Supplementary Notes 1 in  . \n\n\n#### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Analysis \n  \nFMRI data were preprocessed using Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit V1.24  (RESTplus V1.24) ( ). Data were first transformed into the NIFTI format, and the first 10 volumes were excluded for magnetization stabilization. The following steps were then performed: slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization using the EPI MNI template, 8-mm kernel smoothing, and scaling to a percentage change from the mean. Data were then bandpass filtered to no less than 0.01 Hz to reduce low-frequency drifts and entered into a general linear model to remove the effects of 24 degrees of motion and their derivatives, nuisance cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and global signal. No data were excluded because of excessive head motion. \n\nThe residual time series from this deconvolution was then used to calculate the MSE within each ROI. The ROIs were defined according to the results of our meta-analysis. Then, the MSE was used to quantify the complexity of each BOLD time series by calculating the entropies across five temporal scales. Greater averaged entropies reflected greater complexity. Specific calculation of MSE values and validation of the MSE results are included as Supplementary Notes 2 in   ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 25 software. Means, standard deviations (S.Ds.) and percentages of selected descriptive characteristics were calculated for the study sample. Independent two-sample t-tests were used to examine the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and MSE values in each ROI between the PD patients with depression and PD patients without depression. The significance level was set to   p   < 0.05 for all analyses. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-Analysis \n  \n#### Study Selection and Quality Assessment \n  \nAccording to the search strategy, we found 2,312 results, and 1,789 articles remained after removing duplicates. Then, we excluded 1,783 articles on the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The details are shown in  . Finally, six studies involving 126 PD patients with depression and 153 PD patients without depression were included in the meta-analysis. In these studies, age and sex were matched in two groups. The demographic and clinical characteristics including UPDRS, HRDS, and MMSE as well as imaging information of the included and excluded studies are provided in   and  . \n  \nStudy selection flow chart, performed according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. \n    \nDemographic characteristics and experimental design of the included studies. \n    \nDuring the quality assessment, three studies in our meta-analysis were classified as good, and the other three studies were deemed fair. The most common reasons for a deduction from the score were (1) the authors did not describe the inclusion or exclusion criteria of the study, (2) the authors did not specify how regions of interest were determined, (3) the authors did not describe detailed quality control measures, and (4) no slice coordinates were given for the figures. However, all of the studies in our meta-analysis scored above six, which meant that their quality reached an acceptable level. The specification of the quality assessment is presented Supplementary Date in  . We described the experimental design of the included studies in  . \n\n\n#### Differences of Neural Activity Between the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Patients With Depression and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Patients Without Depression \n  \nThe meta-analysis for differences between activation in the PD patients with depression and PD patients without depression yielded significant convergence of activation in the left posterior cingulate gyrus (peak MNI:   X   = 0,   Y   = \u201342,   Z   = 26; voxels = 1,966) and right SMA (peak MNI:   X   = 6,   Y   = 8,   Z   = 52; voxels = 1,008) (PD patients with depression > PD patients without depression). On the other hand, a significant difference was also found in the left cerebellar hemispheric lobule (peak MNI:   X   = \u201314,   Y   = \u201368,   Z   = \u201316; voxels = 2,011) (PD patients with depression <PD patients without depression) (  and  ). \n  \nClusters of voxels with significant intergroup activation differences. \n      \nStatistically significant effects of meta-analysis for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients with depression vs. PD patients without depression.

Increased activity in PD patients with depression is indicated in yellow and decreased activity in blue. \n  \n\n#### Robustness Analysis \n  \nHeterogeneity analysis from SDM showed that there was noteworthy between-study heterogeneity in Brodmann area (BA) 23, the SMA (BA 46), the middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), the cerebellum hemispheric lobule-VI (BA 19), the inferior frontal gyrus\u2013orbital part (BA 47), the corpus callosum and the inferior frontal gyrus\u2013opercular part ( ). Jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that abnormal activity in the cingulate gyrus was the most robust result. Other regions, including the SMA and cerebellum, were not robust in the meta-analysis, as they showed poor replicability of the peak coordinate ( ). Since the number of included studies was less than 10, Egger\u2019s test would not provide reliable results and was not performed. \n\n\n\n### Regions-of-Interests-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the 53 participants (28 PD patients with depression and 25 PD patients without depression) are presented in  . No significant differences in these characteristics were observed between the two groups. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, three clusters were identified as ROIs: the cingulate gyrus (peak MNI:   X   = 0,   Y   = \u201342,   Z   = 26; voxels = 1,966), SMA (peak MNI:   X   = 6,   Y   = 8,   Z   = 52; voxels = 1,008), and cerebellum (peak MNI:   X   = \u201314,   Y   = \u201368,   Z   = \u201316; voxels = 2,011). We observed that compared to the PD patients without depression, in the group of PD patients with depression, MSE of BOLD decreased significantly in the posterior cingulate gyrus (No depression vs. Depression = 1.16 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 1.12 \u00b1 0.07,   F   = 0.856,   p   = 0.045), SMA (No depression vs. Depression = 1.13 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 1.10 \u00b1 0.05,   F   = 0.914,   p   = 0.039), and cerebellum (No depression vs. Depression = 1.08 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 1.04 \u00b1 0.05,   F   = 0.227,   p   = 0.043) ( ), which was consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses. Except ROIs-based analysis, we also performed a whole-brain analysis, however, no positive result was found after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study aims to characterize the alterations in neural activity of brain regions in PD patients with depression. Using a coordination-based meta-analysis of publications in this field, we provide first-of-its-kind evidence that PD patients with depression had the most consistent abnormalities in the posterior cingulate gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. Then, to provide an independent validation of the meta-analysis results, we conducted an ROI-based analysis to measure the multiscale dynamics of these ROIs in PD patients with depression. All the patients didn\u2019t take antidepressant medication. The results showed that compared to that in PD patients without depression, the complexity in ROIs was significantly lower in PD patients with depression, confirming the results of the meta-analysis that spontaneous activity of the posterior cingulate gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum pertain to the pathogenesis of depression in PD; these areas may serve as targets for the management and therapeutic strategies of PD patients with depression. \n\nWe observed alterations in resting-state neural activities within the cingulate gyrus, which is consistent with previous studies ( ;  ;  ). The cingulate gyrus is a key region of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-limbic circuit, which has been linked to depression in both non-PD and PD cohorts ( ;  ). Neuroimaging evidence suggests that functional connectivity (FC) in this circuit is negatively correlated with depression severity ( ;  ), and increased FC between the PFC and cingulate gyrus is associated with depression-related gene orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) ( ).   for example, showed a potential pathological mechanism in which the inhibitory effects of the PFC on the limbic system, an important function in the regulation of mood, were impaired in people with depression. Taken together, the results here provided confirmatory evidence that alteration of the cingulate gyrus is a contributor to the pathophysiologic changes of PD patients with depression. \n\nSimilarly, alterations in the activities of the cerebellum were also observed in PD patients with depression. The cerebellum may participate in the processing of depression in PD via the cerebellar-cerebral circuit, which is formed by separate cerebellar subregions connected to distinct cerebral regions ( ). Dynamic FC in cerebellar-cerebral circuits decreased in depression patients, characterized by decreased connections of the cerebellar subregions with the default-mode, executive and affective-limbic networks ( ;  ). Decreased cerebellar-cerebral FC was proven to be correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms in PD patients, and it increased after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) ( ). Moreover,   demonstrated that this circuit could serve as a biomarker to distinguish depression patients from HCs, suggesting the important role of this circuit in depression. All these results support the important role of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of depression in PD. \n\nFurthermore, we found that PD patients with depression had abnormal neural activity in the SMA. The SMA is located in the medial posterior third of the superior frontal gyrus and is mainly concerned with the motor symptoms of PD, such as posture and gait ( ). Recently, converging evidence has suggested that the SMA also plays a critical role in the integration of affective and cognitive functions ( ). A PET study revealed that treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients were characterized by hypometabolism in the SMA ( ), and the symptoms of TRD patients were alleviated after the activity of SMA increased ( ). However, the related studies are limited ( ,  ). Therefore, the mechanism by which SMA is involved in PD patients with depression still needs further research. \n\nOf interest, all three regions indicated in our study showed altered function in depression patients as well ( ;  ). Given the similarities between PD patients with depression and depression, most treatment strategies are the same. However, there are still some differences among treatment strategies. For example, the dopamine-releasing agent methylphenidate was not able to improve the depressive symptoms of PD patients due to degeneration of the dopaminergic innervation of the limbic system ( ). In addition, most PD patients do not tolerate antipsychotics well because the dopamine-blocking action of these drugs contributes to PD symptoms ( ). For treatment-refractory depression, ECT leads to more adverse effects in PD patients than in purely depressed patients ( ). Thus, for the better treatment of PD patients with depression, it is of significance for us to further study its pathophysiologic basis. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. First, the meta-analysis was limited by the small number of studies and a relatively high level of heterogeneity in study characteristics. To get more data to support our study, we contacted all the corresponding authors of studies without whole brain results in papers. However, there was no response we can receive. As shown in  , different statistical or analysis methods, software packages and threshold settings were used in the included studies, which may influence our meta-analysis results. Therefore, our meta-analysis results must be interpreted cautiously. It is necessary to perform further subgroup analysis for studies with different measures, such as ALFF, ReHo, and DC. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of included articles, further subgroup analysis was not able to be performed. We suggest the validation of our findings through future studies consisting of an independent, methodologically homogeneous data set. Second, our study put together studies in which PD patients underwent fMRI in anti-Parkinsonian medication ON state and anti-Parkinsonian medication OFF state, this might be a potential confound on resting state fMRI signal. A subgroup analysis is needed to explore the effect of  -dopa on resting state fMRI signal. Third, the sample size of the PD patients with depression and PD patients without depression in our ROI-based fMRI study was relatively small. Therefore, fMRI studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our results of ROI-based analysis. Fourth, we performed the whole-brain analysis but no significant results were observed by passing FDR correction. This may be due to the relatively small sample size of participants. We totally agree that the whole-brain analysis in participants with much larger sample size will help confirm and expand the findings of the current ROI analysis, which are warranted in future studies. Finally, limited by the number of studies, we did not perform a meta-analysis on functional connectivity studies of PD patients with depression. Future studies are expected to provide a better understanding of the functional connectivity networks involved in PD patients with depression. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis revealed specific resting-state fMRI signal alterations in the cingulate gyrus, SMA and cerebellum in PD patients with depression. Our ROI-based fMRI analysis provided primary evidence that the complexity of neural activity was altered in the cingulate gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. These findings are helpful in unraveling pathophysiology of depression in PD, and they also have the potential to serve as neuroimage biomarkers as well as provide novel targets for neuromodulation treatment for PD patients with depression. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Review Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital.

Ethnic majority members, in turn, expressed biased responses toward minority (vs. majority) members in frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions that are known to be involved in e.g., facial processing, attention, and perspective-taking. We also found differences in neural response patterns toward different ethnic groups (White, Black, and Asian); broadest biases in neural response patterns were evident toward Black individuals (in non-Black individuals). Heterogeneity was mostly minor or low. \n\n\n## Discussion: \n  \nOverall, the findings increase understanding of neural processes involved in ethnicity perception and cognition as well as ethnic prejudices and discrimination. This meta-analysis provides explanations for previous behavioral reports on ethnic discrimination toward minority groups. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nEthnic inter-group bias refers to biased mental processing of ethnic in-group and out-group members. It can encompass in-group favoritism or out-group derogation, being either unconscious or conscious ( ;  ). In this way, inter-group bias is an adjacent concept to prejudices that are negative evaluations or emotional reactions toward an out-group member on the basis of preconceptions ( ). Inter-group bias has enormous societal significance by providing a psychological foundation for ethnic discrimination ( ). As the harmful impacts of ethnic discrimination are well-known ( ;  ), the European Union Charter of Fundamental rights has pointed out that \u201cany discrimination based on any ground such as \u2014 race, color, ethnic or social origin \u2014 shall be prohibited.\u201d Further, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (1998) has emphasized that international community must \u201cprotect effectively the human rights of all persons belonging to national or ethnic \u2014 minorities without any discrimination and in full equality.\u201d \n\nDespite discrimination-reduction efforts, ethnic discrimination has remained evident in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 1990\u20132015 ( ). A systematically replicated key finding has been that discrimination is not equally distributed among or toward all ethnic groups. In particular, Black and Hispanic employees are more likely to perceive racial discrimination than White employees ( ), and teachers have less positive expectations for African American than European American students ( ). Not only individual\u2019s ethnic group as such, but also individual\u2019s ethnic minority or majority status (i.e., the proportion of one\u2019s ethnic group in one\u2019s living region) plays a crucial role. When compared to ethnic majorities, ethnic minorities have substantially higher odds of encountering discrimination ( ), they need to send ca. 50% more applications to get invited to a job interview ( ), and they have higher risk of being charged or fully prosecuted ( ). Taken together, the current evidence indicates that certain ethnic groups and ethnic minorities are particularly susceptible to receiving negatively biased responses from other ethnicities. \n\nThis evidence has remained ignored, however, in the neuroscientific models of ethnic inter-group bias and prejudices. That is, the neuroscientific models on the topic have postulated a single model of neural responses toward ethnic in- and out-groups, without paying attention to the specific ethnic group in question, or ethnic minority or majority status ( ;  ). Thus, there is an urgent need to gain evidence whether distinct or overlapping brain regions are involved in inter-group bias among ethnic minority vs. majority members, and whether similar or different brain regions are involved in response to different ethnic groups. This was the aim of the present meta-analysis. \n\nTo date, two meta-analyses have examined ethnic inter-group biases in general, without taking into consideration possible differences between ethnic groups or between ethnic minorities and majorities. The meta-analyses showed that ethnic inter-group bias associates with activity patterns in the frontal cortex, insula, right superior temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and cerebellum ( ;  ). The findings were interpreted to reflect biases in attentional, perspective-taking, and emotional-prosodic processes toward ethnic out-groups ( ;  ). Although the meta-analyses provided crucially important pieces of neural evidence on ethnic inter-group bias, it was acknowledged that \u201cneural responding may vary depending on the specific racial groups involved (e.g., Black vs. White and Asian vs. Black)\u201d and that \u201cdistinguishing among various types of cross-race dyads is an important future direction\u201d ( ). \n\nWe conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to investigate blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to visually presented ethnic groups in healthy adults. In this study, we used the concept of \u201cethnic group\u201d to refer a group of individuals sharing distinctive outward physical characteristics (such as skin color or hair texture). More specifically, we investigated (1) whether ethnic minority and majority members have a neural inter-group bias toward each other and (2) whether various ethnic groups (i.e., White, Black, Asian) are processed in a biased way by the other ethnicities. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \n### 2.1. Literature search \n  \nThe Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) Checklist was followed throughout the meta-analysis. Moreover, most recent recommendations for a neuroimaging meta-analysis were followed through the process (when applicable) ( ). The literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science (17 January 2022). The search was directed to the fields of title and abstract, and we set no restrictions regarding publication date, language, number of citations, or publication status (see   for the search terms). \n\nA PRISMA flowchart on the article selection process can be found in  . After removing duplicates, all identified studies were screened on the basis of title and abstract and classified as eligible\/ineligible for this meta-analysis. Thereafter, the eligible full-text articles were screened more precisely on the basis of the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Besides of original studies, the reference lists of all meta-analyses and reviews (identified by the search terms) were manually checked for any additional eligible studies. In case some necessary information was missing, the authors of the original studies were contacted (  describes the studies about which we received additional details from the authors). Included studies are listed and described in  ,  . Literature search was conducted by AS (Ph.D in psychology; Ph.D in medicine; and Ph.D in educational sciences). In order to increase transparency of the literature search, we have provided additional descriptive information of the included studies in  ; the statistical contrasts selected from each study in  ; and the primary reasons for excluding articles in   (exclusion on the basis of title and abstract) and in   (exclusion on the basis of full-text version). Further, the full statistical data (e.g., all the coordinates and statistical estimates) can be requested from the corresponding author. \n  \nLiterature search process. \n  \n\n### 2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nWe had the following inclusion criteria: an original peer-reviewed fMRI article;   n   \u2265 10; adult sample (mean age > 18 years); a non-clinical sample (the subjects did not have any reported diseases or medications); a study design including exposure to ethnic in-group and out-group; a stimulus material including visual exposure to ethnic in-group and out-group members, including their faces (so that skin color could be approximately obtained); study design included face visual material of ethnic in-group and out-group (regardless whether the study topic was in\/out-group favoritism\/degoration or other ethnic perceptual or cognitive processing); the coordinates had been reported in the Talairach Atlas (Tal) or the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space;   T   or   Z   statistics or   p   values of the observed BOLD response toward ethnic in-group vs. out-group members were available; the study reported results of whole-brain analyses or analyses with very limited masking. More precisely, we did not include small-volume corrected results or region-of-interest (ROI) based results because a previous review recommended to only include studies with whole-brain results available ( ). We allowed masking if the study had proved that masking did not limit regions where significant in-group vs. out-group differences could be obtained; if masking was limited to regions (e.g., the brain stem or occipital lobe) that are not theoretically relevant in the context of inter-group bias; or if masking was limited to such brain regions that, in preliminary analyses, had been shown to correlate with the mental process under investigation (e.g., in-group vs. out-group contrast during facial processing was investigated in regions that were significant in face vs. non-face contrast). The exclusion criteria (mostly consisting of the opposite criteria to the inclusion criteria) can be found in  . \n\nData extraction is described in  . \n\n\n### 2.3. Meta-analyses \n  \nThe meta-analyses were conducted using the Seed-based   d   Mapping (SDM) software (version 6.21). Further meta-analytical details of the SDM software are available elsewhere ( ,  ;  ). \n\nDuring the data pre-processing, the lower and upper bounds of the possible effect-size values of the studies were estimated (full anisotropy = 1.0, full width at half maximum of Gaussian kernel = 20 mm, voxel size = 2 mm). Next, a mean analysis was conducted, representing the weighted mean difference in the fMRI activity (i.e., BOLD responses) toward in-group vs. out-group. There is evidence that sufficient statistical stability can be reached with 20 imputations ( ). To be on the safe side, we used 50 imputations. The statistical threshold consisted of an uncorrected voxel   p   value <0.005, cluster extent \u226510 voxels, and   SDM-Z   < 1, in accordance with previous recommendations ( ). Regarding other analytical details, we used the default settings of the SDM software that are described in other sources more precisely ( ,  ;  ). All the meta-analyses were adjusted for age and gender. \n\n#### 2.3.1. Main analysis \n  \nFirst, a main analysis was conducted where all the original datasets were included (regardless of ethnic minority\/majority status or ethnic in-group).   presents the contrasts that were selected from each study. In this analysis, we contrasted the BOLD responses to ethnic in-group vs. out-group in all the original samples. \n\n\n#### 2.3.2. Sub-group analyses separately in subjects with ethnic minority or majority status \n  \nNext, we examined neural inter-group bias separately (a) in subjects belonging to ethnic minorities (responses to ethnic minorities vs. majorities) and (b) in subjects belonging to ethnic majorities (responses to ethnic minorities vs. majorities). The analyses were adjusted for age and gender.   describes the studies included in these analyses; and   provides additional information on subjects\u2019 ethnic background. \n\nWhen classifying subjects\u2019 ethnic groups, we used similar classifications to those in the original studies: (1) Caucasian\/White\/European-American, (2) African\/African-American\/Black, or (3) Asian\/Chinese\/Korean. Subjects\u2019 ethnic majority or minority status was defined by cross-tabulating (1) subjects\u2019 ethnicity and (2) most recent statistical data available on ethnic minorities and majorities in the study country (e.g., the racial distribution in the US was checked from this source:  ). In general, the study countries had obvious minority\/majority groups; most common study countries were the US (ca. 76% White, 14% Black, 7% other ethnic groups) and China (ca. 91% Han Chinese, 9% other ethnic groups). The study country was defined on the basis of the following information: the region where the subjects were collected, the location of the institutional board for ethical permission, the location of the fMRI imaging device, or (if none of the previous details were available) from the country and region of the authors\u2019 affiliations. We excluded a study in case it included an ethnically heterogeneous sample (e.g., including both White, Black, and Asian subjects) and the results had not been reported separately within each ethnic group. \n\nThen, we conducted a sub-group meta-analysis   in ethnic majority members  . Specifically, we analyzed the contrast of BOLD responses to ethnic majority members (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic in-group, individuals coming from a same majority group) vs. BOLD responses to ethnic minority members (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic out-group, individuals coming from a minority that the study subjects did not belong to). Second, we conducted a corresponding sub-group analysis   in ethnic minority members  . That is, we analyzed the contrast of BOLD responses to ethnic minority members (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic in-group, individuals coming from a same minority than the study subjects) vs. BOLD responses to ethnic majority members (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic out-group, individuals coming from a majority that the study subjects did not belong to). In these analyses, we excluded studies that compared exposure to two different types of ethnic minorities (e.g., exposure to African-American vs. Japanese individuals in a sample living in the US).   presents the contrasts that were selected from each study. \n\n\n#### 2.3.3. Sub-group analyses separately toward White, Black, and Asian target individuals \n  \nHere, we examined whether various ethnic groups (i.e., White, Black, Asian) are processed in a biased way by the other ethnicities. The analyses were adjusted for age and gender.   presents the studies included in these analyses. \n\n(1) When examining inter-group bias toward White target individuals (i.e., White ethnicity constituted subjects\u2019 ethnic out-group), we included subjects with non-White ethnicity (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic in-group was Asian or Black ethnicity). Specifically, we contrasted the BOLD responses to White vs. non-White target individuals. (2) When examining inter-group bias toward Black target individuals (i.e., Black ethnicity composed subjects\u2019 ethnic out-group), we included subjects with non-Black ethnicity (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic in-group was Asian or White ethnicity). In this analysis, we contrasted the BOLD responses toward Black vs. non-Black target individuals. (3) When examining inter-group bias toward Asian target persons (i.e., Asian ethnicity composed subjects\u2019 ethnic out-group), we included subjects with non-Asian ethnicity (i.e., subjects\u2019 ethnic in-group was Black or White ethnicity). More specifically, we contrasted the BOLD responses toward Asian vs. non-Asian target individuals. The analyses were controlled for age and gender. \n\n\n#### 2.3.4. Heterogeneity and publication bias of the findings \n  \nIn order to investigate robustness of the results, heterogeneity was assessed using   I   statistics (i.e., the percentage of total variance between studies resulting from rather a heterogeneity than chance). We used the following interpretations of   I   values: low (<25%), moderate (>50%), and high (>75%). Additionally, the amount of publication bias was evaluated with the metabias tests ( ) and a graphical investigation of funnel plots. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Search results and descriptive information of the included studies \n  \nThe literature search process is illustrated in  . The literature search resulted in a total of 50 eligible original datasets that had been published between 2008\u20132021 and included altogether 1,211 subjects (  M   = 24.5 years, 50.1% female). There were 39 datasets with samples including majority members (  n   = 945,   M   = 24.1, 48.9% female, a total of 411 brain loci with significant differences in BOLD responses toward in- vs. out-group in the original studies); and 11 datasets with samples including minority members (  n   = 246,   M   = 26.2, 54.6% female, 51 loci). Additionally, we found altogether 21 datasets with White target individuals (  n   = 477,   M   = 23.8, 49.0% female, 89 loci); 21 datasets with Black target individuals (  n   = 557,   M   = 26.4, 48.0% female, 297 loci); and 8 datasets with Asian target individuals (  n   = 204,   M   = 32.8, 57.2% female, 89 loci). Most minority members were newly moved immigrants: they had been living only a short time in the country, and many of them were students of an abroad study program or had not had close contacts with the ethnic out-group before the study (see  ). \n\nFurther details about the included studies can be found in the  .   presents studies categorized on the basis of subjects\u2019 ethnic majority vs. minority status;   presents studies categorized on the basis of target individuals\u2019 ethnicity; and   includes additional descriptive information on subjects\u2019 ethnic background. \n\n\n### 3.2. Ethnic in-group bias: meta-analysis on all the eligible studies \n  \nFirst, we conducted a meta-analysis including all eligible studies. There was higher activity toward ethnic in-group in the left superior parietal gyrus (  x   = \u221222,   y   = \u221278,   z   = 46,   SDM-Z   = 3.263,   p   = 0.00055) and left median network (  x   = \u22126,   y   = \u221248,   z   = 28,   SDM-Z   = 2.787,   p   = 0.00266) when compared to ethnic out-group. No brain region exhibited the opposite activity pattern. There was not significant publication bias, as indicated by a visual inspection of the funnel plots (see  ) and the results of metabias tests (  p   = 0.998\u20130.994 for the peak voxels). Heterogeneity was minor in the left median network (  I   = 0.256) and low in the left superior parietal gyrus (  I   = 10.034). \n\n\n### 3.3. Meta-analyses on inter-group bias among ethnic minority and majority members \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Meta-analysis in ethnic majority members \n  \nNext, we conducted a meta-analysis on inter-group bias among ethnic majority members. Ethnic majority members showed higher activity toward ethnic majority members (vs. minority members) in the left superior parietal gyrus and in an undefined brain region (Brodmann area no. 30) (  and  ). Additionally, ethnic majority members had higher activity toward ethnic minority members (vs. majority members) in the right inferior frontal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right cuneus cortex, and right inferior temporal gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nNeural inter-group bias toward ethnic minority vs. majority members (a) among ethnic majority members and (b) among ethnic minority members. \n    \nThe results of the meta-analysis among ethnic majority members.

Meta-analysis in ethnic minority members \n  \nNext, we examined inter-group bias among ethnic minority members (toward ethnic minority vs. majority members). No brain region showed higher activity toward ethnic minority (vs. majority) members, or vice versa. That is, we did not obtain any neural inter-group bias among ethnic minority members. \n\n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-analyses on inter-group bias toward different ethnic groups \n  \n#### 3.4.1. Ethnic inter-group bias toward White (vs. non-White) target individuals \n  \nThen, we examined whether various ethnic groups (i.e., White, Black, Asian) are processed in a biased way by the other ethnicities. \n\nFirst, we conducted a meta-analysis on neural inter-group bias toward White (vs. non-White) target individuals in non-White study subjects (Black or Asian subjects). The findings are presented in  . We found lower activity toward White (than non-White) individuals in the left supplementary motor area, and right and left superior frontal gyri in non-White subjects (  and  ). No brain region showed the opposite activity pattern ( ). Heterogeneity was low in the left supplementary motor area (  I   = 10.613) and moderate in the right and left superior frontal gyri (  I   = 28.315 and   I   = 25.026, respectively). We found no significant publication bias in the funnel plots or metabias tests (  p   = 0.978\u20130.992 for the peak voxels) (see  ). \n  \nNeural inter-group bias (a) toward White (vs. non-White) target individuals, (b) toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals, and (c) toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) target individuals. \n      \n (A)   The brain regions with lower activity toward White (vs. non-White) target individuals (marked with red color).   (B)   The brain regions with lower activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals are marked with red color; and the brain regions with higher activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals are marked with blue color. \n  \n\n#### 3.4.2. Ethnic inter-group bias toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals \n  \nNext, we conducted a meta-analysis on neural inter-group bias toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals in non-Black study subjects (White or Asian subjects). There was lower activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals in the left anterior thalamic projections, left posterior cingulate gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus ( ). In addition, we found higher activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) target individuals in numerous brain regions, with largest clusters (>100 voxels) appearing in the right insula, left lingual gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus ( ). The findings are illustrated in  . \n\nHeterogeneity was minor in all the peak voxels (  I   = 0.535\u201311.377), except for the peak voxel of the left anterior thalamic projections where we obtained slightly higher but still low heterogeneity (  I   = 23.728). The metabias tests did not obtain any significant publication bias (  p   = 0.989\u20130.998 for all the peak voxels). The funnel plots are available in  . \n\n\n#### 3.4.3. Ethnic inter-group bias toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) target individuals \n  \nFinally, we conducted a meta-analysis on neural inter-group bias toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) target individuals in non-Asian study subjects (Black or White subjects). No brain region showed higher activity toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) target individuals, or vice versa. That is, we did not obtain any neural inter-group bias toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) target individuals. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \n### 4.1. A summary of the main findings \n  \nThis meta-analysis provided a novel perspective to the current literature by investigating the neural basis of ethnic inter-group bias (a) separately among ethnic minority and majority members (toward visually presented ethnic minority vs. majority members) and (b) separately toward visually presented Black, White, and Asian individuals. The pooled evidence from the original studies showed that, first, neural inter-group bias was non-evident in ethnic minority members but evident in ethnic majority members. Second, we found neural inter-group bias toward Black and White individuals but not toward Asian individuals in subjects not belonging to the respective ethnic group. Finally, heterogeneity was mostly minor or low in the brain regions related to inter-group bias, and the metabias tests did not identify any significant publication bias. In summary, this study showed that neural inter-group bias is differently expressed among ethnic minority vs. majority members, and toward different ethnic groups (White, Black, and Asian individuals). \n\n\n### 4.2. Neural inter-group bias in ethnic majority and minority members \n  \nWe did not find any neural inter-group bias in ethnic minority members: ethnic minority members did not show different responses to ethnic minority vs. majority members. Hence, in minority members, we obtained neither signs of out-group derogation (such as deactivation of perspective-taking-related brain regions when observing majority members); nor signs of anxiety or threat responses toward ethnic majority members. In the original studies, most minority members were newly moved immigrants: they had been living only a short time in the country, and many of them had not had close contacts with the ethnic out-group beforehand (see  ). It is possible that inter-group bias could be evident after spending a longer time period in a country as an ethnic minority member. Finally, it is necessary to consider that we had a smaller number of minority (than majority) members in this meta-analysis, providing a further possible explanation for the null results. \n\nThe fusiform gyrus showed more activity toward ethnic minority (vs. majority) members; and also toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals. The fusiform gyrus constitutes a face-specialized region ( ), shows activity in response to visual objects of expertise ( ), and responds sensitively to face color ( ). There is evidence from experimental studies and computational models that facial features, including ethnicity and race, are stored through previous experience in a multidimensional memory space that guides face perception ( ;  ): ethnic majority members may have developed \u201ca field of expertise\u201d of processing face of their own ethnic group. Related to this, we found that the left lingual gyrus showed more activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals. The left lingual gyrus is involved in working memory for schematic faces ( ), responds more strongly to faces than non-faces ( ), and exhibits higher reactivity to submissive than neutral faces ( ). This provides further evidence of biased responses to Black faces, and also arouses a cautious question whether Black faces are more easily interpreted as submissive than non-Black faces. \n\nOur meta-analysis showed higher activity toward ethnic minority (vs. majority) members in the right inferior frontal gyrus; and also higher activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals in the left median cingulate cortex. The right inferior frontal gyrus is a region of the emotional empathy network ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), and is also involved in executive functioning such as inhibitory control and attentional monitoring according to original studies ( ,  ;  ;  ) and meta-analyses ( ;  ). The left median cingulate cortex is a part of the mirror neuron system and involved in prosocial emotions ( ;  ). Consequently, these findings would support an interpretation that empathic responses might be stronger toward minority (vs. majority) members and toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals. \n\nOur results also showed, however, that observing Black (vs. non-Black) individuals correlates with higher activity of the right insula, which is commonly interpreted as a stronger disgust reaction ( ). Additionally, we found higher activity toward minority members (vs. majority) members and toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals in the right inferior temporal gyrus, which is found to show activation when one overestimates his\/her capacity to express empathy for others ( ). This implies that majority members and non-Black (White or Asian) individuals may be prone to overestimate their empathic expressions toward minority members and Black individuals. Taken together, a very cautious interpretation might be that, toward Black and minority members, there may be a kind of spontaneous disgust reaction that may be compensated by activating the frontal empathy-related regions and an attempt to express empathy toward them. \n\nFinally, we did not find any inter-group bias in the subcortical regions (e.g., the amygdala), indicating that there may not be any threat-related reactions when observing ethnic majority or minority members. We found, however, that ethnic majority members showed higher activity toward ethnic majority (than minority) members in the left superior parietal gyrus. It is a part of the dorsal frontoparietal network that is thought to maintain a \u201csalience map\u201d and direct attention to such external stimuli that are salient on the basis of semantic knowledge ( ). Thus, a cautious interpretation might be that, when ethnic majority members have directed attention to majority members (compared to minority members), they may be more actively retaining semantic knowledge from their memory. \n\n\n### 4.3. Neural intergroup bias toward Asian, Black, and White target individuals \n  \nThe left superior frontal gyrus showed lower activity toward White (vs. non-White) individuals; and also higher activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals. Thus, the left superior frontal gyrus seemed to respond in opposite directions depending on the target individuals\u2019 ethnicity. In general, this brain region is thought to be involved in working memory, especially during high cognitive load and spatial processing ( ). Interestingly, higher activity of the left superior frontal gyrus also associates with social semantics ( ), stronger feelings of social punishment ( ), and higher social dominance in response to disgusting facial expressions ( ). Thus, our finding possibly implies that a non-Black observer may have stronger feelings of social punishment or disgust-related dominance when observing a Black individual, while those feelings may be less evident when observing a White individual. \n\nWe found biased responses toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals in the middle occipital gyrus that is involved in perception of visuospatial objects ( ), and in the postcentral gyrus is known to include the primary somatosensory cortex. Thus, both regions contribute to primary sensory processing. Interestingly, we also found biased reactivity to Black (vs. non-Black) individuals in the left anterior thalamic projections that constitute a link between the primary sensory regions and frontal cortex (where we also found biased responses) ( ). The thalamocortical projections play a role in sensory selection during divided attention ( ) and in maintaining frontal activity during working memory performance ( ). Hence, there seems to be biases in the neural mechanisms regulating attentional resources toward different ethnic groups. This attention-related interpretation was supported but that we also found lower activity toward Black (vs. non-Black) individuals in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. This region typically deactivates when concentrating on an external task and when sustaining a vigilant attentional state ( ). \n\nThere was lower activity toward White (vs. non-White) individuals in the left supplementary motor area (SMA). The SMA is involved in the preparation and execution of voluntary movements ( ). Thus, our finding may reflect biased motor responses, as most fMRI tasks of the original studies included pressing a button in response to ethnic groups. Additionally, the SMA is also in self-other distinction and empathic perspective-taking ( ). Thus, an alternative interpretation of our finding might be that White (vs. non-White) target individuals may arouse lower perspective-taking responses. \n\nWe found no signs of neural inter-group bias toward Asian (vs. non-Asian) individuals in subjects with non-Asian ethnicities. This is in accordance with some behavioral studies showing that Asian individuals encounter less racial discrimination in the UK labour market when compared to e.g., African individuals ( ); and Asian-Indians are more likely to encounter benevolent than hostile prejudice in the US ( ). Finally, we had fewer original datasets available when examining inter-group bias toward Asian individuals (than toward White or Black individuals). Overall, we conclude that the pooled results of the currently published original studies did not find evidence for a neural inter-group bias toward Asian individuals. \n\n\n### 4.4. Methodological considerations \n  \nDue to a lack of a sufficient number of original studies, this meta-analysis could not investigate neural inter-group biases between different ethnic minority groups, or inter-group biases toward Arabs, Middle Eastern individuals, or Latinos. Some pieces of evidence suggest that ethnic discrimination is more evident toward Arabs and Middle Eastern than Asian individuals ( ). Further, some single findings have supported the presence of inter-group biases between ethnic minorities, such as between Arab and Israeli groups in the US ( ). Thus, inter-group bias toward these ethnic groups remains an intriguing topic for future studies. \n\nIt is necessary to keep in mind that, the brain responses toward particular ethnicities (Black, White, Asian) may differ between individuals from different ethnic groups. In our analyses, it was not possible to examine brain responses toward White\/Black\/Asian individuals separately among White\/Black\/Asian individuals (due to limited number of studies in each category). Therefore, results per ethnicity might theoretically reflect the combination of activation clusters linked to the different ethnic out-groups. This remains a research question for future studies. \n\nIn all included studies, the fMRI tasks consisted of visual (including facial) processing of ethnic groups. Nevertheless, there was some degree of variation in the task content between single original studies: for example, whether the stimulus material included video clips or photographs; whether the stimulus material presented only faces (with neutral or painful expression) or also a body; and whether subjects were instructed to press a button on the basis of group membership or some other indicator (e.g., target individual\u2019s gender). As a result, each sub-group meta-analysis included a slightly different combination of different fMRI tasks. The fMRI task of each original study is described in  ,  . In order to increase comparability between the original studies, we included only studies with visual processing (excluded studies with merely auditory processing) and studies where the target individuals\u2019 skin color could be seen (excluded studies where target individuals\u2019 ethnic group was described only in a written statement). \n\nInter-group bias can encompass either in-group favoritism or out-group derogation. In this meta-analysis, however, it was not possible to certainly define whether the biased BOLD responses reflected either in-group favoritism or out-group derogation. This is because, first, most brain regions (e.g., the amygdala, frontal regions) are involved in both positive and negative emotions and may also process complex sociocognitive information. Second, when finding a significant difference (such as higher activity toward out- than in-group), it is not possible to deduce whether it refers to elevated activity to out-group or reduced activity to in-group. This is because the brain responses cannot be directly interpreted as reflecting changes in activity level (e.g., increased activity toward in-group vs. decreased activity toward out-group) but merely a difference in activity level. \n\nFinally, this meta-analysis was limited to non-clinical study samples with adult-aged subjects. The original datasets were approximately balanced by sex: ca. 48.0\u201357.2% were female in different analyses of this manuscript. A large proportion of the original samples consisted of young adults, with the mean age of 24.1\u201332.8 years in our meta-analyses. Consequently, our results cannot be directly generalized to low-educated groups, clinical populations, elderly, adolescents, or children. Inter-group bias may be less evident in children ( ), and more evident in low-educated groups as low educational level associates with a stronger need for ethnic distance ( ). \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nEthnic inter-group bias seems not to constitute a universal pattern of neural responses toward visually presented ethnic in-group and out-group. On the contrary, neural responses to ethnic groups depend on (i) one\u2019s own ethnic minority or majority status and (ii) the target individuals\u2019 ethnic background. Neural inter-group bias appears to be non-evident among ethnic minority members (e.g., no signs of majority-group derogation) but clearly visible among majority members in many brain regions (involved in, e.g., facial processing, attention, and perspective-taking). Moreover, this meta-analysis found evidence for distinct response patterns toward different ethnic groups (White, Black, or Asian) that may possibly reflect certain sociocultural norms and attitudes. Taken together, this meta-analysis provides novel understanding of the neural mechanisms beyond ethnic inter-group bias and ethnic prejudices. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

Executive function is an important high-level cognitive process and a function of flexible integration and cooperative operation of different cognitive processes to achieve a specific goal (Trossman et al.,  ). The executive function of MCI patients is significantly impaired, which is mainly reflected in planning ability, continuous attention, and other aspects (Trossman et al.,  ). Hence, executive function impairment is associated with severe and lasting progression to AD in MCI individuals compared to other cognitive impairment. As is well-known, the executive control network (ECN) in MCI, which is a wide range of brain regions responsible for executive function shows different changes in brain regions in different studies (Joshi et al.,  ). There is no doubt that studying the specific abnormal biomarkers of executive function is a necessity due to a lack of consistent results. \n\nResting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has superiority in detecting several neuropsychiatric disorders in which the changes in blood oxygen level signal intensity are considered an indirect tool associated with function in specific regions of the human brain (Wee et al.,  ). Current studies usually evaluate functional alterations in the ECN by the following methods in rsfMRI: (1) the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)\/fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), (2) regional homogeneity (ReHo), and (3) functional connectivity (FC). The ALFF and fALFF are methods that measure the amplitude of spontaneous regional brain activity by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in the low-frequency range. The fALFF method has been confirmed to be more sensitive compared with ALFF (Yang et al.,  ). Numerous studies indicate that the specific patterns of ALFF and fALFF provide insights into the mechanism in AD and MCI patients (Yang et al.,  ). ReHo is widely used in the study of various mental disorders and has been demonstrated to have a high test\u2013retest reliability in the study of the consistency of brain activity. A large amount of evidence shows a correlation between the ReHo value of abnormal brain areas and clinical symptoms (Luo et al.,  ). FC usually reflects the connectivity between brain regions to reveal whether there is connectivity disruption or compensation based on independent component analysis and seed point (Liu et al.,  ). All three methods have their own advantages in studying ECN in patients with MCI, but the results are unanimous. \n\nECN, mainly anchored in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobe, ventral prefrontal lobe, frontal insular cortex, and parietal lobe, has extensive connections with other regions (Wu et al.,  ). ECN plays an important role in the integration of sensory and memory information, the regulation of cognition and behavior, and the working memory process with the prefrontal lobe as its core (Petersen et al.,  ). A combined arterial spin labeling (ASL), perfusion, and rsfMRI study confirms that the brain regions in AD where cerebral blood flow and ALFF decrease predict a disruption in the ECN (Zheng et al.,  ). However, the lack of consistent results for specific alterations in ECN fail to provide specific imaging markers in predicting the transition from MCI to AD. Therefore, to explore the specific imaging markers in ECN is essential to determine if these early alterations will serve as sensitive predictors of clinical decline and, eventually, as markers of MCI progress to AD by summarizing previous studies. \n\nCurrently, the widely recognized resting state brain networks include the default mode network (DMN), ECN, salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network (DAN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and sensory-motor network (SMN, a combination of three originally separate RSNs that correspond to the primary auditory, primary visual, and somatomotor cortices) (Chen et al.,  ). The components of each network are partially overlapped with other networks, forming dynamic interactions, which is considered to be of great significance in behavioral function (Brier et al.,  ). There has been evidence of possible interactions between the ECN and other networks (Yuan B. et al.,  ). Cognitive decline or disease would result from the destruction of certain aspects of this connectivity network (Leech and Sharp,  ). As a result, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the known networks in MCI patients. \n\nAnatomical\/activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is an effective coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA), which avoids laboratory bias in quantifying consistent imaging findings across studies (Robinson et al.,  ). ALE has been used extensively in rsfMRI studies, and it is suggested that ALE may provide image-specific markers (Robinson et al.,  ). In total, each individual coordinate from each study that is presented as a 3-D Gaussian probability distribution. ALE maps were produced by combining the distributions from all the studies in which significance was determined by using the threshold of   p   < 0.05 (Doucet et al.,  ). This method was applied in the quantification of the location and extent of cerebellar changes across the main frontotemporal dementia and neuroimaging in Parkinson's disease dementia (Chen et al.,  ; Weil et al.,  ). Because it has been used extensively in degenerative diseases, it is reasonable to use it in MCI patients. To our knowledge, so far, it is rare that a meta-analysis is made on the functional specific alterations of the ECN in MCI patients. As a result, a quantitative meta-analysis of published neuroimaging studies using the ALE algorithm were conducted to provide an overview of the current literature on specific alterations of the ECN. \n\nHence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the specific functional alterations in the ECN more comprehensively and discuss the functional imaging-specific abnormal markers in ECN and its interaction with other networks in MCI by using three techniques. It was hypothesized that, in MCI, (1) the three indexes of the ECN would show the special imaging abnormal markers, and (2) these specific brain regions would exist abnormal interactions with other networks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and Study Selection \n  \nThe meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and recorded using the suggested checklist. \n\n#### Search Strategy \n  \nPubMed, Embase, and Web of science were thoroughly and systematically searched. Search keywords were as follows: (1) (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201cRESTING STATE\u201d [MeSH]) AND [\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH] AND \u201cExecutive Control\u201d [MeSH] AND \u201cFunctional connectivity\u201d]; (2) (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201cRESTING STATE\u201d [MeSH]) AND (\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH] AND \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d); and (3) (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201cRESTING STATE\u201d [MeSH]) AND \u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH] AND (\u201cfractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201camplitude of low frequency fluctuation\u201d) ( ). \n\nOnly publications in English were selected. A total of 271 specific articles were screened. The flowchart of the literature search and selection strategy is shown in  . \n  \nFlow of information through the different phases of a systematic review. \n  \n\n#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nAll articles related to rsfMRI investigations on MCI were included in our study. To make comparisons between healthy controls (HCs) and MCI, information about Talairach or the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) were required in these investigations. \n\nIf articles were based on other diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, et al. they were eliminated. We dropped secondary processing of literature, such as reviews and meta-analysis articles. Case studies without group-level statistics were excluded. Articles whose necessary data could not be obtained even after contacting the author\/s were excluded. Articles based on region of interest analysis were excluded. \n\n\n#### Data Extraction and Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo researchers conducted selection, data extraction, and cross-checks independently. A third reviewer participated in judgment when disagreements appeared of any kind. First, we selected articles related to ECN. Second, articles with respect to the abnormal functional network in the use of ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo were included. All the abnormal brain regions extracted from the articles were based on brain regions in the ECN included in the articles. \n\n\n\n### Data Analysis Procedures \n  \nComparing MCI with HCs, we separated the three different methods by decreasing and increasing and then calculated them on the software: increased ALFF\/ fALFF (  n   = 251; 19 foci); decreased ALFF\/fALFF (  n   = 414; 36 foci); increased ReHo (  n   = 222; 17 foci); decreased ReHo (  n   = 202; 18 foci); increased FC (  n   = 136; 19 foci); decreased FC (  n   = 76; 17 foci). \n\nAn ALE meta-analysis was conducted with a Java-based version of Ginger ALE 2.3.6 ( ) (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The aim of ALE was to assess the convergence of the difference between MCI and HC groups in terms of foci across studies. First, we used a text file to read foci data that are imported into the software (Eickhoff et al.,  ). A threshold at   p   < 0.05 using the false discovery rate (FDR) was set in ALE maps (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Last, the maps were covered into the MNI 152 template and viewed with Dpabi software ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search Results \n  \nThe study characteristics and results are summarized in  . \n  \nDemographic characteristics of the included studies. \n  \n\n### Meta-Analysis Results \n  \n#### Abnormal ALFF\/fALFF in MCI \n  \nCompared with HC, MCI patients showed increased ALFF\/fALFF in the right lingual gyrus (LING), right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL), right cerebellum anterior lobe (CAL), right precuneus (PCUN), right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) ( ,  ).

As expected, compared with HCs, the brain functional differences of MCI patients were observed in frontal regions, including mFG, IFG, SFG, and MFG, in addition to temporal regions, such as ITG, PHG, and MTG, as well as parietal regions, such as the PCC\/PCUN, IPL, PCL, and SPL. There was little difference in the occipital lobes among the groups except for a small cluster of LING. Additionally, differences were also found in several subcortical regions, such as the lentiform nucleus (LN) and anterior and posterior lobe of the cerebellum. \n\nIn summary, reviewing the results of this paper, the ECN involved in frontal and parietal regions showed a downward trend in MCI patients. Areas of the ECN that showed an upward trend are mainly in the occipital, temporal, and subcortical regions with a small portion also rising in the frontal and parietal regions, which may be the compensatory mechanism of the disruption of frontal and parietal lobes in MCI patients (Valera-Bermejo et al.,  ). It is also well-established that the frontal and parietal regions are crucial aspects of the ECN, which send rich sensory information not only for movement controls, but also for other cognitive abilities, especially in executive function (Roh et al.,  ). Although the results reveal an increase in the frontal and parietal regions, these discrepant findings may be related to the different stages of MCI (Cosentino et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Interactive Neural Network \n  \nThe neural networks interacting with ECN involve DMN, VN, and FPN. The cerebro-cerebellar loops also were affected. Further analyses were performed to estimate whether the co-activation patterns of these regions could be fully attributed to some recognized neural networks. \n\nThe co-activation patterns, driven by differences between MCI and HCs, involved bilateral PCC\/PCUN, right IPL, right PHG, and right MTG, which were mainly located in the DMN. The DMN is usually active when the individual is awake and resting, not focused on the outside world (Zhang et al.,  ). In contrast, when the individual is in the routine task experiment with external stimuli, the network was in the deactivated state (Zhang et al.,  ). Converging lines of evidence indicate that DMN, where \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) protein deposition tends to occur, is considered to play an important role in various cognitive functions (Esposito et al.,  ). It is well-known that DMN contributes to information processing related to motivation, emotion, learning, cognition, and memory (Nicholson et al.,  ). In the present results, decreased ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo in MCI were all jointly located in bilateral PCUN, which engage in executive function. In addition to the bilateral PCUN, the PCC, right PHG, and right MTG exhibit a significant decreased group difference. Recent research revealed that PCC and PCUN appeared to have the most structural and functional alterations in MCI patients (Fuchs et al.,  ). From the structural point of view, a study highlighted the association between PHG and gait parameters in MCI patients. There was a linear correlation between the decrease of hippocampal gray matter volume and the gait parameters representing executive function (Cosentino et al.,  ). The reason why most of the abnormal areas are in the right hemisphere is that adults' cognitive networks are biased (Katsel et al.,  ). However, the increased ALFF value in the PCUN and IPL, which may be evidence of a compensatory mechanism at different stages of disease (Simo et al.,  ). As reported, a compensatory mechanism in brain networks is common (Simo et al.,  ). \n\nDMN is involved with episodic memory (EM) in which deficits are a typical clinical symptom of MCI (Yuan B. et al.,  ). Previous studies demonstrate that overlapping brain regions between the EF and EM networks indeed exist and elaborate that the DMN and ECN are dynamically interactive and closely linked (Yuan B. et al.,  ). Additionally, patients with EF impairment can also simultaneously suffer from impaired EM. It has been proven that dysfunctional connectivity in the DMN may reflect the gradual decline from MCI to AD (Hojjati et al.,  ). As a result, the present findings in the DMN show the neural mechanisms related to the interaction between impaired EF and the DMN network in MCI patients in new sights. Focusing on these brain areas is beneficial to the later individualized intervention for AD progression. \n\nLING has the most significantly increased difference in terms of ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo. Alteration of ALFF\/fALFF also indicated an increase in ITG, and alteration of ReHo also indicated an increase in cuneus. However, decreased ReHo of cuneus was still revealed. If disturbed, LING, which is the important region of VN, fails to process visual function (Li et al.,  ). VN anatomy areas include LING, CUN, PCUN, middle occipital gyrus, and ITG (Li et al.,  ). Previous studies have elucidated that multiple integrations of SMN, VN, and the cognitive network coordinate with each other to provide the organism with the signals to perceive and respond to its surrounding environment (Xu et al.,  ). That is to say, impairments in any of these components will lead to cognitive impairment at the clinical level. \n\nIn the early stages of the disease, when defects occur in any of the DMN and ECN, the VN connection may increase as a compensation owing to the whole collaborative brain system. However, studies have shown that visual impairment does not necessarily occur when a pathway in the visual network is interrupted with the disease progressing (He et al.,  ). With multiple pathways impaired, patients may have problems with space, orientation, color, and size in visual areas, which further affect the executive function (He et al.,  ). Although our results show both a decrease and increase in cuneus, this suggests that cuneus is an area that is easily affected in cognitive impairment. Compensation and impairment are manifested at different stages of the disease (Simo et al.,  ). \n\nCompared with HCs, MCI groups exhibit decreased functional connectivity in SFG, mFG, MFG, IFG, and cingulate gyrus. The area of decreased ALFF\/fALFF in patients was as well as in cingulate gyrus. Increased key areas with ECN include MFG, SPL, PreCG, and IFG. These specific regions are located in the frontal-parietal cognitive\/attention network (involved in many cognitive tasks, cognitive control, learning and planning, etc.) (Margolis et al.,  ). Based on resting-state functional connectivity and graph theory analysis, a two-system model for cognitive control, including FPN and the cingulo-opercular network, is proposed as the commanders of the brain (Cignetti et al.,  ). More specifically, the two networks that are hypothesized to be responsible for a dual-system of top-down control involve the cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), premotor cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, IPL, medial frontal cortex, and superior portions of the parietal cortex (Cignetti et al.,  ). \n\nA randomized controlled trial pointed out that executive functions, including control of thoughts and actions, fine-tuning attention, and information acquisition and analysis, are regarded to be involved in the attentional network model (van Houdt et al.,  ). As the important node of FPN, SPL is connected with visual attention. Our results show a functional disconnection within a distributed FPN network and confirm that disconnection of the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus can also be detected in MCI, the early stage of AD. As we know, the frontal lobe is particularly advanced, involved in processing memory and emotion (Zhang et al.,  ). The anterior prefrontal cortex is a component gathered by IFG, SFG, MFG, and PreCG (Zhang et al.,  ). Current research confirms that the completion of executive function depends on the dynamic interaction between the prefrontal cortex and other cortical regions (Liang et al.,  ). In contrast, compensation coexists in MCI patients, which is the reason for the appearance of increasing frontal regions, especially in the early stage of AD. \n\nIn recent years, the role of the cerebellum in cognition has been gradually studied, especially in the collaborative management of cognitive functions within the brain. Posterior lobe lesions lead to cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), the typical characteristics of which involve deficits in executive function, linguistic learning, visual spatial processing, and regulation of affect (Wang et al.,  ). Previous studies demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment with cerebellar lesions might include abnormal fiber connections observed between the cerebellum and the functional areas of the cerebrum, particularly in the precuneus, cingulate gyrus, and frontal and temporal lobes (Schmahmann,  ). In the present study, increased ALFF\/fALFF in CPL and CAL were of certain important significance in the ECN. Considering the cerebro-cerebellar loops, it is reasonable to speculate that the increase of signal in the posterior cerebellum is a compensatory mechanism after the impairment of executive function in the MCI group (Schmahmann,  ). \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nAlthough we have achieved valuable results, some shortcomings still need mentioning. First, the study is limited due to the existence of heterogeneity, including different data sources, preprocessing protocols, statistical or imaging methods, and threshold settings, which may have affected our results in this study. However, heterogeneity differences in study characteristics are negligible with respect to the changes in neuroimaging, which is a result from multicenter studies (Pardoe et al.,  ). Second, the subgroup analysis based on the MCI refinement classification cannot be carried out because the number of articles is inadequate. Third, confounding factors, such as age and gender, are as well as the unavoidable limitations. \n\n\n## Clinical Implications \n  \nAlthough valuable clinical information is provided by a single study, it is essential to make quantitative neuroimaging analysis by summarizing the existing research results, which is helpful to consolidate our understanding of the pathophysiology of MCI. In terms of the significant overlapping regions, such as precuneus, cingulate gyrus, and lingual gyrus in ECN, it is no doubt that the findings of our article will provide new insight into cooperative interaction between ECN and other networks, which can be used as neural markers for disease improvement in different pathological states. TMS therapeutic target design and drug treatment will obtain a more objective basis. In a word, our results strongly reveal the imaging features of disease-specific brain area damage and lay the foundation for in-depth study of the pathogenesis of MCI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn the present study, we elucidate the evidence of special imaging biomarkers in the ECN and three abnormal neural networks whose core regions overlap in the ECN, including DMN, FPN network, cerebro-cerebellar loops, and interact with ECN with various methods of rsfMRI analysis. These findings provide evidence for further understanding the potential cerebral alterations in MCI. These meaningfully overlapping networks provide a new perspective for future selection of specific brain regions. However, further studies for classification of MCI among these networks are essential to explore the potential role of imaging as a biomarker for MCI. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nWX guided by XL and JC designed the study.

Nevertheless, the literature on this topic is characterised by a large heterogeneity of paradigms and methodological approaches that can undermine the reproducibility of the results. To explicitly test whether task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to systematically detect neurofunctional differences between different classes of DOC, and whether these differences are related with a specific category of cognitive tasks (either active or passive), we meta-analyzed 22 neuroimaging studies published between 2005 and 2017 using the Activation Likelihood Estimate method. The results showed that: (1) active and passive tasks rely on well-segregated patterns of activations; (2) both unresponsive wakeful syndrome and patients in minimally conscious state activated a large portion of the dorsal-attentional network; (3) shared activations between patients fell mainly in the passive activation map (7492 voxels), while only 48 voxels fell in a subcortical region of the active-map. Our results suggest that DOCs can be described along a continuum\u2014rather than as separated clinical categories\u2014and characterised by a widespread dysfunction of brain networks rather than by the impairment of a well functionally anatomically defined one. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSevere brain injuries can lead to Disorders of Consciousness (DOC), a variety of neurological conditions ranging from the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), previously known as vegetative state, to the Minimally Conscious State (MCS) [ , , ]. Diagnosis of DOC relies on the use of standard behavioural scales, such as the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) [ , ]. Specifically, the use of these standardised tools significantly ameliorated the reliability of the diagnosis in the clinical routine: up to the 41% of patients diagnosed as UWS, for example, could be actually classified as MCS when assessed by means of the CRS-R [ ]. This demonstrates that increasing the diagnostic power for DOC may relevantly improve prognosis and selection of treatments, and facilitate end-of-life decisions. Nevertheless, the reliability of behavioural scales strongly depends on the integrity of patients\u2019 brain systems for sensorimotor, attention, memory, and language functions, so that neuroimaging and electrophysiological tools are needed to allow and ameliorate the diagnosis in DOC patients. Indeed, these instruments may provide objective assessments of the residual brain activity, both at rest and during specific tasks, also in the absence of behavioural responses. Specifically, active and passive paradigms have been adopted to detect the patients\u2019 residual ability to generate meaningful neural activations in response to environmental stimuli in the context of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. A classic example of the distinction between active and passive tasks can be found in the study by Owen et al. [ ], in which neural responses to a passive sentence listening task were compared with neural responses to active mental imagery task. However, the neuroimaging studies published so far have only provided anecdotal results as, for the majority of the experiments, only small groups of patients have been investigated, without providing a comparison with healthy controls. Therefore, to support this interesting evidence, a systematic replication of the fMRI results that goes beyond the specific experimental settings and paradigms adopted by every single study is needed.  \n\nWe aimed at formally addressing this issue by meta-analysing the fMRI\/PET results available in the international literature with the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method initially developed by Turkeltaub et al. [ ], which represents one of the most adopted approaches for the quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging data. We searched for the brain areas associated with active and passive tasks in DOC patients classified as UWS and with MCS. We hypothesised that:   \nactive and passive tasks would share brain regions associated with low-level cognitive processing, e.g., auditory processing, while they should be anatomically segregated at the level of higher-order-associative cortices; \n  \nUWS and MCS patients would be characterised by the activation of dissociable neural networks. In particular, we expect that the dorsal-attentional network, responsible for externally directed cognitive processes, would be mainly recruited in MCSs; \n  \nUWS and MCS activations would overlap in regions associated with low-level cognitive tasks, i.e., with passive tasks mainly, while no signs of shared activations should be found in brain regions recruited during active tasks. \n  \n\n\n## 2. Experimental Section \n  \n### 2.1. Study Selection \n  \nOur meta-analysis is based on 22 fMRI studies published between 2005 and 2017 which investigated the residual neurofunctional activations in severely brain-damaged patients with DOC (either UWS (previously known as \u201cvegetative state\u201d) or MCS). Studies were selected by querying the following key words in PubMed ( ): \u201c  vegetative state   AND fMRI\u201d, \u201c  minimally conscious state   AND fMRI\u201d, \u201c  disorders of consciousness   AND fMRI\u201d; \u201c  vegetative state   AND PET\u201d, \u201c  minimally conscious state   AND PET\u201d, \u201c  disorders of consciousness   AND PET\u201d. Among all the retrieved records, we excluded duplicates and non-pertinent studies. We did not include, for example, studies using other techniques such as VBM or DTI, or studies on functional connectivity. The 22 imaging selected studies met the following criteria: (1) activation fMRI-PET paradigms; (2) no resting state fMRI; (3) only data emerging from classical massively univariate analyses; (4) reporting either the stereotactic coordinates, or the anatomical label of the activated region either in the radiological, or in the neurological convention according to the AAL [ ]. It is worth noting that in some cases this represented an issue; for example we had to exclude the study by Schiff et al. [ ] and Zhu et al. [ ] because they reported the coordinates in the Talairach system, but in a radiological convention. As a consequence, by flipping the coordinates along the y-axis (to obtain coordinates in neurological convention) and then transforming the TAL in MNI using the TAL2MNI function available in GingerALE, we ended up with a set of coordinates that did not correspond any longer to the set of activations reported in the original study. Finally, we also considered as inclusion criteria: (5) only patients diagnosed with either UWS or MCS; (6) reporting data of single patients. The entire selection procedure is shown in  , and the full list of screened records is available in the   (INCLUSION-EXCLUSION.xlsx). The main characteristics of the 22 selected experiments are reported in  . \n\nHere it is worth noting that in the selected studies, the data from different patients were not analysed with classical second-level random effects group techniques, but rather, the results were reported according to the classic multiple-single-subjects approach. Therefore, we created the input database to conform to this approach; in particular, we entered activation peaks for every single patient included in the study of interest, which showed significant neural activity in that specific region (the entire database is reported in the  ). Moreover, it is worth noting that in 11 studies, the authors did not explicitly report the stereotactic coordinates, but rather the anatomical label of the activated region. In these latter cases, we extracted from the Automatic Anatomical Labelling (AAL) [ ] a representative stereotactic coordinate (see   for more details). \n\nUsing this approach, we selected a pool of 537 foci of activation distributed as follows: 441 foci were related to passive tasks, while 96 emerged from active tasks; 297 represented activity in the UWS patients, 240 represented the residual neural activity in MCS patients. The distribution of the activation peaks is reported in  . \n\n\n### 2.2. Meta-Analytic Procedures \n  \nThe identification of the activations associated with active and passive tasks in DOCs were computed by means of the software GingerALE version 2.3.6 [ , , ]. In particular, before starting with the meta-analytic procedure, we transformed all the stereotactic coordinates to the same stereotactic space (the MNI space) and in the neurological convention. The overall database was divided to map (a) the activations associated with active and passive tasks, (b) the activations specific for each group of patients, i.e., UWS and MCS. Once obtained the 4 sets of MNI coordinates, we applied the following procedure to the neurofunctional data:   \nanatomical masking\u2014we applied a filtering of the coordinates using the \u201cless conservative\u201d mask available in the GingerALE software. After this procedure, 5\/441 peaks belonging to the passive tasks and 2\/96 belonging to the active tasks fell out of the mask. When running the analyses on the classes of patients, 1\/240 activation peak was excluded from the MCS, 6\/297 peaks were excluded from the UWS; therefore, the final overall number of foci was 523; \n  \ncreation of the ALE maps\u2014for this step we adopted a standard 6-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to model the Gaussian function around each single coordinate, according to the procedure reported in the methodological paper by Eickhoff [ ]; \n  \nthresholding procedure\u2014the ALE maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected in order to detect also the lowest level of activation across patients (for the sake of completeness, in the   we report also the results with the most conservative thresholding method available in the literature, i.e.,   p   < 0.05 FWE). \n  \n\nAs a final step, we obtained 4 ALE maps: one for the active tasks, one for the passive tasks, one for the UWS patients, one for the MCS. We then performed two different contrast analyses with the procedure implemented in GingerALE by contrasting active and passive tasks, as well as UWS and MCS. With this procedure, we were able to identify:   \nthe regions commonly activated by active and passive tasks (active\u2013passive conjunction map) as well as the regions mostly activated by one condition (i.e., active tasks) as compared with the other one (i.e., passive tasks) and vice versa\u2014these computations allowed us to test hypothesis 1; \n  \nthe regions commonly activated by UWS and MCS (UWS MCS conjunction map), as well as the regions mostly activated by one category of patients (i.e., MCS) as compared with the other one (i.e., UWS) and vice versa\u2014these computations allowed us to test hypotheses 2 and 3. \n  \n\nMoreover, as reported in hypothesis 2, we are expecting to find a significant overlap between the dorsal-attentional network and the MCS map, while UWS patients, being unresponsive to external stimuli, by definition, should not activate this network. To explicitly test this assumption, we extracted the dorsal-attentional uniformity map from the neurosynth toolbox ( ) by searching the term \u201cdorsal-attentional\u201d. The UWS and MCS ALE maps were binarised into VOIs using the software MRIcron [ ]. We then applied a standard intersection analysis to identify the regions of anatomical overlap between each category of patients and the dorsal-attentional network. The intersection results were saved as VOIs and overlapped to the AAL template. By means of the \u201cdescriptive option\u201d available in MRIcron we then performed a regional voxel count (as a consequence, all the results of the voxel-count analyses are re-scaled to 1 mm ). Finally, according to hypothesis 3, if UWS patients have a severer deficit of consciousness than MCS, then we should expect to find activations during passive tasks, on average, in both groups, while only MCS should manifest activations during active tasks. Accordingly, there might be a significant overlap between the UWS and MCS conjunction map, but this overlap should be located in areas associated with passive tasks only. To explicitly test this hypothesis, the UWS and MCS conjunction map was binarised into VOIs using the software MRIcron and overlapped with both the passive, and the active tasks ALE maps. Also, in this case we applied a classic voxel-count approach. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nThe detailed anatomical description of the results is reported in   and  , in what follows, we describe the main findings for every single effect of interest.\n   \nPassive Task ( ): from the set of passive task activation peaks, we found a significant effect in the orbital cortices (BA 47) and in the inferior frontal gyri (pars triangularis; BAs 46, 45), at the border with the middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), in the lateral temporal cortices as well in subcortical regions. In particular, the two subcortical clusters were located (i) between the amygdala, the globus pallidus on the right hemisphere, and (ii) between the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus of the left hemisphere; \n  \nActive Task ( ): from the pool of active task-related foci, significant clusters were found in the paracentral lobule (BAs 4 and 6), in the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), in the fusiform gyrus (BA 20), in the lingual gyrus (BA 19), in the middle occipital gyrus (BA 19), in the superior occipital gyrus (BA 18), and in the cuneus (BA 18) of both hemispheres. Concerning the left hemisphere, we found a significant effect in the superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), in the inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis (at the border with the middle frontal gyrus; BA 9), in the postcentral gyrus (BA 2), and in a left subcortical cluster located between the amygdala and the putamen nucleus. Moreover, we found a significant effect in the right middle frontal gyrus (BAs 8, 9, and 10); \n  \nPassive and Active task - conjunction and contrast analysis: the active and passive map ( ) was computed to explicitly test hypothesis 1. As clearly reported in  , the only brain region commonly activated by active and passive paradigm is the subcortical cluster located between the left amygdala and the putamen. Finally, the contrast analyses (  p   < 0.001 uncorrected) revealed a higher level of activation for the comparison \u201cactive > passive tasks\u201d in the left paracentral lobule (x = \u22126, y = \u221224, z = 68; BA 6); the reversed contrast, namely \u201cpassive > active tasks\u201d did not show any significant effect; \n  \nUnresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS;  ): the patients in UWS showed significant activations in the inferior frontal gyrus, both in the pars orbitalis (BA 47) and in the pars triangularis (45, and 46) extending to the border with the middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), in the supplementary motor area (SMA; BA 6), in the lateral temporal cortices, and the amygdala (BA 34) of both hemispheres. Furthermore, a significant effect was found at the subcortical level between the amygdala, the globus pallidus on the right hemisphere and between the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus of the left hemisphere; \n  \nMinimally Conscious State (MCS;  ): we found significant clusters of activations in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47), in the lateral temporal cortices, and in the fusiform gyrus (BA 20) of both hemispheres. Also, in this case, a significant effect was found at the subcortical level between the amygdala, the globus pallidus on the right hemisphere and between the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus of the left hemisphere. Furthermore, significant results emerged in the left inferior frontal gyrus at the border with the middle frontal gyrus (pars triangularis; BAs 9 and 45); \n  \nUWS and MCS patients\u2014conjunction and contrast analysis: the activations described across studies and shared by the two classes of patients were located in the orbital portions of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47), in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 41), and in the two subcortical clusters located around the amygdala of both hemispheres ( ). Furthermore, significant shared activations were found in the dorsal part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (at the border with the middle frontal gyrus; BAs 9 and 45), in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22), and in the right heschl gyrus (at the border with the insular cortex; BA 13). The between-groups contrast analyses did not show any significant result.  \n  \n\nThe results described at points \u201cd\u201d, \u201ce\u201d and \u201cf\u201d were computed to test hypothesis 2 and were further explored to describe the amount of overlap with the dorsal-attentional network. Contrary to our hypothesis, UWS patients activated part of the dorsal-attentional network, in particular at the level of the orbital portions of the inferior frontal gyrus, in the heschl gyrus, and in the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally, in the left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, in the left inferior frontal operculum, in the left SMA, in the left precentral gyrus, in the left middle temporal gyrus, and in the right rolandic operculum ( ). Similarly, the MCS patients showed significant clusters of activations within the dorsal-attentional network in the heschl gyrus, in the superior temporal gyrus, in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, in the left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, in the left frontal operculum, in the left precentral gyrus, in the left middle temporal gyrus, in the right orbital portion of the inferior frontal gyrus, and in the right rolandic operculum ( ). The distribution of the activated voxels within the dorsal-attentional network across the two categories of patients was different (Chi  = 242.03;   p   < 0.001\u2014Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 iterations).  \n\nFinally, to explicitly test hypothesis 3, we overlap the UWS and MCS maps, both with the passive and with the active maps. Interestingly, the majority of the brain regions reported in the UWS and MCS map belonged to the ALE map of the passive task (7492 out of the 7556 voxels belonged to the UWS and MCS map;  A), while only 48 out of the 7556 voxels included in the UWS and MCS map fell within the active task map; these voxels were located around the left amygdala ( B, blue cross). \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe clinical classification of DOC patients in UWS and MCS stems from the use of standardised scales, such as the CRS-R [ , ], which are based on the detection of behavioural signs such as purposeful motor responses. However, neuroimaging techniques combined with active paradigms could reveal signs of covert consciousness in unresponsive patients. Specifically, acquiring neuroimaging signals during active tasks may complement behavioural tools in assessing consciousness in DOC patients [ , ] in the clinical settings. \n\nWith this meta-analysis we (1) pooled the empirical efforts performed by different laboratories (2) to explicitly test three working hypotheses concerning the neurofunctional differences and commonalities between UWS and MCS patients engaged in active and passive tasks. In what follows we will discuss the results in the light of these working hypotheses. \n\n### 4.1. Active and Passive Task-Related Activations in DOC Patients \n  \nSeventeen out of the 22 studies included in this meta-analysis used only passive tasks; most of these studies adopted either a passive linguistic or an emotional stimulation. Only 3 studies adopted a purely active paradigm, while 2 reported activations both for active, both for passive tasks. We are aware that the imbalance in the raw data might have affected the results of our meta-analysis. Nevertheless, despite this clear imbalance, we found a higher number of activation clusters for active tasks than for passive tasks, although these latter covered a larger brain volume as a whole (brain volume in passive tasks: 16,520 mm ; brain volume in active tasks: 3336 mm , see  ), and with an anatomical distribution that appears to be consistent with our first working hypothesis: the active tasks induce a more widespread activation within the associative regions such as the dorsal PFC, the left inferior parietal and paracentral lobules, along with the medial structures of both the occipital and temporal lobes. Interestingly, when querying the Neurosynth toolbox with the stereotactic coordinates reported in   for active tasks, the local maxima of the cluster centred over the paracentral lobule was associated with the term motor imagery (posterior probability = 0.86) suggesting an engagement of cerebral regions involved in the active processing of mental representations.  \n\nOn the contrary, passive tasks were associated with a significant activation of the inferior frontal, of the superior and middle temporal cortices, i.e., with brain regions that are typically related with linguistic processing (14 out the 19 studies that used at least one passive task condition). Interestingly, the only cluster that, according to a formal contrast analysis, was commonly activated by active and passive tasks is located in a left subcortical region at the border between the amygdala and the putamen nucleus: a region that, according to the Neurosynth database, is associated with \u201cpictures\u201d processing (posterior probability = 0.75) and with \u201colfactory\u201d processing (posterior probability = 0.85). If one turns back to the input database, this brain regions was reported in the study by Nigri et al. [ ], in which an olfactory stimulation was used, in the study by Liang et al. [ ] (x = \u221224.6, y = \u22120.9, z = \u22127.26), in which a mental imagery task was adopted. To conclude, the results of our meta-analysis suggest that active and passive paradigms map, overall, a pool of dissociable brain regions, at least from the neurofunctional point of view with a unique \u201cconjunction point\u201d at the subcortical level. \n\n\n### 4.2. Are There Neurofunctional Markers of Consciousness Recovery in the dorsal-attentional Network? \n  \nAs clearly pointed out by Posner, \u201c  within neurology, consciousness often refers to a brain state in which the person is capable of responding to external events and relate them to the self. This state is closely associated with the concept of arousal and to the diurnal cycle of sleep and wake  \u201d [ ] (p. 1); moreover, often the term consciousness is associated with the construct \u201cattention\u201d, under the somehow simplistic assumption that, if one can guide his\/her attention toward an external stimulus, then he\/she must be conscious (but see also [ ] for examples of attention without consciousness). This skill is associated with the functions of the dorsal-attentional network, the network responsible for externally directed cognitive processes [ ], which mediates cognitive responses elicited by external stimuli. According to the clinical definition of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness syndrome\u201d   (\u201cpatients who show several clinical signs (hence the use of syndrome) of unresponsiveness (meaning they failed to show non-reflex behaviour or command following) in the presence of wakefulness (meaning they open their eyes spontaneously or upon stimulation)\u201d  ) by Laureys et al. [ ] (pp. 2\u20133), in these patients the manifestation of cognitive\/behavioural responses elicited by external stimuli should be significantly affected and hence, one could assume that the activity of the underlying neural network, i.e., the dorsal-attentional network, should be significantly reduced. On the contrary, in patients with minimal signs of consciousness recovery (i.e., in MCS patients), the neurofunctional activity of this network should be at least partially preserved. We wanted to explore whether UWS patients manifested a significant reduction of activation within the dorsal-attentional network when compared with MCS patients, and we found that results did not seem to support this hypothesis. At the global level (see   for more details), in fact, the empirical findings are in opposition with our hypothesis as the proportion of voxels stored in the UWS maps that fall within the dorsal-attentional (5.5%) is basically the same of the proportion of MCS-related activations within the same brain regions (5.9%; Chi  = 1.583,   p   = 0.208). \n\nNotwithstanding these similarities at the global level, the distribution of the data at the regional levels showed some interesting findings (see  ). While some regions of the DAN showed exactly the same activation extent between the two groups of patients (namely the left inferior orbital gyrus, the left rolandic operculum, the left precentral gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis), some other regions, like, for example, the left and right fusiform gyri, were exclusively activated by either MCSs or by UWS. \n\nTaken together, the results of our analysis do not support the idea that responding to external stimuli indicates the presence of \u201cconsciousness\u201d; rather, they suggest that the partial sparing of a specific network, such as the dorsal-attentional network, does not represent a sufficient condition to clinically preserve island of consciousness; neither is a necessary condition for classifying a patient as \u201cconscious\u201d. We agree that the definition of the conscious state is difficult, and it has also been conceptualised as the consequence of the interplay between different processes\/dimensions. For instance, Laureys [ ] suggested that the level of consciousness (ranging from \u201c  coma  \u201d to \u201c  conscious wakefulness  \u201d) depends on the interaction between the level of wakefulness and the level of awareness. Similarly, Dehaene et al. [ ] hypothesised that the interactions between bottom-up (i.e., stimulus strength) and top-down (i.e., attentional modulation) processes could determine the level of consciousness. More generally, Tononi and Koch suggested that consciousness requires that functionally specialised modules of the thalamocortical system interact rapidly and effectively [ ]. \n\nThese different processes\/dimensions should involve multiple neural networks. Future studies combining behavioural and neuroimaging techniques should test these hypotheses more systematically. However, our results support the idea proposed by Gaillard and colleagues: \u201c  rather than hoping for a putative unique marker (the neural correlate of consciousness), a more mature view of conscious processing should consider that it relates to a distributed pattern of brain activation that occurs at a specific level within a complex anatomical and functional architecture  \u201d [ ] (p. 0489). \n\n\n### 4.3. The Minimum State of the Brain: Shared Activations between UWS and MCS \n  \nPatients diagnosed with UWS are characterised by a complete unawareness of the self and of the environment, while patients in MCS manifest a variable degree of self and environmental awareness [ , , ]. Thus, the common clinical feature of these 2 classes of patients is a certain level of arousal maintenance, with responses to passive stimulations not necessarily associated with volition. Accordingly, we divided the available fMRI tasks into two well-segregated categories on the basis of the required patients\u2019 commitment to the task. In particular, we defined as active those tasks in which patients were explicitly required to perform a command following in the absence of passive external stimuli (apart from the command itself), while passive tasks were all those tasks in which patients received either auditory or visual stimuli without specific active-task instructions. This dichotomic classification allowed us not only to test their across-study neurofunctional differences, but also to look at what we could define as \u201cthe minimum state of the brain\u201d, i.e., the minimum set of brain regions that is commonly activated by UWS and MCS, and that should be found in regions associated with passive task and not with active task. We found that the set of perisylvian brain regions commonly activated by UWS and MCS belongs to the passive task-maps, while there are only minimal overlaps within the active network at the subcortical level. This set of brain regions may represent the neurofunctional correlates of the minimum state of the brain in DOC patients that emerged from coma. Moreover, the fact that the proportion of activation peaks reported for MCS patients in active task (24.16%, see   for more details) doubles the proportion of UWSs\u2019 activation peaks in the same category of tasks (12.79%, see   for more details) suggests that the UWS activations are mainly associated with passive response in perysilvian and sub-cortical regions, while MCS patients are able to recruit, at least in part, regions associated with mental imagery (neurosynth posterior probability = 0.7) and spatial navigation (neurosynth posterior probability = 0.8) such as the fusiform\/parahippocampal regions reported in  .  \n\nThe continuum between different conscious states has been widely discussed [ , ], and the cerebral activations of UWS have been explained as the result of either bottom-up processes [ ] or interpreted as the neurophysiological correlate of wakefulness without awareness [ ]. Conversely, MCS-specific activations in active tasks would reflect the involvement of either top-down processes [ ], or the correlate of a partial recovery of awareness [ ]. This could be particularly true if the shared activations in passive task by the two classes of patients would be limited to \u201clow-level\u201d cortical and subcortical regions. However, our patients did not share activations only in \u201clow-level\u201d cortical and subcortical regions, with the only exception being the primary cortical areas such as the heschl gyri. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the shared activation of higher-order cortices activated during passive task may derive from some level of inaccuracy either in the clinical classification of patients. To make a suggestive example, a patient in the study by Fernandez-Espejo et al. [ ] was retrospectively classified as being UWS on the basis of the clinical rating. Interestingly, 8 out of 13 activation peaks retrieved from this study were derived from this patient. Furthermore, the activation peaks extracted from the study by Liang et al. [ ] were derived from two patients who showed signs of consciousness, as also stated by the authors themselves (see [ ] clinical description in the  ). In the same vein, the UWS and MCS patients in the study by Nigri et al. [ ] manifested similar values at 5 out of the 6 subscales of the CRS-R; for example, in the auditory subscale, the mean rank in the group of UWS was 5.88, while MCS obtained 6.07 (Mann-Whitney U tests = 13.5,   p   = 0.9). The only significant between-groups difference was at the visual subscale in which the UWS patients obtained a mean rank of 2.88, while the MCS patients obtained 7.79 (Mann-Whitney U test = 1.5,   p   = 0.01). The problem of patients\u2019 misclassification is also more intriguing if one looks at the studies that contributed to the clusters located in SMA for UWSs (namely clusters 8 and 9 in  ). In particular, the cluster located in the in the left SMA (cluster 8,  ) included 1 activation peak from the study by Bekinschtein et al. [ ] and 4 coordinates from the study by Monti et al. [ ]. Interestingly, in the study by Monti et al. [ ], there was only a clinical classification of the patients, with a complete lack of standardised measures, such as the CRS-R, which would allow us to better appreciate their level of impairment. Meanwhile, cluster 9 (centred in the right SMA) included 1 activation peak from the study by Bekinschtein et al. [ ] and 3 activation peaks from Qin et al. [ ]. Interestingly, in this latter study, 2 out of the 7 UWS patients emerged from the vegetative state within 3 months after the fMRI session. The issue related to the fluctuation of the responsiveness in DOC patients was recently explored by Wannez et al. [ ]; in this recent paper, the authors suggest a minimum of 5 consecutive assessments with the CRS-R to obtain a reliable classification of the patients. \n\nTo conclude, these incongruencies suggest that DOC patients can be better described along a clinical continuum rather than according to independent clinical categories. This continuum seems to better correspond to a hierarchical model of consciousness with different physiological\/cognitive levels referring to specific neurofunctional networks. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion: Recommendations for Neuroimaging Studies of DOC Patients and Limitation of the Study \n  \nWhen approaching the effort of quantitatively reviewing a piece of scientific literature, several issues may arise. We want to conclude by reporting part of these issues and of the difficulties that we encountered in performing this meta-analysis with the aim of giving to the readers some suggestions that should be followed when reporting the results of neuroimaging data on DOC patients. \n\nThe first issue we encountered was related to the distinction between neurological and radiological conventions. Indeed, we found 12 out of 38 studies in which it was not explicitly stated whether the results reported either in the tables or in the figures were in radiological or in neurological convention. This represents an issue for coordinate-based meta-analyses, especially when the coordinates refer to another reference system (i.e., TAL instead of MNI), since once flipped along the y-axis, the correspondence between the MNI coordinates in the neurological convention and the original results (in TAL radiological convention) was not maintained. \n\nFurthermore, 11 out of the 22 selected studies reported only the anatomical labels of the activated brain regions (see  ) as the results are computed in a single-subject anatomical space, apart from [ , ]. In these cases, it would have been useful to report, at the very least, information about the volumetric extension of each regional activation, for example, in terms of activated voxels, as this additional information could have helped us, and future studies, in estimating the anatomical distribution of the task-related fMRI results in each single patient. As a final suggestion, it would be useful to create a shared open-access fMRI database to store, at least, the basic clinical standardised scales (such as the CRS), a volumetric T1 image, together with a resting-state fMRI, to promote data sharing and pooled data analyses that, in the long run, could contribute to a better neurofunctional characterisation of patients with disorders of consciousness after severe brain damage. \n\nAs a final remark, we would like to make some limitations of the study explicit:   \nThe GingerALE approach only permits the comparison of two categories and looking at their commonalities. This means that every other higher-order comparison, as well as comparisons with other maps (such as those extracted from Neurosynth) cannot be performed using an inferential approach. This is the reason we adopted a voxel-count approach for our intersection analyses. However, the readers should be aware that these analyses gave just information about the spatial extent (as expressed in terms of voxels) of anatomical overlap. \n  \nSome of the results reported here may be triggered by the specific set of experimental tasks implemented in the fMRI studies. Future meta-analyses should better evaluate task-specific effect in this literature. \n  \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6517954,"text_md5":"2033853fa7de8c0bd189ba808676f891","field_positions":{"authors":[0,113],"journal":[114,124],"publication_year":[126,130],"title":[141,219],"keywords":[233,308],"abstract":[321,1770],"body":[1779,35732]},"batch":1,"pmid":31014041,"doi":"10.3390\/jcm8040516","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6517954","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6517954"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6517954\">6517954<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6517954  Neuroimaging Studies on Disorders of Consciousness: A Meta-Analytic Evaluation"}

Beyond the core brain areas typically activated in pain empathy studies (insular and anterior cingulate cortices), the diversity of paradigms used may reveal secondary networks that subserve other more specific processes. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on pain empathy was conducted to obtain activation likelihood estimates along three factors and seven conditions: visual cues (body parts, facial expressions), visuospatial (first-person, thirdperson), and cognitive (self-, stimuli-, other-oriented tasks) perspectives. The core network was found across cues and perspectives, and common activation was observed in higher-order visual areas. Body-parts distinctly activated areas related with sensorimotor processing (superior and inferior parietal lobules, anterior insula) while facial expression distinctly involved the inferior frontal gyrus. Self- compared to other-perspective produced distinct activations in the left insula while stimulus- versus other-perspective produced distinctive responses in the inferior frontal and parietal lobules, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum. Pain empathy relies on a core network which is modulated by several secondary networks. The involvement of the latter seems to depend on the visual cues available and the observer's mental state that can be influenced by specific instructions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmpathy is a multidimensional construct supported by distinct yet interacting neural networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Researchers generally agree that empathy emerges from two major interacting components: an affective component and a cognitive component. The affective component of empathy, also labeled affective resonance ( ), affective empathy ( ;  ), experience sharing ( ) or affective sharing ( ), can be broadly defined as vicariously experiencing other peoples\u2019 sensorimotor states and emotions. The cognitive component of empathy, also known as cognitive empathy ( ), perspective taking ( ), self\/other distinction ( ) or mentalizing ( ), refers to the perspective of another person while maintaining a distinction between one\u2019s own emotional state and that of the other. Thus, empathy is proposed by many to stem from the combined effect of these components and relies on various regulation mechanisms ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe neural correlates of empathy have been explored through a variety of functional neuroimaging paradigms in the last 15\u00a0years. The findings of this growing literature generally support the dichotomy between the affective and cognitive components of empathy (e.g.  ;  ). On the one hand, tasks that aim to selectively engage the affective component of empathy are associated with several brain structures including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, temporal pole, precentral gyrus (PreCG; i.e. primary motor cortex) and postcentral gyrus [PosCG; i.e. the primary and secondary somatosensory (SS) cortices; see Figure 5 in  ]. These brain structures are also associated with attentional, emotional, motivational and sensorimotor processes ( ;  ;  ). On the other hand, tasks that rely more on the cognitive component of empathy engage brain structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and fusiform gyrus (see Figure 5 in  ). These structures are also associated with executive control, action representation, working memory and visuospatial processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally, tasks that engage the affective and the cognitive components of empathy have been associated with a common set of brain regions including the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), supplementary motor area (SMA), cingulate motor area, anterior insula (AI) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; see Figure 5 in  ). This suggests that there might be a core network that is recruited across different empathy tasks. Additionally, differences in tasks used to probe empathy that can stem from differences of instructions or stimuli can also be associated with distinct and secondary networks ( ;  ;  ). The latter could be coherent with the fact that tasks tap differently in the affective or cognitive component of empathy. \n\nParadigms illustrating other\u2019s pain (also termed vicarious pain, or more commonly referred to as pain empathy paradigms) are the most common method employed to examine neural networks underpinning empathy (for a discussion on the potential overinterpretation of the term empathy in such contexts, see  ). Typically, participants view static or dynamic visual stimuli of the limbs submitted to noxious stimulation (SS pain paradigms) or facial expressions of pain [emotional-communicative (EC) pain paradigms]. These various sensory and emotional visual stimuli may contribute to the differences found in the reported brain response across studies. For instance,   showed that viewing facial expressions of pain, compared to the limbs submitted to noxious stimulation, triggered more activity in the midline frontal and parietal and amygdala, while the opposite contrast yielded more activity in sensorimotor regions. A recent meta-analysis ( ) confirmed that EC pain paradigms are related to structures in the frontal [i.e. IFG, middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and PreCG], temporal [i.e. middle temporal gyrus (MTG), STG and fusiform gyrus] and occipital [i.e. inferior (IOG) and middle occipital gyrus (MOG)] lobes, in addition to subcortical and limbic structures such as the thalamus, putamen, AI, amygdala and the anterior cingulate. Another factor that varies in the use of stimuli across SS pain paradigms is the visuospatial orientation that is either from one\u2019s own (first-person) or from a protagonist\u2019s (third-person) perspective. First-person perspective (1PP), compared to third-person perspective (3PP), is related to higher and faster subjective evaluations of the other\u2019s pain and an increased modulation of brain activity in structures related to the affective component of empathy ( ;  ). Finally, different types of instructions with regard to the cognitive perspective to adopt when viewing the stimuli are used across pain empathy paradigms. Indeed, participants are usually instructed to adopt either a self-perspective (i.e. to feel a person\u2019s pain as if it was their own pain) or the other\u2019s perspective (i.e. to imagine or to evaluate a person\u2019s pain), or to focus on the stimulus without specific instruction about the perspective (i.e. to pay attention to the stimulus). For instance,   showed that adopting a self-perspective is associated with higher pain ratings and involves more brain activity associated with the affective component of empathy [i.e. the secondary SS cortex (SII), ACC and insula], whereas taking the other\u2019s perspective yielded specific increases in activation of structures related to the cognitive component of empathy (i.e. the PCC, precuneus and TPJ). \n\nDifferences in methodological choices (i.e. visual cues, visuospatial perspective, perspective-taking instructions) can influence the way the dimensions of empathy are solicited in participants and explain part of the variability across studies. However, very few studies have contrasted these conditions directly (e.g.  ;  ), and no study has previously tested all of these differences in methodology within the same study. Failure to contextualize results within such methodological variations can pave the way for misleading conclusions about between-study divergence ( ) or oversimplified interpretations of empathy processes ( ). It thus remains difficult to draw an integrative view of how visual cues, visuospatial perspective and perspective taking influence the brain response during pain empathy. Previous meta-analyses partly addressed this issue ( ;  ). For instance,   conducted an image-based meta-analysis that compared SS pain paradigms to abstract-cue paradigms (i.e. abstract symbols indicating that another person is receiving a noxious stimulus). Since this 2011 meta-analysis, the number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations on pain empathy has exploded, reaching more than 200 studies. Paradigms have consequently varied greatly in terms of visual stimuli and instructions used to solicit empathy. In a recent meta-analysis,   examined differences between paradigms using either stimuli of facial expressions of pain or noxious stimulations applied to a body limb and differences between paradigms that oriented the participant\u2019s perspective either toward the self (labeled perceptual\/affective paradigms) or the other (labeled cognitive\/evaluative paradigms). However, other methodological differences, such as visuospatial perspective, have not been addressed. In addition, results indicated that SS compared to EC pain paradigms were related distinctively to the bilateral MFG, the bilateral IPL and the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), whereas no specific region was found to be associated with the EC compared to the SS pain paradigms. This result is surprising given that several empirical studies (e.g.  ;  ), as well as qualitative reviews and theoretical papers (e.g.  ;  ;  ), support the functional dissociation between SS and EC pain cues during pain communication (e.g.  ) and empathy (e.g.  ). The unexpected finding could be explained by the definition of the different conditions, which are relatively broad and in which different constructs overlap. \n\nThe objectives of the current activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on pain empathy studies were 2-fold: first, to provide an up-to-date quantitative map of brain region and networks (the core network) involved in empathy for pain and, second, to address between-study methodological differences through a factorial- and theoretical-based framework (secondary networks). Between-study differences were systematically and quantitatively compared according to three factors and seven conditions that stem from the choice of methods for each included study. Importantly, these factors\/conditions can also be organized in terms of their reliance on the different components of empathy proposed in contemporary neurocognitive models: visual cues (body parts submitted to noxious stimulations and facial expressions of pain), visuospatial perspective (first-person visual perspective and third-person visual perspective) and cognitive perspective (self-, stimuli- and other-oriented tasks). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Studies and coordinates selection \n  \nTo select fMRI studies using pain empathy paradigms, a systematic literature search was conducted between the 5th and 31th of January 2018 inclusively. Articles were obtained through online databases without any timeline restriction. Selected keywords were \u2018pain\u2019 in conjunction with \u2018fMRI\u2019 or \u2018MRI\u2019 or \u2018magnetic resonance imaging\u2019 or \u2018Imaging\u2019 in conjunction with \u2018empathy\u2019 or \u2018empathic\u2019 or \u2018empathie\u2019 or \u2018facial expression\u2019 or \u2018vicarious\u2019. This initial search led to a total of 717 articles across PubMed (  n  \u00a0=\u2009245), Embase (  n  \u00a0=\u2009243), Medline (  n  \u00a0=\u2009119), PsychINFO (  n  \u00a0=\u200991) and CINAHL (  n  \u00a0=\u200919) databases. A preselection of articles was done based on title and abstract by the authors Josiane Jauniaux and Ali Khatibi independently. Only empirical fMRI studies assessing vicarious pain and\/or empathy published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Quantitative or qualitative reviews were excluded. A total of 193 potential studies were identified. \n\nThe identified studies were then independently inspected and counter-verified by authors Josiane Jauniaux and Ali Khatibi according to the following selection criteria: (i) studies using visual stimuli; (ii) studies on healthy populations; (iii) studies on clinical populations, health professionals, children, seniors and long-term mindfulness meditation practitioners reporting results from a control group separately; (iv) studies reporting MNI or Talairach coordinates; and (v) studies reporting results from regions of interest or whole-brain analysis. Studies that had first-hand pain, namely, studies applying nociceptive stimulations on participants and a pain empathy condition, but for which the pain empathy condition was not conducted simultaneously with the first-hand pain condition were also included. Studies using different conditions, for instance, showing pictures of individuals of different ethnicities, level of attractiveness or degree of familiarity, were considered as well. Studies using different conditions and\/or tasks, for example, induced hypnotic analgesia, exposing participants to violent video games and induced stress, were included. To reduce the number of potential confounding variables, studies that used complex visual scenes (e.g. complex social scenarios, sports situations, abstract cues) or auditory stimuli (e.g. narratives or sounds to indicate that pain was being administered) were excluded. Studies using paradigms to induce social exclusion or during which participants needed to inflict pain upon someone were also excluded. Finally, studies using the same original data set as a previous published paper were removed. In sum, a total of 94 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. See   for a full overview of the study selection process. \n  \nDiagram outlining the study selection process.   n  , number of studies or experiments;   n   [f], number of foci;   n   [p], number of participants. \n  \nAmong those, fMRI coordinates were extracted from only 84 studies. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria but did not report the results for the contrast of either vicarious pain > no pain or vicarious pain > baseline. The findings for three of these studies could be included after the authors agreed to provide the data from this contrast. The final sample included 86 studies; 95 experiments; 2283 participants, about 46% of whom were women (at least 1061 women; 4 studies did not report the women\/men ratio); and 1332 foci. Participants were all adults from the general population and were aged between 19 and 49 years (mean, 21.89 years; s.d.,\u00a02.96 years). Age and standard deviation averages were calculated based on the number of studies in which the age (73 studies) and standard deviation (63 studies) were reported and were weighted for the number of subjects in each study. Of these, not all studies reported standard deviation. Thus, the calculations are based on the available information. \n\nExperiments were categorized into three factors and seven conditions based on methodological variations and the processes involved. Two factors involved largely bottom-up (i.e. stimulus-driven) processes: visual cue and visuospatial perspective. The third factor engaged more top-down (i.e. instruction-driven and\/or task dependent) processes, namely, the self\/other cognitive perspective. For each of these factors, a set of corresponding conditions were identified, described in detail hereinafter. \n\nVisual cue refers to nature of the visual information available from the other\u2019s pain experience. Across paradigms, the visual cue presented is mainly SS (i.e. limbs exposed to noxious stimulations) or EC (i.e. social affective cues such as facial expressions of pain) in nature. Thus, the experiments were divided based on these two types of visual information forming two conditions. Some studies used both stimuli of the limbs in pain and facial expressions of pain within the same experimental condition in their experiment; these studies were taken into account in the general analysis for pain empathy but were not included in either the individual SS or EC condition. \n\nVisuospatial perspective refers to the spatial orientation of visual information, or the observer\u2019s point of view of the other\u2019s pain. Differences in visuospatial perspectives exist mainly across SS paradigms. Therefore, for this factor, only studies using SS paradigms were included. Stimulation of the limbs is generally presented from one\u2019s own perspective (1PP; 0\u201345\u00b0 angle) or a protagonist\u2019s perspective (3PP; 180\u00b0 angle). Thus, studies using an SS paradigm were divided based on these two visuospatial perspectives, leading to two conditions. Some studies used stimuli of the limbs presented from several visuospatial perspectives; these studies were included in the general analysis for pain empathy but were not added into the 1PP or 3PP condition. In the cases when researchers did not clearly report which visuospatial perspective was used for their stimuli, a short survey was sent to them in order to obtain this information (see   for more details). Following the authors\u2019 responses, 11 experiments were added to the factor visuospatial perspective. In total, 35 experiments were included in this factor. \n  \nList of references included in the meta-analysis and their corresponding factors and conditions \n    \nLastly, the self\/other cognitive perspective, which relates to the cognitive and effortful process of taking either the self perspective or the other\u2019s perspective, has been manipulated through explicit instructions across paradigms. Three conditions were identified for this factor, namely, the self-perspective [self-oriented (SEO) tasks], the other perspective [other-oriented (OTO) tasks], or the neutral perspective [stimuli-oriented (STO) tasks]. More precisely, studies for which an instruction was given to the participants who oriented their attention toward a self-perspective were included in the SEO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to rate\/evaluate\/judge how they (the\nparticipants) felt empathic for the person, to share the emotional feelings of the person, to empathize with the person, to experience the feeling of the person, to indicate if they experience pain while viewing the person in pain or to explicitly take their own perspective. Studies using a photo cue (an image of the participant) to instruct the participants to adopt their perspective were also included in the SEO condition. Studies for which an instruction was given to the participants who oriented their attention toward the other perspective were included in the OTO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to rate\/evaluate\/judge the perceived unpleasantness and\/or the intensity of the other\u2019s pain, to evaluate if the person was suffering from pain or not, to put themselves into the other\u2019s perspective, to imagine how the person feels, to imagine the emotions of the person or to put themselves into the perspective of an observer. Studies using a photo cue (a photo of a stranger) to indicate to the participants to adopt another perspective were also included in the OTO condition. Finally, studies for which an instruction was provided to the participants who oriented their attention toward the stimuli were included in the STO condition. The instructions could be as follows: to view the stimuli attentively, to passively view the stimuli, to carefully look at the stimuli, to watch the stimuli, to pay attention to the stimuli and then, in some cases, to press on a button when viewing the fixation cross. In some studies, the instruction given to the participants were not clearly reported. These studies were not included in any of the specific self\/other cognitive perspective conditions but were taken into account in the general pain empathy analysis. Some researchers have used visual stimuli of the limbs and\/or facial expressions of pain while using different instructions in their studies. In order to reduce the heterogeneity across studies included in the factor self\/other cognitive perspective and to better isolate the effect of the cognitive perspective, at first, only studies using an SS paradigm were included in this factor. Then, analyses were carried out a second time, adding studies using an EC paradigm in order to examine whether the introduction of visual stimuli of facial expressions of pain would change the pattern of results. \n\n reports all studies included in the meta-analysis and their corresponding conditions.   reports the number of experiments, participants and foci by factors and conditions. See   for more methodological details regarding each study. \n  \nDescription of the sample: number of selected studies, experiments, foci and participants in each factor and their associated conditions \n  \nThe number in parentheses refers to the number of studies, experiments, foci and participants; included studies are those that used SS and EC pain paradigms for the self\/other pain cognitive perspective taking factor. \n  \n\n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis: ALE \n  \nThe ALE method used in this study consists of modeling the uncertainty in localization of activation foci using Gaussian probability density distributions ( ,  ). Gaussian distributions quantitatively adjust for the spatial uncertainty resulting from between-participant and between-template variance of the neuroimaging foci in order to model the coordinates ( ). The width of these Gaussian functions is computed based on the number of participants in each experiment ( ). The resulting ALE value is an estimate of the probability that at least one of the foci in the studies coordinates is truly located at a given voxel value ( ). For more details about methodological procedures to compute ALE analyses, see the   User Manuel for Ginger ALE   ( ). \n\nFor the current study, the coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the latest version of the GingerAle software (version 2.3.6) available on the BrainMap web site ( ) ( ). From the selected studies, stereotactic coordinates from the main effect of vicarious pain > no pain or vicarious pain > baseline, independently from other variables (i.e. effect of a task, condition or group), were extracted and were used in order to conduct a general ALE map for all experiments (i.e. global pain empathy map). Due to the very small number of studies reporting decreases in activation (i.e. negative blood oxygen level-dependant contrasts), only increases in activation across and between studies were examined, and deactivation responses were excluded. Coordinates originally reported in Talairach space were converted to the MNI space using the Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation ( ;  ) implemented in Ginger ALE. It should be noted that the conventional terminology of the ALE method was used in this paper: the word \u2018experiment\u2019 refers to a single experimental contrast analysis, whereas the term \u2018study\u2019 refers to an empirical article reporting one or more experiments. \n\nConjunction and subtraction analyses were then conducted. To do so, pooled ALE maps were computed. A pooled map was generated for the visual cue factor by merging SS with EC conditions data sets. A pooled map was generated for the visuospatial perspective by merging 1PP with 3PP conditions data sets. Three pooled maps were generated for the self\/other cognitive perspective by merging the following conditions: SEO with OTO, SEO with STO and OTO with STO. These pooled maps were computed a second time by adding studies using an EC paradigm. The following conjunction and subtraction analyses were performed for each factor:\n   \nVisual cue \n  \nSS   \u2229   EC \n  \nSS\u2009>\u2009EC \n  \nEC\u2009>\u2009SS \n    \nVisuospatial perspective \n  \n1PP   \u2229   3PP \n  \n1PP\u2009>\u20093PP \n  \n3PP\u2009>\u20091PP \n    \nSelf\/other cognitive perspective taking \n  \nSEO   \u2229   STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSTO\u2009>\u2009SEO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO   \u2229   STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSTO\u2009>\u2009OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO   \u2229   OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nSEO\u2009>\u2009OTO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n  \nOTO\u2009>\u2009STO (with and without studies using an EC paradigm) \n    \n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the cluster-level inference ( ,  ). A cluster-forming threshold of an uncorrected   P   value of 0.001 and a cluster-level inference threshold of 0.05 (permutation test) were applied for each factor (i.e. each pooled map) and for each of the seven conditions (i.e. each single ALE map). Contrasts and conjunction analyses were run with an uncorrected   P   value of 0.001 at first and then with a voxel-wise false discovery rates (FDRpNs) of 0.05 and 0.01 as the cluster-forming threshold to improve sensitivity to strong but focal activation. For all these analysis, a large mask size and the random-effect Turkeltaub nonadditive method were applied to minimize within-experiment and within-group effects ( ). Images were created using MRIcron software ( ). Broadman areas were determined using XJView ( ) from the coordinates found in the result files provided by the GingerAle software. \n  \nActivation likelihood clusters across all pain empathy experiments for the pain > no pain condition.

Regions consistently activated included frontal brain areas, including the IFG bilaterally (BA 44\/45, extending dorsally to BA9 in the left hemisphere; BA 44 extending dorsally to BA6 in the right hemisphere), the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; the SMA) and the left aMCC. In the parietal lobes, the following regions were consistently activated across all pain empathy experiments: the bilateral IPL (anterior\/dorsal to the TPJ) and the right SPL. Activation was also observed in the AI, posterior insula (PI) and fusiform gyrus bilaterally, and the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Subcortical regions including the thalamus, the amygdala and the lentiform nucleus\/striatum also showed consistent activation across pain empathy experiments. Finally, activations were found in temporal\u2013occipital regions, such as the left IOG, inferior temporal gyrus [ITG; in the extrastriate body area (EBA)\/occipital face area (OFA)] and the right MOG. Results are shown in  , and coordinates for all peak activations and ALE values are reported in  . \n\n\n### Visual cues \n  \nThe ALE map for SS alone showed significant clusters in the following regions: bilateral AI, MFG, PreCG, IFG, MOG, claustrum and thalamus; left ACC, aMCC, IPL, IOG, SFG, claustrum and putamen; and right PosCG, SPL, lateral globus pallidus (LGP) and fusiform gyrus (see   and   in   for peak activation coordinates and ALE values). The ALE map for EC alone showed significant clusters of activation in the bilateral IFG and ITG, left thalamus (ventral anterior and ventral lateral nucleus), AI, ACC, amygdala and right MTG (see  ; peak coordinates and ALE values are reported in  ). The conjunction analysis for SS and EC revealed consistent activity in the bilateral AI, bilateral ITG (EBA\/OFA) and left ACC. The subtraction analysis showed activations for SS compared to EC in the bilateral IPL, SPL and AI\/claustrum, left PI, and right PosCG and precuneus. The IFG was activated bilaterally for EC compared to SS (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). In summary, SS and EC pain paradigms were related to common [i.e. left ACC, bilateral AI and ITG (EBA\/OFA, BA37)] and distinct [i.e. SS: bilateral IPL (BA40), AI and SPL (BA7); EC: bilateral IFG (BA44\/45)] activations. \n\n\n### Visuospatial perspective \n  \nThe ALE single map for 1PP yielded convergence of increased activity in the bilateral IPL and SPL, right PI, IFG, claustrum, MFG, PreCG and MOG, and left AI, PreCG, ITG, aMCC\/ACC and putamen (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). The ALE single map for 3PP yielded consistent activations in the bilateral PosCG and left AI, ACC, MOG and IPL (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). Conjunction analysis for both perspectives revealed bilateral activity in the PosCG, left AI, ACC and IPL ( ). Subtraction analysis revealed no specific clusters for the 1PP (1PP\u2009>\u20093PP) or 3PP (3PP\u2009>\u20091PP; see   for the peak activation coordinates and ALE values). Overall, based on the ALE single maps, the 1PP and 3PP conditions showed a similar pattern of activations. However, the 1PP condition was associated with a greater extent of activations in structures related to the affective and cognitive components of empathy (i.e. bilateral SPL, right IPL, PI, SPL, IFG, claustrum, and MOG, left ITG and putamen). Both visuospatial perspectives commonly recruited structures implicated in the affective component of empathy and self\/other distinction (i.e. left AI, ACC, and IPL and bilateral PosCG). \n  \nActivation likelihood clusters for pain empathy experiments using SS or EC visual pain information during a pain > no pain condition.

Several clusters of activation were found for the SEO condition when studies using an EC paradigm were added, namely, the bilateral IPL and claustrum, and left AI, IFG, PreCG, aMCC, ACC and MFG. Refer to   in   for peak coordinates and ALE values. For the OTO condition, the single ALE map revealed consistent activation in the bilateral AI, IFG, MFG and fusiform gyrus; left PI, IPL, caudate head, ACC, claustrum and IOG; and right SPL, aMCC, culmen and PosCG (see   and   for peak coordinates and ALE values). When adding studies using an EC paradigm, the analysis revealed a similar pattern, but with more regions of activation. Specifically, in this analysis, the bilateral AI, IFG, SPL, SFG and IPL, left ACC, claustrum, and fusiform gyrus and right MOG, were recruited (see  ). For the STO condition, the single ALE map showed consistent activations in the bilateral IPL and additionally in the right PosCG and IOG, and left IFG, PreCG, ITG and fusiform (  and  ). When adding studies using an EC paradigm, several additional clusters were found, including in the bilateral IPL, left AI, ITG, IFG and claustrum, and right PosCG, IOG, fusiform gyrus and SFG (see   for peak coordinate and ALE values). \n\nWhen running the conjunction and subtraction analyses, results showed common and distinct patterns of activation for certain conditions. Conjunction analyses showed consistent activities in the bilateral IPL, left PreCG and right MOG for the SEO and STO ( ); the bilateral IPL and left ACC, AI, MFG, IFG and SFG for SEO and OTO ( ); and the bilateral IPL, left ITG, PreCG and fusiform, and right PosCG for the OTO and STO ( ). The contrast STO\u2009>\u2009OTO was associated with activations in the right IOG, cerebellum and IPL, and left PreCG and IFG ( ). Other contrasts did not show significant activation (i.e. SEO\u2009>\u2009STO, STO\u2009>\u2009SEO, OTO\u2009>\u2009SEO, SEO\u2009>\u2009OTO and OTO\u2009>\u2009STO; see   for peak coordinates and ALE values for each of these analyses). When adding studies using an EC paradigms in the analyses for the self\/other cognitive perspective factor, the conjunction analyses revealed consistent activity in the bilateral IPL, left PreCG, IFG and AI for the SEO and STO conditions; the bilateral IPL and left ACC, AI, claustrum, MFG and IFG for SEO and OTO conditions; and the bilateral IPL, left ITG, IFG and AI, and right PosCG and SFG for the OTO and STO conditions. The subtraction analysis STO\u2009>\u2009OTO was associated with consistent activation in the bilateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum, right IOG and SFG, and left IFG. The subtraction analysis SEO\u2009>\u2009OTO showed specific activations in the left AI for the SEO condition. Other contrasts did not show significant activations (i.e. SEO\u2009>\u2009STO, STO\u2009>\u2009SEO, OTO\u2009>\u2009SEO and OTO\u2009>\u2009STO).

Threshold for the conjunction and subtraction maps: cluster-forming   P  -uncorrected <0.001. \n  \nIn summary, based on the single ALE maps, results showed that other-oriented tasks were associated with a greater extent of activations in the core (i.e. left AI and right aMCC) and secondary (i.e. left MFG, right IFG, SPL and bilateral fusiform gyrus) brain networks related to pain empathy compared to self-oriented tasks. Other-oriented tasks were associated with a great extent of activation in the core (i.e. left AI\/ACC) and secondary (i.e. left MFG, right PosCG, IFG, SPL and fusiform gyrus) compared to stimuli-oriented tasks. Self-oriented tasks were associated with a greater extent of activations in the core (i.e. left AI) and secondary (i.e. IFG) networks compared to stimuli-oriented tasks. In addition, the three types of tasks were related to common activations in the bilateral IPL. Other- and self-oriented tasks commonly activated the left AI and ACC. Finally, distinct activations were found for stimuli- compared to other-oriented tasks in frontoparietal (i.e. right IPL and left PreCG and IFG) and occipital (right IOG) structures in addition to the cerebellum when considering only SS pain paradigms. Self- compared to other-oriented task was related to distinct activations in the left AI when considering both SS and EC pain paradigms. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe neural correlates of empathy and its components have been explored using a number of pain empathy paradigms involving different stimuli, instructions and tasks. Failure to consider the underlying processes and these methodological variations in the study of empathy oversimplifies the interpretation of neuroimaging studies and can give a misleading impression of the results obtained with these diverse experimental conditions. The objectives of the current work were to provide a general quantitative map of brain structures involved in empathy based on previous fMRI studies on pain empathy and to replicate how empathy may reveal a core network, as previously found ( ;  ). Moreover, it aimed to explore secondary networks in empathy which may depend on specific properties of the stimuli and tasks used across these different studies. At first, a general coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis on 95 fMRI pain empathy experiments was conducted. Studies were then categorized based on their methodological variations, leading to three factors and seven conditions: pain visual cues (i.e. body parts in noxious situations and facial expressions of pain), pain visuospatial perspectives (i.e. IPP and 3PP), and self\/other cognitive perspectives taking (i.e. self-, stimuli- and other-oriented tasks). ALE conjunction and subtraction analyses were carried out in order to investigate whether secondary networks could be related to these specific conditions. \n\n### Empathy and its related processes \n  \nIt is generally accepted that empathy is supported by two major components, an affective and a cognitive component ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The current research, which quantitatively synthesized almost a hundred fMRI experiments, supports this conceptualization, showing that pain observations recruit several structures throughout the brain networks associated with these empathy components. Indeed, the general analysis showed the engagement of frontal (i.e. IFG), parietal (i.e. SPL, IPL), sublobar (i.e. AI\/PI, thalamus), limbic (i.e. aMCC\/ACC, amygdala) and subcortical (i.e. cerebellum) structures, which are typically associated with the affective component of empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The study also showed activation of other parietal (i.e. IPL) and temporal (i.e. fusiform gyrus and ITG) structures, which are typically associated with the cognitive component of empathy ( ;  ;  ;  ). Although empathy can be divided into these two major components, more rudimentary processes may underlie these \u2018umbrellas components\u2019 ( ). The combined activation of the structures underlying these processes is likely to facilitate a fully empathic experience, as discussed hereinafter. \n  \nSignificant activation likelihood clusters for conjunctions and subtractions analyses for the self\/other cognitive perspective taking factor \n  \nHigher ALE values or   Z   scores are associated with greater probability of activation across experiments. \n    \nSignificant activation likelihood clusters for conjunctions and subtractions analyses for the self\/other cognitive perspective taking factor with studies using an SS or an EC paradigm \n  \nHigher ALE values or   Z   scores are associated with greater probability of activation across experiments. \n  \n#### An affective representation: at the core of pain empathy \n  \nThe current research shows that pain empathy relies on a core network of structures that include the AI and the aMCC\/ACC. These regions were found to be consistently recruited across a variety of pain paradigms. Similar to   meta-analysis, the present analysis reveals a large number of clusters relating to activation of the AI and aMCC\/ACC (69 and 49 clusters out of 95 related to the AI and aMCC\/ACC, respectively). In addition, the AI and aMCC\/ACC were consistently and commonly activated across different visual cues, visuospatial perspectives and self- and other-oriented perspective-taking instructions. These results also support those of other meta-analyses that found activation in the AI and aMCC\/ACC during empathy for non-pain-related conditions ( ;  ;  ) and for empathy for non-pain-negative affective states ( ). Activity in these structures has been suggested to be associated with the affective\/perceptual component of pain experience ( ;  ;  ), as well as with the affective-resonance component of empathy ( ;  ). Accordingly, our results of combined activation of the AI and aMCC\/ACC are in line with the hypothesis of a shared neural representation related to the affective component of pain. It should be noted, however, that the meta-analysis of  ) showed that the amygdala, the rostal ACC and the posterior cingulate cortex were also commonly activated across the selected studies, results that were not replicated in the present study. The coordinated-based meta-analysis of  ) differed from the current analysis in that it was conducted with paradigms that employed visual, textual or auditory stimuli of social interactions during which participants watched passively or evaluated various dimensions of the others\u2019 emotional states. Although results from this previous meta-analysis diverge partly from the current results, it appears that the AI and the aMCC\/ACC are consistently identified as part of what we call the core network of empathy. Additional structures may be recruited depending on the specific affective modality, visual information or perspective with which an observer is to empathize. \n\nAlthough the AI and the aMCC\/ACC are suggested to be at the basis of an affective shared neural representation during empathy, evidence from other research fields suggests that these structures are also implicated in a variety of other functions. Although the AI and the ACC have been consistently shown to be related to nociceptive stimulation, it was alternatively proposed to view these areas being part of a functional system involved in detecting, orienting attention toward and reacting to salient sensory events ( ). Indeed, a neuroimaging review ( ) and meta-analysis ( ) suggest that the insula is a key node of the \u2018salience network\u2019 relating to the capacity to detect relevant stimuli in the environment. Additionally, research shows that the AI contributes to interoceptive representations and subjective awareness of the body\u2019s various states ( ,  ). Moreover, in relation to pain, a large body of evidence shows a posterior\u2013anterior functional dissociation within the insula. The posterior parts of the insula are suggested to integrate nociceptive afferents ( ), encode pain intensity ( ;  ), and may be related to preconscious pain perception ( ). In contrast, the anterior parts of the insula are suggested to underpin evaluative aspects of pain sensation ( ;  ) and conscious voluntary reactions ( ). Furthermore, a review suggests a caudal\u2013anterior and lateralized functional organization of the insula for pain experience and pain observation ( ). Within the left insula, the caudal to the mid-areas would be more related to pain experience, whereas the anterior areas would be preferentially associated with pain empathy. Within the right insula, pain experience would be related to the full caudal\u2013anterior spectrum. The anterior areas would be associated only in part with pain empathy. Since our results showed consistent activation in the anterior and caudal insula\/PI bilaterally and more frequently in the AI, one may conclude that the insula cortices, in particular the anterior parts, may play an important role in detecting salient cues related to the other\u2019s pain in order to evoke a conscious interoceptive image of the other\u2019s pain sensation and intensity. \n\nAn ongoing debate challenges the previous assumptions about the specific function of the dorsal ACC (dACC) in pain ( ). A considerable body of evidence suggests that the dACC is responsive to pain ( ), pain empathy ( ) and both ( ). However, it would be misleading to say that this structure is   selective   to pain experience and\/or pain observation, as it is also responsive to viewing or experiencing negative emotions ( ) and other cognitive functions, such as attention ( ;  ), inhibition ( ), and language, motor, learning and memory ( ), to name only a few. However, neuroscientists seem to agree on one point: the dACC \u2018subserves survival-relevant functions\u2019 ( );  ). More precisely, the dACC has been linked to the attentional control that serves to regulate cognitive processes and to adjust our behaviors in accordance with internal goals ( ). Based on a large-scale quantitative analysis of fMRI data,  ) proposed that the dACC serves an alarm-like function for goal-related conflicts requiring attention. During pain, the role of the dACC may therefore be to integrate basic affective and cognitive processes in order to assign and organize, in an attentional control manner, other brain functions and behaviors to assure survival. In addition, several studies show that brain responses in the AI and the ACC correlate with prosocial behaviors ( ;  ;  ). Our study suggests that such processes might take part in pain empathy, as the dACC and the AI were consistently activated during pain empathy. Perhaps the AI and ACCs constitute a network that, firstly, allows an internal, somatovisceral and conscious representation of the other\u2019s pain and, secondly, coordinates other brain functions to select adaptive behaviors such as empathic responses and prosocial behaviors. \n\n\n#### A somatosensorimotor representation \n  \nThe discovery of mirror neurons located in the ventral premotor cortex (F5) in nonhuman primates ( ) prompted affective and social neuroscientists to propose the perception\u2013action hypothesis, which stipulates that the perception of others\u2019 actions automatically activates the observer\u2019s brain representations of these actions ( ). More specifically, according to this hypothesis, a \u2018mirror mechanism would be at the basis of brain mechanisms that transform sensory representations of others\u2019 behaviour into one\u2019s own motor or visceromotor representations concerning that behaviour\u2019 ( ). Indeed, substantial evidence shows that observation of others\u2019 actions is related to a network of cortical structures typically activated when executing those actions in human (see  ;  ;  , for meta-analyses). These include the IPL, the ventral premotor cortex and the caudal part of the IFG (see Figure 2 in  ). Additional activations in the SPL ( ) and SMA ( ) have also been associated with action execution and action observation. In line with this prediction, our results show activation of such networks during pain empathy, with consistent activation observed in the IPL, ventral premotor cortex, and caudal part of the IFG, SPL and SMA. The experience of pain is associated with expected or observable actions, such as the withdrawal of a hand from a noxious object, which might engage this \u2018mirroring\u2019 system at the basis of the perception\u2013action coupling mechanism. In addition to an internal representation of the motor aspects of the other\u2019s pain, an SS representation of the observed pain might also be triggered during pain empathy. Indeed, our general map of pain empathy showed consistent activations in the SS cortices and thalamus, brain areas related to the capacity to discriminate sensory characteristics of direct pain experience, such as the intensity, quality and localization ( ;  ;  ). Thus, a shared neural representation of the other\u2019s SS pain characteristics might unfold during pain observation. Taken together, our results support the view that mirroring mechanisms might be at the origin of the activation of an embodied somatosensorimotor representation of the other\u2019s pain engaged during pain observation. \n\n\n#### Processing social nonverbal communication cues \n  \nIn addition to internal affective and somatosensorimotor representations of the other\u2019s pain, the current results suggest that visual processing of social nonverbal communication cues is performed through both shared and partly distinct channels during pain observation. Indeed, our general ALE map revealed consistent activations in the ITG, more specifically in the EBA and the OFA. Moreover, the conjunction analysis revealed that these structures were commonly activated in paradigms using SS (i.e. limbs submitted to noxious stimulation) and EC cues (i.e. facial expression of pain). The EBA\/OFA are structures classically related to visual perception of human body parts ( ). Furthermore, the general ALE map revealed activation in the amygdala, a structure associated with relevant biological movements, for instance, faces and bodies expressing emotions ( ;  ;  ). The amygdala is also well known to be related to negative emotions such as fear and anxiety ( ), and a recent study showed that when instructed to rate their own affective responses to others\u2019 emotional faces, variations in participants\u2019 amygdala activation were related to the variations in their subjective responses ( ). The body and the face are important agents of communication during social interactions, as they both allow us to express and communicate emotions ( ). As consistent and concurrent activities of the EBA\/OFA and amygdala were found in the current work, these regions may work in concert to detect and process socioemotional nonverbal communication cues during pain empathy. From an evolutionary point of view, the processing of socioemotional cues has an adaptive function of signaling potential dangers to prepare fight-or-flight responses ( ). When empathizing, the detection of socioemotional cues might be a basic process relevant in order to understand others\u2019 EC cues, for instance, of fear and\/or anxiety, associated with the pain experience and to initiate, if needed, fight-or-flight responses. \n\nOur general ALE map across all selected fMRI studies on pain empathy provides quantitative meta-analytic evidence that several brain structures are implicated during pain observation; these brain structures subserve internal somatosensorimotor and affective representations of the other\u2019s pain, in addition to processing relevant social nonverbal communication cues. However, these results do not indicate if some of these structures could be a part of secondary networks involved in the processing of specific aspects of the other\u2019s pain experience or are related to different cognitive processes in the observers, such as taking different perspectives. ALE conjunction and subtraction analyses were performed to examine more closely how different visual pain cues and observers\u2019 perspectives might be related to specific networks. \n\n\n\n### Secondary networks implicated during pain empathy \n  \n#### Visual cues \n  \nIn addition to a core empathy network, secondary networks related to specific pain visual cues have been identified. Indeed, subtraction analysis revealed that SS cues (i.e. observation of body parts in painful situations) were related to activations in the SPL and IPL, in addition to the AI bilaterally. Pain empathy studies show that SS pain information generally involves action understanding (inferior parietal\/ventral premotor cortices) and SS processes to a greater extent compared to other types of pain visual information, such as abstract cues ( ) or EC pain information ( ). In addition, as mentioned earlier, the AI is a key node permitting interoceptive and subjective representations of pain experience\/observation and encoding evaluative aspects of pain. The results of the current work extend these findings and establish a distinct neural network engaged by the observation of SS pain cues during pain empathy. This type of pain visual cues seems to engage action understanding, SS sensation processes, and embodied conscious pain representation, and thereby probably engage a somatosensorimotor pain representation to a greater extent compared to EC pain cues. \n\nIn contrast, EC pain cues (i.e. facial expression of pain) were related to specific activations in the bilateral IFG (BA 45\/47). The present results reveal new findings not reported in a recent ALE meta-analysis also examining differences between EC and SS pain cues ( ). Indeed, the study by  ) did not show distinct higher ALE values for EC pain cues compared to SS pain cues, as was found in the present study. The divergence of results may be related to differences in the number and selection of studies.  ) included 48 experiments that used an SS pain paradigm and 22 experiments that used an EC pain paradigm for their ALE contrasts analyses. In our work, we included 53 experiments in the SS pain condition and 25 experiments in the EC pain condition for our ALE contrasts analyses. In addition, the included experiments were not extracted from exactly the same studies. For instance, in the current work, some studies were excluded during the selection of the studies process, as they used complex visual scenes as stimulus or were not reporting results from a healthy adult population, and consequently were not included in the EC pain condition, which were included in  ). Inversely, some studies were included in the current meta-analysis (e.g.  ;  ), which were not in  ). It is, however, difficult to determine why these studies were not included in  ), as the inclusion\/exclusion criteria for each condition (e.g. EC pain paradigm) were not specified in details. Thereby, a direct comparison of results of both meta-analyses based on the selected studies for each condition is hazardous. Another explanation could be related to differences in the choice of statistical thresholds. In  ), images were thresholded to a corrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 level using a cluster-level inference (5000 permutations, initial cluster-forming threshold of FDR   P  \u00a0<\u20090.01). In the current work, images were thresholded at first to an FDRpN   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05 and then to an uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001 using a cluster-level inference (5000 permutations, initial cluster-forming threshold of FDR   P  \u00a0<\u20090.01). Clusters were found in the bilateral IFG with the uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001, whereas no cluster was found with an FDRpN   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05. Thereby, differences in results between  ) meta-analysis and current meta-analysis might be related to differences in thresholds. We cannot exclude that the distinct activation found in the bilateral inferior frontal lobule for the EC pain cue compared to somatosensory pain cue might be a false positive (as an uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001 increases the rate of false positives). However, the large number of empirical studies (e.g.  ;  ), as well as qualitative reviews and theoretical papers (e.g.  ;  ;  ) supporting the functional dissociation between SS and EC pain cues during pain communication (e.g.  ) and empathy (e.g.  ), instills confidence in the present findings. The absence of effect found in  ) might be related to a false negative due to a more conservative statistical control. A role for the IFG in the distinctive processing of EC cues appears highly plausible based on the available literature. \n\nThere are many studies supporting the multifunctional role of the IFG in human nonverbal communication during interpersonal interactions, including through intentional body movements (emblematic gestures;  ) and facial expression of pain (see  , for a review). Motor mirroring processes located in the IFG may allow human to understand others\u2019 communicative gestures, including facial expressions ( ;  ;  ). As the IFG is a structure classically related to speech production ( ), as well as face imitation ( ;  ;  ), social-affective researchers have suggested that there may be a common evolutionary root between speech production and gesture recognition, which would permit the understanding of others\u2019 communicational cues during nonverbal interactions ( ) and more broadly during empathy ( ;  ). \n\nOur results are also consistent with other studies showing the involvement of the IFG during empathy ( ;  ). In particularly, the left IFG is found to be related to the evaluation of emotional face expressions ( ). In  ,  ), the evaluation and production of meaningful facial expressions of pain were related to a greater activation in the IFG compared to the discrimination and imitation of motor components of the same facial expressions. In another study, a group of patients with lesions in the either left (  n  \u00a0=\u20093) or right (  n  \u00a0=\u20095) IFG (BA 44\/45) showed altered emotional empathic abilities, as measured by the two affective scales (personal distress and empathic concern) of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ( ). These results suggest that the IFG not only contributes to understanding others by imitation but also subserves an affective\/evaluative aspect of the other\u2019s pain experience. In sum, our results are in line with previous studies supporting the important role of the IFG in the evaluative\/affective component of the other\u2019s pain when the pain experience is communicated through sociocommunicative cues. Facial expressions of pain may be a symbolic and abstract gesture of the affective pain experience shared by others. \n\nTaken together, results of the current work expand upon previous findings and add robustness to the neural dissociation related to distinct pain visual cues. Our results, which are based on a large data set of neuroimaging literature, establish a neural dissociation between SS and EC pain information during pain empathy. SS cues activated brain areas associated with somatosensorimotor resonance (SPL, IPL, AI), whereas EC cues activated distinctly regions related to social nonverbal communication, such as gestures and affective resonance (IFG). \n\n\n#### Visuospatial perspective \n  \nUnlike visual pain information, differences in visuospatial perspectives do not seem to recruit specific neural networks, although differences in activation were found in a number of brain regions. Indeed, based on the subtraction analyses, no specific clusters were found to be consistently activated for the 1PP or the 3PP. However, when examining the single ALE map of both perspectives separately, some differences can be observed. A first-person compared to a third-person visuospatial perspective seems to evoke a larger number of brain activations related to somatosensorimotor resonance (SPL, IFG, premotor and SMA cortices) and visual perception of body parts (ITG\/EBA), suggesting that a 1PP results in a more robust embodied self-pain representation. This result is consistent with previous studies documenting the effect of the visuospatial perspective on neural response during pain observation. Pain assessment responses are faster ( ), pain evaluation is higher ( ), and brain activity is greater ( ;  ) when viewing limbs in noxious situations from a 1PP compared to a 3PP. In sum, a 1PP seems to facilitate pain somatosensorimotor resonance, but such differences should be interpreted with caution given the absence of significant effect in the contrast analyses. Future brain imaging research should further examine how activity within those areas relates to relevant behavioral responses to pain in self and others. \n\n\n#### Cognitive perspective \n  \nTo date, studies on cognitive perspective during pain observation are inconsistent and limited. On the one hand, studies show that imagining oneself in pain during pain empathy paradigms is related to higher self-ratings ( ;  ) and enhanced activation in brain structures related to SS resonance (SII) and affective resonance (ACC and insula) ( ;  ;  ). For instance,   noted a higher signal change associated with a self-oriented perspective in the middle insula and PI compared to adopting the perspective of a sufferer. On the other hand, in the study by  , no effect of the instruction was identified at either the behavioral or neural level, regardless of the visuospatial perspective. The current study provided a meta-analytic examination of the effect of instructions designed to orient the participant\u2019s perspective toward the self- or the other\u2019s pain. \n\nBased on the subtraction analysis, the current study showed no specific activation related to a self- or other-oriented perspective considering only paradigms using SS pain visual cues. However, when considering paradigms using SS and EC visual cues, specific activations were found in the left AI for the self- compared to other-oriented perspective. A self-oriented instruction seems to rely more on an embodied pain representation compared to other-oriented instruction, but this effect is found only when both SS and EC pain cues are used. As shown earlier, the present study tend to support the idea that SS compared to EC pain visual information enhance activity in regions related to pain somatosensorimotor resonance (i.e. superior parietal lobule, IPL, and AI) to a greater extent. Perhaps, when using an instruction designed to modulate the participant\u2019s perspective on top of viewing SS visual cues only, the effect of instructions is too small to be detected. \n\nThe current research also demonstrates that instructing participants to direct their attention toward the stimulus (stimulus-oriented perspective) during pain empathy was related to activations in specific regions compared to an instruction orienting the participants\u2019 attention toward the others, namely, in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, MOG\/IOG, IPL and PreCG\/IFG. The attention network model of  ) suggests a large-scale dorsal frontoparietal network that embodies orienting attention processes to the external environment by sending top-down biasing signal to sensory input. Indeed, if a person directs his or her attention toward a particular sensory modality, information processing is greatly facilitated for the corresponding stimuli and suppressed for the nonattended stimuli ( ). Moreover, activation can increase in the bilateral inferior frontal areas and in the anterior core of the dorsal network during tasks where participants are required to detect a target presented in a stream of frequent and standard stimuli (see  , for a quantitative fMRI meta-analysis). Here, the higher ALE values in occipital and frontoparietal areas for stimulus-oriented compared to other-oriented instructions may reflect a stronger exteroceptive attentional focus in the former condition. Rather than allowing participants to process pain stimuli according to how they naturally attend to the other\u2019s emotional state, a stimulus-oriented instruction could shift the participants\u2019 attention more toward the visual features of the stimuli. In other words, using a stimuli-oriented instruction during a pain empathy task seems to increase top-down attentional control subserved by the dorsal frontoparietal network. \n\nFinally, when comparing the single ALE maps for the self- and other-oriented perspectives, a larger number of brain regions related to the pain empathy network are observed for the other-oriented perspective. A possible explanation may be related to the greater variability in the instructions verbatim used to orient the participants\u2019 perspective and spontaneous strategies adopted by participants to orient their perspective. Across the studies using a self-oriented instruction, some provided more precise instructions than others on how to adopt a self-oriented perspective. For example, some studies requested participants to \u2018try to experience the feelings of the person whose body part is shown in the pictures\u2019 (e.g.  ). This type of formulation is more specific and may help participants accomplish the task more adequately and minimize heterogeneity across participants. Other studies using a self-oriented instruction mentioned to \u2018take their own perspective\u2019 (e.g.\n ). This type of instruction is more abstract and may be interpreted differently between participants. On the other hand, studies using other-oriented instructions usually used either a pain discrimination task or a pain evaluation task. In these studies, instructions are generally more precise and clear. This type of task may engage participants more in the other\u2019s pain experience and therefore in a more embodied pain experience. \n\nAnother explication could be that some studies included a behavioral measurement (e.g. rating the level of unpleasantness and\/or of intensity of the pain or rating the amount of the pain on a visual analog scale or a Likert scale) while others not, and this is not perfectly distributed across our conditions over the whole sample of studies. Also, for studies that included a behavioral measurement, the rating period could be before, during or after the scanning session and thereby be or not part of the targeted period of interest. From a set of 15 experiments that used an SS paradigm included in the self-perspective condition, 47% were asking the participants to rate something during the scanning session. From a set of 17 experiments that used either an SS or an EC paradigm included in the self-perspective condition, 47% were using rating during the scanning session. From the set of 36 experiments that used an SS paradigm included in the other-perspective condition, 67% were using rating during the scanning session. From the set of 47 experiments that used either an SS paradigm or an EC paradigm included in the other-perspective condition, 72% were using rating during the scanning session. All these differences related to the behavioral measures (i.e. the moment of rating, the type of rating, the instructions of the ratings, etc.) are all possible confounding variables and could have influenced the processes (e.g. motor, anticipation, action, monitoring, etc.) at play during the conditions. See column Behavioral Measures in   for more details on these methodological differences. \n\n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSeveral efforts have been made to carry out an exhaustive search and to obtain a maximum of experiments in each condition. Nevertheless, three conditions had a low number of experiments for the ALE quantitative analysis (  n  \u00a0=\u200910 for third-person visuospatial perspective,   n  \u00a0=\u200915 for self-oriented cognitive perspective,   n  \u00a0=\u20098 for stimuli-oriented cognitive perspective).  ) suggested that an ALE meta-analysis requires at least 20 experiments to achieve a reasonable power. Meanwhile, the results in  ) indicate a relatively good balance between type I and II errors, with conditions involving only 10 experiments. An up-to-date meta-analysis might be necessary in the near future to strengthen or perhaps to nuance the available findings and interpretations once additional fMRI studies of pain empathy are conducted for these more specific conditions. Another explanation for the lack of significant results for some of the analyses conducted, in particular the subtraction analyses, can possibly stem from the methodological discrepancies among the experimental designs across studies. Indeed, other factors might contribute to the heterogeneity across studies: methodological factors, such as the inclusion or not of a behavioral measure (i.e. to rate different aspects of the pain) during the scanning session, characteristics of the targets depicted in the stimuli and\/or sociodemographic characteristics of participants. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, undertaking a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on pain empathy and comparing the influence of different pain empathy paradigms on the brain response are essential steps to gain an improved understanding the neurobiological basis of human empathy. Synthesizing the abundance of fMRI reports on pain empathy allows for improved sample size, statistical power and validity compared to considering only results from single neuroimaging studies. The current meta-analysis demonstrates that empathy recruits different neural networks associated with affective resonance, somatosensorimotor resonance and the processing of nonverbal socioemotional communicational cues. Moreover, this work provides evidence that differences in emotional visual information, visuospatial perspective and cognitive perspective taking involve the brain networks underpinning empathy to varying degrees. In addition, results suggest that pain empathy paradigms are particularly efficient in recruiting brain structures that are related to the affective components of empathy (i.e. AI and aMCC\/ACC), as well as the regions related to pain somatosensorimotor resonance (i.e. IPL, SPL and IFG). This highlights the need to develop other paradigms that would particularly solicit other components of empathy, such as the cognitive component of empathy, or emotion regulation processes in the context of pain, as this would help to broaden our understanding of empathy processes and their related neural correlates. Finally, although different neural networks implicated in empathy have been identified, it remains unclear how these networks are interrelated. As empathy emanates from several interacting components, fMRI studies using global multivoxel pattern analysis and investigating connectivity patterns would be relevant in order to yield stronger interpretations of the interrelations between these networks. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors certify that they have no actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding the research reported in this article. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6847411,"text_md5":"a06d13a94b8c48d3b03bc45393119060","field_positions":{"authors":[0,78],"journal":[79,103],"publication_year":[105,109],"title":[120,248],"keywords":[262,363],"abstract":[376,1868],"body":[1877,72383]},"batch":1,"pmid":31393982,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsz055","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6847411","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6847411"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6847411\">6847411<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6847411  A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on pain empathy: investigating the role of visual information and observers\u2019 perspective"}

Although several studies identify the amygdala as a core brain region in social cognition, quantitative approaches evaluating its role are scarce. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nThis review aimed to assess the role of the amygdala in the processing of facial trustworthiness, by analyzing its amplitude BOLD response polarity to untrustworthy versus trustworthy facial signals under fMRI tasks through a Meta-analysis of effect sizes (MA). Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analyses were also conducted. \n\n\n## Data sources \n  \nArticles were retrieved from MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and Web-of-Science in January 2016. Following the PRISMA statement guidelines, a systematic review of original research articles in English language using the search string \u201c(face OR facial) AND (trustworthiness OR trustworthy OR untrustworthy OR trustee) AND fMRI\u201d was conducted. \n\n\n## Study selection and data extraction \n  \nThe MA concerned amygdala responses to facial trustworthiness for the contrast Untrustworthy vs. trustworthy faces, and included whole-brain and ROI studies. To prevent potential bias, results were considered even when at the single study level they did not survive correction for multiple comparisons or provided non-significant results. ALE considered whole-brain studies, using the same methodology to prevent bias. A summary of the methodological options (design and analysis) described in the articles was finally used to get further insight into the characteristics of the studies and to perform a subgroup analysis. Data were extracted by two authors and checked independently. \n\n\n## Data synthesis \n  \nTwenty fMRI studies were considered for systematic review. An MA of effect sizes with 11 articles (12 studies) showed high heterogeneity between studies [Q(11) = 265.68,   p   < .0001; I  = 95.86%, 94.20% to 97.05%, with 95% confidence interval, CI]. Random effects analysis [RE(183) = 0.851, .422 to .969, 95% CI] supported the evidence that the (right) amygdala responds preferentially to untrustworthy faces. Moreover, two ALE analyses performed with 6 articles (7 studies) identified the amygdala, insula and medial dorsal nuclei of thalamus as structures with negative correlation with trustworthiness. Six articles\/studies showed that posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus present positive correlations with increasing facial trustworthiness levels. Significant effects considering subgroup analysis based on methodological criteria were found for experiments using spatial smoothing, categorization of trustworthiness in 2 or 3 categories and paradigms which involve both explicit and implicit tasks. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSignificant heterogeneity between studies was found in MA, which might have arisen from inclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and differences in methodological options. Studies using ROI analysis \/ small volume correction methods were more often devoted specifically to the amygdala region, with some results reporting uncorrected p-values based on mainly clinical   a priori   evidence of amygdala involvement in these processes. Nevertheless, we did not find significant evidence for publication bias. \n\n\n## Conclusions and implications of key findings \n  \nOur results support the role of amygdala in facial trustworthiness judgment, emphasizing its predominant role during processing of negative social signals in (untrustworthy) faces. This systematic review suggests that little consistency exists among studies\u2019 methodology, and that larger sample sizes should be preferred. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nFaces play a key role in signaling social cues such as signals of trustworthiness from which people infer meaning, aiding in the process of decision-making in everyday life [ ,  ]. In fact, decisions about others are influenced by our social interactions [ ,  ] and have inherent repercussions in future outcomes. Our ability to understand the intentions and dispositions of others is therefore a core process in what is called social cognition, a mental process that underlies social interactions [ ]. Previous studies showed that first impressions and in particular judgements of trust can be built based on brief facial exposures in the order of milliseconds [ ,  ]. Although much evidence comes from the use of emotional expressions, trait judgements such as trustworthiness, competence and aggressiveness can result from exposure to neutral faces [ ]. Importantly, it has been argued that the detection of trustworthiness signals is crucial for human survival [ ]. In studies involving different measures of trait importance, different groups and relationships, trustworthiness was considered one of the most relevant traits. In fact, participants rated trustworthiness as the most essential characteristic in personality (among others such as cooperativeness, attractiveness, intelligence, etc) [ ]. Trustworthiness appears to be a social facial signal of special significance, since it provides information about whether other individuals should be approached or avoided, trusted or distrusted [ ]. It has been suggested that trustworthiness judgments may summarize other relevant trait inferences [ ]. Also, it is worth to notice that some studies have suggested a strong correlation between the perceived trustworthiness of faces and the valence component, suggesting that trustworthiness judgments may be sufficient to model how the valence of faces is evaluated in the brain [ ]. \n\nThe social evaluation of faces has been addressed in functional neuroimaging (fMRI) studies [ ,  ,  ,  ] and systematic reviews [ ,  ]. Previous fMRI studies have suggested that facial trustworthiness is related with the activation of areas such as the amygdala, the insula and the fusiform gyrus (FG) [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Mendle-Siedlecki et al. [ ] have systematically looked at the neural correlates of face evaluation, with a focus in differences between linear and non-linear responses as well as between trustworthiness and attractiveness studies. Bzdok et al. [ ] also focused on trustworthiness and attractiveness, and investigated the nature of overlapping brain networks. Both articles outline the involvement of the amygdala in face evaluation, such as during trustworthiness judgements. However, to our knowledge no other studies systematically and quantitatively assessed the amygdala response to facial signals of trustworthiness, such as untrustworthy and trustworthy faces, either under appraisal or under neuroeconomic interactions (e.g. Trust game, Ultimatum game) relying on trustworthiness decisions, particularly when taking in consideration fMRI methodology (e.g. ROI-based, whole-brain). \n\nIn general, the amygdala has been connected with lower-level emotional processing, particularly of negative stimuli, interacting with other subcortical and cortical structures for fast threat detection [ ,  ]. Accordingly, some studies have found that the human amygdala is highly implicated when evaluating other people's intentions and affective state, by responding to social cues like fearful faces [ ] and variations in eye gaze [ ]. This corroborates the studies which point to an important role of this structure in the perceived trustworthiness of faces [ ,  ,  ,  ] and in high-level social judgements and perception, more specifically with social, emotional and reward processing [ ]. First evidences came from lesion studies with Adolphs et al. showing that patients with amygdala lesions or dysfunction were not able to judge others' trustworthiness [ ]. In fact, patients with bilateral amygdala damage judged untrustworthy-looking faces as if they were more approachable and trustworthy compared to neurologically normal subjects [ ,  ], a finding that is not observed in unilateral damaged patients [ ]. Overall, the results show that the response of the right amygdala is diminished in clinical conditions affecting social cognition [ ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nAdditionally, some fMRI studies indicate that the activity evoked in the amygdala by untrustworthy-looking faces is higher than for trustworthy-looking ones [ ]. In other words, the amygdala response to faces increases with the decrease of their perceived trustworthiness, even when subjects are performing tasks that do not require explicit evaluation of faces [ ,  ,  ,  ]. This increased response of the amygdala towards untrustworthy faces is sometimes described as following an ordinal quasilinear trend [ ,  ], while other studies have found U-shaped, quadratic responses in this structure [ ,  ] with higher responses at the extremes of the trustworthiness dimension [ ,  ]. Nevertheless, a systematic review and meta-analysis of these data have not yet been performed. \n\nIn sum, the study of decision-making related to social cognition has led to several hypotheses supporting a putative role of the amygdala regarding the trustworthiness of faces. In the current study we planned to answer to the following questions: a) how does the amygdala respond to the polarity of trustworthiness signals in faces? (meta-analysis of effect sizes, MA); b) what regions are involved in face trustworthiness processing (activation likelihood estimation, ALE)? \n\nConsidering the above mentioned questions, a systematic review was conducted to address the role of the amygdala in facial trustworthiness processing, namely in the context of fMRI studies and considering the amplitude of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. PRISMA statements guidelines were followed [ ,  ], with articles being retrieved from three databases, according to a predefined search strategy. \n\nImportantly, additional independent factors have been shown to modulate the amygdala response and should therefore also be taken in consideration. A carefully examination of the methodology and statistical criteria of each study is therefore necessary to evaluate the putative role of the amygdala during trustworthiness judgements. For instance, differences in the fMRI approach used, such as the use of whole-brain or region-of-interest (ROI) based analyses might affect the incidence of false positives. Finally, the use of either   a priori   defined categories or of trustworthiness categories based on the responses of the participants must also be taken in account. Therefore, and considering possible sources of heterogeneity across studies, besides the employed quantitative analyses (MAs and ALE), methodological components of individual studies were considered for subgroup quantitative and descriptive analyses. \n\nThe authors therefore employ systematic and quantitative methods to clarify and to systematize results previously reported in the literature, in order sum up evidence of involvement of amygdala and other regions in the appraisal of facial trustworthiness. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Systematic review \n  \n#### 2.1.1. Data sources and literature search \n  \nA systematic review was performed adhering to the principles of the PRISMA statement [ ,  ]. The PRISMA statement sets steps to systematically reviewing the literature, ensuring that these reviews are performed in a standard and systematic manner. This process underlies 4 phases: identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion ( ). Publications were searched on three databases, notably on MEDLINE, via PubMed ( ), on Science Direct (Elsevier,  ), and Web of Science ( ), using the search string \u201c(face OR facial) AND (trustworthiness OR trustworthy OR untrustworthy OR trustee) AND fMRI\u201d (use of filter \u201carticle\u201d and \u201cshort communication\u201d in ScienceDirect; use of filter \u201carticle\u201d in Web of Science). The search reported herein was undertaken in January 2016, without imposing any start and end date limit. Therefore, the search includes all the articles published until January 2016. References included in the articles deemed appropriate for full-text revision were hand-searched for retrieving other relevant publications. \n   Flow diagram.  \nFlow of information describing the different phases of the systematic review. \n  \n\n#### 2.1.2. Eligibility criteria and screening phase \n  \nFor a study to be considered as eligible, it had to meet the following criteria: (1) be written in English language; (2) involve adult healthy human participants (animal studies were excluded); (3) involve original research articles (e.g. review articles were excluded); (4) use of brain imaging techniques, namely functional neuroimaging (fMRI), (5) assess normal performance without introducing sources of perturbation (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation), (6) directly address \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d and not other related concept, (7) test the contrasts using specifically trustworthy faces and untrustworthy faces (and not a general effect of trustworthiness). Additionally, during the screening phase, studies were considered eligible for the MA of effect sizes if they (8) make direct and separate measurements in the amygdala (e.g. without being included in a general \u201cmedial temporal lobe\u201d label), with statistics (t, Z, r or r ) being reported; and for the ALE if they (9) report the Talairach or MNI coordinates (x, y, z) of the brain regions described, (10) present results of whole-brain analysis. \n\n\n#### 2.1.3. Study selection and data extraction \n  \nThe selection of eligible studies was performed by two authors independently (I.A. and S.S.). The reasons for rejecting the inclusion of a paper, both at this step and throughout the process of paper selection, were discussed between the authors and registered. Disagreements were solved later on by discussion until a consensus was reached. The data was collected and duplicates were eliminated (identification phase). The titles and abstracts of the remaining articles were then screened independently by the two authors (screening phase) and assessed for eligibility. All articles which were considered potentially eligible for criteria (1) to (7) by at least one of the reviewers were included for further full paper assessment (eligibility phase). These were articles presenting face stimuli in a trustworthiness task under an fMRI procedure with measurements of neural activation to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, testing a direct contrast between them or using linear correlation between trustworthiness values and neural activation (inclusion phase) ( ). \n\nBesides the summary statistics for the MA of effect sizes, and the brain coordinates (x,y,z) for the ALE, the following features of the included articles were extracted and summarized in   (see Supporting Information): (1) the type of task (implicit or explicit, e.g. trustworthiness judgements, age or gender categorization; no task \/ passive viewing) with reference to stimulus duration (e.g. subliminal, supraliminal), (2) stimulus type (faces: real or avatars; neutral or emotional), (3) the nature of stimuli presentation (static pictures or dynamic videos); (4) type of task paradigm (block or event-related design); (5) baseline condition; (6) response type and details; (7) participants characterization (sample size; gender, age); (8) data acquisition (MR system and power; sequence parameters); and (9) data analysis (standard brain template\u2014Talairach, MNI; software of analysis; smoothing). \n\nFinally, data were extracted by two authors (I.A. and S.S.), checked independently by each one whenever doubts occurred, and followed by a consensus decision. Importantly, authors of the articles included were contacted to clarify experimental design [ ], methods [ ] or to provide numerical results as only graphical ones were available [ ,  ]. All responded. Gordon et al. [ ] clarified that the study was event-related, Tsukiura et al. [ ] clarified which regions were treated under small volume correction analysis, and both Pinkham et al. [ ] and Freeman et al. [ ] provided numerical data of statistical tests and results only graphically presented in their publications (see   and   Tables). \n\n\n\n### 2.2. Data analyses \n  \nThis review provides both quantitative (MA, subgroup analysis, and ALE) data analysis and non-quantitative (descriptive) summaries of neuroimaging (fMRI) findings and of the methodology used. The list of articles included in the MAs of effect sizes and ALEs can be seen in   and  . \n   Included articles.  \nList of articles included in the systematic review and meta-analyses (MA and ALE). \n      \n#### 2.2.1. Quantitative analyses: meta-analysis of effect sizes \n  \nInclusion criteria for MA were studies using whole-brain, ROI-based and small volume correction analyses, whether applying correction for multiple comparisons or not. Moreover, in order to prevent bias in the results, even studies that did not reach statistical significance after correction or were underpowered were included. Studies presenting contrasts of untrustworthy faces versus baseline [ ,  ,  ]; nonlinearities (e.g. quadratic models\u2014see  ) [ ,  ,  ]; p-values only or graphical information with no available t, Z or r statistical values [ ]; that did not report statistics regarding non-significant contrasts within statistical maps [ ,  ]; or that did not report amygdala activity [ ] were automatically excluded from the quantitative MA (see   and  ). \n   Studies with linear and quadratic response models.  \nType of response model (Linear, Quadratic) which best fitted amygdala activation for faces in the continuum \u2018Untrustworthy\u2014Trustworthy\u2019. Only studies presenting linear models were included in the meta-analysis of effect sizes. \n      \nAfter considering these inclusion and exclusion criteria, a MA was undertaken with statistics resulting from the specific contrast \u2018Untrustworthy > Trustworthy faces\u2019 or from the linear correlation \u2018Untrustworthy\u2014Trustworthy\u2019 using determination and correlation coefficient (r). Whenever those were not available, both   t   and Z statistical values were taken from the original research articles and were considered to estimate the effect sizes (for details see   and  ). \n   Meta-analysis of effect sizes: (A) Confidence intervals (CI) for effect size (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient) and (B) Test for heterogeneity.  \n(A) Sample size, correlation coefficient (effect size transformations) and 95% CI for the contrast \"untrustworthy > trustworthy\" faces in the (right) amygdala. (B) Heterogeneity was assessed both with the inconsistency (I2) statistic and the Q coefficient. \n      \nGiven Student\u2019s t score and z scores as an effect size measure, a common effect size measure was derived using the usual transformations for testing significance of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient either through a Student\u2019s t-test (1) or a Z test by the Fisher\u2019s transformation (2), as follows:\n \nThereby, it was possible to have a common effect size measure to analyze, and thus perform a meta-analysis. As studies reported effect sizes by means of t or z scores, we may propose either a t and Z score by applying the inverse of eqs ( ) and ( ) formulas (formulas ( ) and ( )) to the final effects model index:\n \n\nHeterogeneity was assessed both with the inconsistency (  I   )   statistic and the Q coefficient. The I  Index is a standard test that measures the degree of inconsistency across studies. This test results in a range from 0% to 100%, which describe the proportion of variation in treatment effect estimates due to inter-study variation [ ]. It may be interpreted as the proportion of total variance in the estimates of treatment effect that is due to heterogeneity between studies and thus it has a similar concept to the intraclass correlation coefficient in cluster sampling [ ]. The Q coefficient was also used to calculate the homogeneity of effect sizes [ ]. A global index about the effect\u2019s magnitude should then be derived either from a fixed-effects model or from a random effects model [ ]. If the studies only differ by the sampling error (  I   < 50%  , homogeneous case), a fixed-effects model is applied in order to obtain an average effect size. If the studies\u2019 results differ by more than the sampling error (  I   > 50%  , heterogeneous case) a random-effects model is preferred instead [ ]. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed in order to access heterogeneity between studies and thus, to obtain a global measure of effect which summarizes effect measures reported in individual studies. This last one may be merely indicative whenever the amount of heterogeneity is high and the number of studies is small, as is the case we studied, and must therefore be complemented with individual effect sizes and their respective confidence interval. \n\nAll the estimates included were recomputed from original articles descriptions, potentially resulting in slightly different values. All reported   p  -values are 2-tailed and analyzed at a significance level of 5%. Meta-analysis was performed with the software package MedCalc (R) (version 12.7.2.0\u201364 bit, Copyright 1993\u20132013, MedCalc Software bvba, Mariakerke, Belgium). \n\n\n#### 2.2.2. Quantitative analyses: subgroup analysis \n  \nA subgroup analysis was performed by considering methodological options of experimental design, acquisition and analysis parameters of each study (for a list of factors see section 2.1.3, and for a detailed characterization see   and   Tables). Nine criteria (experimental design: (1) paradigm, (2) type of categorization; acquisition: (3) software of analysis, (4) echo time, (5) repetition time, (6) type of sequence; analysis: (7) correction for multiple comparisons, (8) smoothing, (9) contrast) were considered to group the articles\/studies ( ). \n\n\n#### 2.2.3. Quantitative analyses: activation likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nALE is a voxel-based method implemented to find convergence across functional neuroimaging experiment coordinates [ ], and was performed to asses if there were consistent functional activations present in the studies evaluating the trustworthiness from faces. \n\nSince ALE can only be performed with explicitly reported coordinates of the activated areas, only studies presenting data reported in standard stereotactic coordinates (either Talairach or MNI) were considered for the voxel-level quantitative meta-analysis [ ] (studies performed using contrasts considered in this systematic review but presenting null results were nevertheless included, but with no data regarding the coordinates). We excluded studies presenting results where main effects analyses were restricted to   a priori   defined ROIs or using small volume correction, with unobtainable coordinates, data with nonspecific contrasts relative to baseline or tasks not evaluating trustworthiness [ ,  ] (see  ). For this analysis, data with uncorrected p-values were considered, using only results of adult healthy control (HC) groups (see  ,   and   Tables). \n\nTwo separate ALE meta-analyses were conducted with coordinates resulting from: (1) a negative correlation between neural responses to faces and trustworthiness (i.e., increase of the neural response with the decrease of trustworthiness levels) and (2) a positive correlation between neural responses to faces and trustworthiness (i.e., increase of the neural response with the increase of trustworthiness levels). \n\nALE meta-analyses were performed in Talairach space, using GingerALE 2.3 ( ). Anatomical coordinates reported in MNI space were converted to Talairach space using the Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation [ ]. In ALE analysis, all foci reported for each experiment are modeled as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution. In order to model the spatial uncertainty of each focus, this approach takes into account the inter-subject and inter-laboratory variability observed in neuroimaging studies by adjusting the width of the smoothing Gaussian kernel. The information of individual foci is then merged, taking the voxel-wise union of their probability values. As a result, a modelled activation map is calculated by finding the union [ ] or the maximum [ ] across each Gaussian focus. The final ALE image corresponds to the union of each individual modelled activation maps [ ]. \n\nRegarding this analysis, the obtained ALE maps were thresholded using 1000 permutations,   p   < .001 as cluster-forming threshold and   p   < .05 for cluster-level inference [ ]. The cluster statistics identified ALE clusters, providing the coordinates of the weighted center-of-mass and peak locations, and anatomical labels were assigned by the Talairach Daemon [ ]. \n\nThe results are reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines on reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ ]. \n\n\n#### 2.2.4. Non-quantitative analysis \n  \nThe studies or results which could not be included in the quantitative statistical meta-analyses (MA and ALE) were nevertheless considered for a non-quantitative analysis. In this analysis, we reviewed the results regarding amygdala and other regions\u2019 response to the untrustworthy vs. trustworthy face contrasts. \n\nIn addition to the quantitative subgroup analysis presented in section 2.2.2, differences in methodologic issues of each study were summarized and discussed. Importantly,   a priori   hypotheses concerning amygdala involvement in trustworthiness processing and subsequent methodology options within studies were considered. \n\n\n\n### 2.3. Risk of bias \n  \nAssessment of risk of bias of individual studies and across studies was undertaken. In order to prevent a biased literature search in what concerns amygdala\u2019s involvements in trustworthiness processing of facial stimuli, the \u201camygdala\u201d keyword was not included as a search term. Independent assessment of articles for inclusion and data extraction was performed by two authors (I.A. and S.S.), with discussion until a consensus was achieved. \n\nMethodological components were extracted from individual studies (  and   Tables) and used for subgroup analysis of effect sizes. Measures of variability between studies were used within the MA, and this was performed including both positive and null results of amygdala activation to the contrast Untrustworthy > trustworthy faces. Finally, only whole-brain studies were included in the ALE analysis (ROI-based and small volume correction studies were excluded). \n\nIn order to access the existence of publication bias within the meta-analysis of effect sizes, i.e. different dissemination of research findings as an effect of the nature and direction of results [ ], funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression test of asymmetry were further performed. For the funnel plot, R software (R Studio, Version 0.99.903, RStudio, Inc.) was used, with the correlation coefficients being centered in the mean effect (normalized to \u201c0\u201d). Importantly, standard error of the intervention effect estimate was plotted on the vertical axis, as recommended [ ]. The Egger\u2019s regression test is used to quantify the bias captured in the funnel plot, and uses the values of the effect sizes and their precision [ ]. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nThe Flow Diagram displayed in   reflects the selection process. Our review of the literature using search items as described above identified 316 potential target articles [34 were identified via the PUBMED database, 240 through ScienceDirect and 42 via Web of Science], with 1 article being identified through other resources, namely reference lists of related articles. Forty-four articles were duplicated records, and 63 referred to non-original research articles (e.g. review, methods paper, commentary) being therefore excluded. Other reasons for exclusion were studies employing animal and not human participants (n = 2), lack of use of fMRI methodology (n = 78), and no direct assessment of trustworthiness in human faces (n = 98). A total of 32 publications were carried to full text assessment. From the identification to the eligibility phase, 285 articles were excluded, based on the information displayed in the abstracts, taking into account criteria (1) to (6) (see   section). Twelve additional articles were not considered in the final set as they did neither test a direct contrast between Trustworthy and Untrustworthy faces, nor tested a linear correlation with amygdala activity. The remaining 20 articles underwent quantitative (section 3.1) and non-quantitative (section 3.2) data extraction and analysis. All were published in the last 10 years, except one which dates from 2002 [ ]. Characterization of the articles\/studies included is detailed in  . Specifically for the quantitative analysis, the articles were incorporated in the MA of effects (sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3) and\/or in the ALE analyses (sections 3.1.5 and 3.1.6). \n\n### 3.1. Quantitative analysis \n  \n#### 3.1.1. Meta-analysis of effect sizes: excluded studies \n  \nGiven the overall inclusion criteria specifically for the quantitative MA (see section 2.1.2), nine articles and 1 study were excluded due to the fact that (a) right and left amygdala were concatenated in one single ROI resulting in conjoint statistics (2 articles: [ ,  ]); (b) the contrast was performed with untrustworthy faces against baseline conditions or average trustworthiness faces (3 articles: [ ,  ,  ]; 1 study: [ ]); and (c) the article did not provide the values (t, Z, r or r ) of the contrast (4 articles: [ ,  ,  ,  ]). Eleven articles (12 studies) fulfilled the criteria of inclusion in the MA. \n\n\n#### 3.1.2. Meta-analysis of effect sizes: contrast \u2018untrustworthy > trustworthy\u2019 faces \n  \nAn unbiased MA was performed by including also studies that were either underpowered or showed uncorrected results. Results of 12 studies from 11 articles were used to measure the amplitude of (right) amygdala responses in the contrast \u2018Untrustworthy > Trustworthy\u2019 faces. \n\nGiven transformations of t and Z values, a common effect size measure to analyze was derived. As we may not assume a Z distribution since some of the studies reported t-scores, if is preferable to report the final effect size measure by means of t-scores. On the other hand, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient test usually applies the r-to-t transformation. Results shown in   and   present right amygdala responses for \u2018Untrustworthy > Trustworthy\u2019 faces, showing a clear lateralization trend. The Cochran \u03c7  test (commonly known as the Q test) indicated a large amount of heterogeneity between studies (Q(11) = 265.68,   p   < .0001). However, it is usually stated that this test has poor power when few studies are being analyzed [ ] and Higgins et al. suggested the use of other measures, such as the I  Index [ ]. For this meta-analysis, performed on 12 studies and involving 183 cases, the I  Index was 95.86% (94.20% to 97.05%, with 95% confidence interval, CI), thereby confirming the large amount of heterogeneity between studies. \n   Meta-analysis of effect sizes (n = 11): Confidence intervals for effect size (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient).  \nForest plot resulting from the meta-analysis with 12 studies (11 articles) for the contrast \"Untrustworthy > Trustworthy\" faces presenting central values of correlation coefficients (square markers) and their confidence intervals (horizontal lines). The size of the square markers varies with the sample size. Diamond markers represent pooled effects. The location of the diamond represents the estimated effect size and the width of the diamond reflects the precision of the estimate. \n  \nA global index about the effect\u2019s magnitude of amygdala\u2019s response to untrustworthiness was therefore derived from a random effects (RE) model [ ], indicating a linear correlation (r = .851), where the lower limit for the confidence interval indicates strong correlation (r > .4) and thus a large effect size, as observed also in   (RE(183): 0.422 to 0.969, 95% CI). Of the 12 studies (11 articles) studies considered, six resulted in a weak to moderate correlation [ \u2013 ,  ,  ], as all the other report correlations above .89 (with 95% CI above 68%). \n\nAlthough random-effects can be used as a global measure of effects, given that these effects derive from a small number of studies (n = 12), with high heterogeneity, one should consider also the individual effects. Therefore, we also analyzed descriptively the studies included. \n\nOf the 12 studies considered, all of the studies reported a negative correlation of amygdala activity with facial trustworthiness (direction untrustworthy > trustworthy), except one [ ] which reported a positive correlations of amygdala with Trusting behavior, and 2 others which failed to find significance [ ,  ]. Additionally, 3 studies did not report statistics associated to the outcomes of the contrast between untrustworthy and trustworthy faces, with 3 other studies reporting no differences using small volume correction [ ,  ] or cluster correction [ ] and 1 finding differences in the right amygdala ROI at the   p   < .05 level [ ]. \n\nRegarding correlation coefficients, Freeman et al. [ ] studies, both the subliminal and supraliminal tasks, and Said et al. [ ] showed weaker correlations (r below .5) than the other 5 (tested in the direction untrustworthy > trustworthy faces) correlation studies. Two studies [ ,  ] showed absolute values between .5 and .7. These results had a direct impact in the 95% Confidence Intervals, with only 4 studies showing CI above 90% [ ,  \u2013 ]. Large CIs were particularly found in 4 studies [ \u2013 ,  ] limiting the generalization of conclusions regarding the results of this contrast in the population. \n\nThis model showed that right amygdala responses in adult HCs are higher to untrustworthy compared to trustworthy faces. \n\n\n#### 3.1.3. Meta-analysis of effect sizes: subgroup analysis \n  \nGiven the heterogeneity found between studies (see above section), subgroups were generated according to methodological components taken from the experimental design, data acquisition and analysis parameters (for details concerning these factors, see Supporting Information,   and   Tables). Results showing the subgroups of studies included in the MA and in which the effect was verified are presented in a forest plot ( ) displaying all the factors and levels (groups) considered. \n\nStatistically significant positive effects (Untrustworthy > trustworthy) were found within the groups of Smoothing \u201c8 mm\u201d [ ,  ,  ], Task paradigm \u201cExplicit (+implicit)\u201d [ ,  ], and for the division of Trustworthiness values in 2 to 3 categories (instead of using a Likert type scale) [ ,  ]. All the remaining factors and\/or levels analysed presented mainly observed positive effects, although not statistically significant, according to the expected 95% confidence interval obtained for the respective effect. Importantly, one must point that all tended to a positive effect but the large amplitude of the confidence intervals precludes a significant statistical criterion. This may be explained by the large variability within studies mainly due to their sample size. \n\n\n#### 3.1.4. ALE: excluded studies \n  \nTwelve articles were excluded from the ALE analysis, due to (a) data with nonspecific contrasts relative to baseline (3 articles: [ ,  ,  ]); (b) lack of reporting Talairach or MNI coordinates (1 article: [ ]); (c) ROI-based or small volume correction analysis (8 articles: [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]) (see   for a detailed list of exclusion criteria). \n\nTwo ALE meta-analysis were performed. The first analysis, concerning the negative correlation between neural responses to faces and trustworthiness, was performed with 7 studies from 6 articles. The second analysis, regarding the positive correlation between neural responses to faces and trustworthiness, was conducted with data from 6 studies retrieved from 6 articles. \n\n\n#### 3.1.5. ALE: negative correlation with facial trustworthiness \n  \nFor the first analysis, regarding the negative value of face trustworthiness (untrustworthy > trustworthy faces), as assessed by the above mentioned contrast, activation in six clusters was found, including the right and left amygdala, the thalamus (medial dorsal nucleus) and the insula (see   and  ). \n   Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis with 7 studies (6 articles) regarding the negative correlation between neural activation and facial trustworthiness.  \nSome of the modulated regions were a) L amygdala (-18, -4, -18), b) R Amygdala (21, -4, -17), c) R Insula, BA 13 (43, -2, 14) and d) R Thalamus (8, -15, 14). The obtained ALE maps were thresholded using 1000 permutations,   p   < .001 as cluster-forming threshold and   p   < .05 for cluster-level inference. \n     ALE: results for the negative correlation.  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis results highlighting that the amygdala is sensitive to the low face trustworthiness. \n      \n\n#### 3.1.6. ALE: positive correlation with facial trustworthiness \n  \nAs to the second analysis, two clusters were found for the positive relation between faces and trustworthiness (trustworthy > untrustworthy faces), namely the medial frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate (see   and  ). \n   Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis with 6 studies (6 articles) regarding the positive correlation between neural activation and facial trustworthiness.  \nSome of the modulated regions were a) R Cingulate gyrus (6, -43, 25) and b) R Anterior Medial Frontal gyrus (3, 55, 14). The obtained ALE maps were thresholded using 1000 permutations,   p   < .001 as cluster-forming threshold and   p   < .05 for cluster-level inference. \n     ALE: results for the positive correlation.  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis results of regions showing a positive impact of faces trustworthiness. \n      \n\n\n### 3.2. Non-quantitative analysis \n  \nGiven that not all articles were eligible to be included in the quantitative meta-analyses (MA and ALE), screening of the studies\/articles also not included in each quantitative analysis was nevertheless performed in order to respond to questions addressed in the systematic review. \n\n#### 3.2.1. How does the amygdala respond to the polarity of trustworthiness signals in faces? \n  \nConsidering the non-quantitative analysis, overall the studies point to an increased response of the amygdala to untrustworthy compared to trustworthy faces, showing a quasilinear profile [ ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ], with only a few pointing to a quadratic model best fitting the amygdala response [ ,  ,  ,  ] with amygdala responses both to untrustworthy and trustworthy faces. Some of these studies find evidence of both linear and quadratic responses in the right and left amygdalae [ ,  ,  ] (see  ). \n\nImportantly, increased responses to untrustworthy faces are found more consistently in the right amygdala, either against trustworthy faces [ ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ], or against baseline periods, neutral or average-trustworthiness faces [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Of the 20 included articles, whereas 9 studies found significant responses in the right amygdala specifically for the contrast untrustworthy > trustworthy faces, only 4 found the same response pattern in the left amygdala [ ,  ,  ,  ] (in one study the results did not reach statistical difference after multiple correction comparison [ ], but other studies reported uncorrected results, e.g. [ ] (see   for a summary of results for right and left amygdalae), which favor the hypothesis that amygdala response might be lateralized during processing of trustworthiness signals [ ], with stronger modulation for untrustworthiness signals. Accordingly, Pinkham et al [ ] report significant differences in the right amygdala but not for the left one in the HC group. Interestingly, whereas marginal differences between untrustworthy and trustworthy faces during pre-learning phases (previously to association of faces and trustworthiness behaviors) are found in the right amygdala, the left parahippocampal gyrus\/amygdala responds more to faces associated in the context of a related behavioral pattern than faces presented without such context [ ]. The lateralization issue could be a potential factor explaining differences in results from studies which use faces reflecting trustworthy behaviors (e.g. [ ,  ]) compared to faces rated subjectively as more trustworthy (e.g. [ ,  ]). Nevertheless, Gordon and Platek [ ] report that faces belonging to people which more often are engaged in trustworthy behaviors elicit both right and left amygdala activation (ROI-analysis; uncorrected data). Interestingly, this is the only study reporting increased responses to trustworthy as compared to untrustworthy faces [ ]. Finally, in our systematic review and meta-analysis, although the number of studies showing significant (corrected or uncorrected) right amygdala activation for the contrast untrustworthy > trustworthy faces (n = 9) [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ] was larger than for the left one (n = 4) [ ,  ,  ,  ], when directly tested the difference was not statistically significant (\u03c7 (1) = 1,923,   p   = .267). \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Other regions responding to the polarity of trustworthiness signals in faces \n  \nRegarding regions besides the amygdala also involved during social cognition taken from studies which were not included in the ALE analysis, the results show some variability from study to study. Mostly, the regions which are more often reported are the insula [ ,  ,  ], the cingulate cortex or adjacent areas [ ,  ,  ], the superior temporal sulcus (STS) [ ,  ,  ], the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) [ ,  ], the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [ \u2013 ], the FG [ ,  ,  ], and nuclei of the basal ganglia [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Of these, the pattern of responses is either linear [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] or can be fitted using a quadratic model responding to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe right insula is found to show increased responses to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces compared with baseline [ ] matching its left counterpart [ ], although the left insula also shows a linear pattern responding more to untrustworthy than to trustworthy faces as the left anterior cingulate [ ,  ]. Nevertheless, responses of right insula specifically to linear increases of facial untrustworthiness perception are also reported [ ,  ]. The right cingulate shows a quadratic effect regarding trustworthiness ratings [ ] with the paracingulate showing the same effect [ ], and the left anterior cingulate showing linear responses to untrustworthy compared to trustworthy faces [ ]. The left lateralized basal ganglia activity pattern points to a quadratic model, with the left putamen showing increased responses to both extremes of Trusting behavior [ ], although linear responses to untrustworthy faces are also found [ ]. The left caudate shows the same quadratic response to trustworthiness ratings of faces [ ]. In contrast, the right basal ganglia seem to more often show linear responses, with the right putamen responding more to low trust faces [ ,  ] and the right caudate responding in a linear positive manner to trustworthiness ratings. \n\nAs for regions particularly involved in the face network, the right STS either shows increased responses to untrustworthy faces [ ] or follows a quadratic model [ ]. The response of the FG is reported to best fit a quadratic model [ ,  ], with the left responding more to trustworthy faces compared to baseline and the right more to untrustworthy than to baseline [ ]. These results are not contrary to findings that both the left and the right FG respond more to untrustworthy faces than to trustworthy ones [ ]. The activity of the IFG presents differences depending on the hemisphere: the left seems to show a linear pattern of response regarding trusting behavior [ ], whereas the right one shows increased activity to both trustworthy and untrustworthy rated faces [ ]. The mPFC shows increased responses to untrustworthy faces [ ] although reports of quadratic effects are also found [ ]. Three areas showing increased responses to trustworthy faces are the right temporoparietal junction [ ], the left FG [ ] and the left precuneus [ ]. \n\n\n\n### 3.3. Risk of bias \n  \n#### 3.3.1 Graphical evaluation of publication bias: funnel plots \n  \nThe funnel plot testing publication bias within the MA is presented in  . The graphical results point to asymmetry, with a majority of the smaller studies clustering to the left of the mean. \n   Funnel plot.  \nVerification of publication bias in the meta-analysis of effect sizes is graphically represented in a Funnel plot displaying effect size and standard error. \n  \n\n#### 3.3.2 Algebraic evaluation of publication bias: Egger\u2019s regression test \n  \nAlthough the funnel plot pointed to asymmetry, Egger\u2019s regression test revealed non-significant findings (F(1,10) = 3,63;   p   = .086), which means that asymmetry cannot be assumed for the studies included in the MA. The reported variability in the effects of the different studies is explained in 19.3% by the measured precision (inverse of the studies dimension, 1\/n) ( ). \n   Egger\u2019s regression.  \nGraphical results of the regression performed to evaluate asymmetry in the results and publication bias in the meta-analysis of effect sizes. \n  \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analyses show evidence for a role of the amygdala in trustworthiness processing. Importantly, we found evidence for right lateralization, in particular in what concerns larger activation for untrustworthy compared to trustworthy faces. This evidence came both from two different sorts of analyses: MA and ALE. Also, other areas such as the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus seem to be implicated in the network that processes trustworthiness signals in faces, given by the ALE analysis. \n\nSubgroup analyses pointed to particular strong positive effects (untrustworthy > trustworthy faces) in the right amygdala, with narrower confidence intervals in studies which employed methods such as use of both explicit and implicit tasks in the paradigm, two or more categories of trustworthiness values, and spatial smoothing of fMRI data using an 8 mm kernel size. In addition, our revision of studies pointed to a higher amount of ROI-based \/small volume corrected analyses compared to whole-brain ones, with results being reported with uncorrected p-values given the assumption and   a priori   evidence of amygdala involvement in these processes (e.g. [ ]). Nevertheless, no significant differences in effect sizes were found between studies employing restricted volumes or whole-brain analysis. \n\n### 4.1. How does the amygdala respond to the polarity of trustworthiness signals in faces? \n  \n#### 4.1.1. Contrast \u2018untrustworthy > trustworthy\u2019 faces \n  \nOur work systematizes and generalizes the notion that the amygdala shows larger responses for untrustworthy faces, with a right lateralization pattern. This was a clear outcome of our meta-analysis of effects that was also confirmed by ALE. \n\nThe MA pointed to evidence of increased right amygdala response to untrustworthy faces compared to trustworthy ones. Notwithstanding is the extent of the confidence interval (values between 42 and 97%), indicating that there exists a large amount of heterogeneity between studies, also due to the small sample size. Therefore, the global effect should be interpreted carefully. Ideally, the meta-analysis should be replicated with a larger sample size. Nevertheless, random effects measures allow that the results might be generalized to the population, as it considers both within- and between-study variability, even when resulting in broader confidence intervals compared to a fixed-effects analysis [ ]. The MA indicated a positive effect in the right amygdala response to untrustworthy faces when compared to trustworthy ones, namely in studies that used 8 mm spatial smoothing, or studies which have used explicit and implicit experimental task paradigm or used two or three categories for the experimental paradigm instead of a Likert scale (using a continuum of values). Adding to this result, the amygdala appeared as expected as a relevant cluster in the ALE analysis. Regarding the negative correlation between faces and trustworthiness, ALE results reported clusters containing right and left amygdala among others, with the right amygdala cluster presenting a considerably higher cluster size as compared to the left amygdala cluster size. The presence of a larger cluster does not necessarily mean that there is a greater spatial extent in activity within this region. It may alternatively indicate that there is a higher variability in the spatial overlap of included coordinates across studies in a given region [ ]. Nevertheless, if this is true when comparing different regions, it becomes less likely when comparing similar regions such as the right and left amygdala. There is in principle no reason to expect that similar regions would yield different spatial variability. Thus, and since the right amygdala cluster is not only bigger, but also presents higher peak values than the left one, we can conclude that there is stronger involvement of that region. \n\nThe amygdala was suggested to be involved in the extraction of trustworthiness signals from faces (e.g., [ ,  ,  ,  ]) and its activity evoked by untrustworthy-looking faces had been suggested to be higher than for trustworthy-looking ones [ ]. The current analyses generalize the findings that amygdala responses to faces increases with the decrease of their perceived trustworthiness, even when subjects are performing tasks that do not require explicit evaluation of faces [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nMoreover, studies with clinical populations show that the response of the right amygdala is diminished in clinical groups such as autism, schizophrenia and Klinefelter syndrome [ ,  \u2013 ]. Importantly, these effects seem to depend on the explicit (trustworthiness judgments) or implicit (age \/ gender judgments) nature of task. Baas et al. (2008) showed overall decreases in right amygdala activity during judgements of both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces for the schizophrenia (SCZ) clinical group. In the left amygdala, decreased activity was found particularly when performing judgments of trustworthy faces compared to HCs. \n\nInterestingly, a recent structural study showed that increased right amygdala volumes are correlated with higher tendency to rate faces as both more trustworthy and untrustworthy [ ] although this does not clarify if the amygdala then responds also more to facial extremes of trustworthiness. \n\n\n#### 4.1.2. Linear \/ nonlinear response \n  \nAlthough this systematic review included articles showing both linear and nonlinear (quadratic) effects of facial trustworthiness in amygdala response, the studies included in the quantitative meta-analyses (MA and ALE) reported linear effects only. \n\nFrom the 20 articles selected for the systematic review, 5 did however report nonlinear right amygdala responses (see  ). In one of these 5 articles, Freeman and colleagues suggested that the design of the task (blocked versus event-related) could influence the amygdala response [ ]. They performed 2 studies. Experiment 1 results revealed coexisting linear and nonlinear responses, being suggested that the repeated presentations in the blocked-design have induced a task context that increased the tracking of valence over salience. Alternatively, Experiment 2, using an event-related design, showed evidence only of nonlinear effects. The authors referred that the event-related design of this experiment used a wider, continuous range of trustworthiness, leading to the increase of sensitivity to nonlinear effects [ ,  ]. \n\nIn fact, in 2 of the articles reporting nonlinear responses included in the systematic review, the amygdala seemed to behave in a similar manner, i.e., according to the design of the task. Mattavelli et al. [ ] performed a task in which blocked-design was used and, as previously reported in Experiment 1 of Freeman et al. [ ], the amygdala revealed both linear and quadratic responses [ ,  ] (note that Mattavelli et al., [ ] combined right and left amygdalae responses as they state that both hemispheres showed similar response patterns). Another article, in which the task was performed using an event-related design [ ], reported only a nonlinear (right) amygdala response pattern, consistent with the findings of Freeman\u2019s Experiment 2. However, the same behavior was not reproduced in the 2 remaining articles presenting nonlinear right amygdala responses. Despite performing a task with an event-related design, Said and colleagues reported both linear and quadratic responses [ ]. Also, another study, which task was performed with a block-design, have only revealed the existence of a nonlinear representation. In fact, a direct linear contrast between untrustworthy and trustworthy faces resulted in null findings, with linear contrast results arising only between extremes values of trustworthiness and neutral faces [ ]. \n\nA recent systematic review suggests another approach and states that there is compatibility between linear and nonlinear models. It is possible that these analyses are related to distinct processes, in which areas displaying linear patterns may be related to face valence, while regions presenting quadratic patterns may be associated, for example, to face intensity [ ]. According to a meta-analysis that compared nonlinear against linear amygdala responses, the ventral portion of the amygdala was more responsive to negative linear contrasts, while a dorsal portion of the amygdala was more consistently active in nonlinear contrasts [ ]. These results are consistent with other findings, suggesting the involvement of the ventral portion of the amygdala (linear response) in processing valence, while the dorsal portion of the amygdala (nonlinear response) would be recruited when determining the value of ambiguous information [ ]. \n\nThus, it is still not clear if event-related designs influence the amygdala to respond only in a nonlinear manner, and if blocked designs lead to the detection of both linear and nonlinear responses. Nevertheless, the data analyzed in this review (systematized in  ) does not support such hypotheses. \n\nIn conclusion, it would be interesting that future studies could clarify how does the design of the task influences the type of the amygdala response and if different parts of the amygdala are involved in differential signaling of trustworthiness in faces. \n\n\n\n### 4.2. Identification of novel areas involved in face trustworthiness processing \n  \nFor the negative correlation between faces and trustworthiness, the ALE analysis revealed clusters including, among others, the amygdala and the insula, whereas for the positive correlation, areas such as the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus were identified. ALE uses a random-effects model that searches spatial coherence across studies and minimizes the effect of agreement within studies [ ], allowing to generalize the effects to the population. Taking also into consideration the limitations of the ALE model [ ], this is a relevant and novel finding. In fact, areas such as the medial frontal gyrus and the posterior cingulate presented increased activity during social and emotional processing. Accordingly, the medial frontal gyrus has been found to be involved in personal moral judgments, and likewise, the posterior cingulate cortex, also implicated in personal moral judgments, reveals increased neural activity for familiar faces and voices [ ]. Additionally, for the negative correlation between faces and trustworthiness, a cluster in the right insula appeared, reflecting the impact of face untrustworthiness in neural responses. Previous work shows that the insula is involved in the perception and representation of emotional and affective states, playing an important role in the network underlying social decisions [ ]. This result is also consistent with previously reported studies in the literature, since the insula was considered a critical region when performing trustworthiness judgments by responding to low levels of trust, in particular for untrustworthy faces, whether or not trustworthiness was being explicitly assessed [ ,  ]. A recent study has found that the tendency to trust is positively reflected in the volumes of structures like the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and bilateral anterior insula [ ]. Therefore, considering the results of this ALE analysis, one can infer that these regions belong to the network that processes trustworthiness signals in faces, although one should be careful in the establishment of direct correlations between functional and structural data. \n\n\n### 4.3. Factors affecting the study of trustworthiness \n  \nImportantly, although a thorough list factors have been extracted from the original articles and considered to form subgroups, only 3 showed to be relevant for positive effects in the MA, namely the task performed, the trustworthiness type of categorization, and the smoothing applied to data. \n\nIn a previous analysis of studies in the literature, Morawetz et al. [ ] showed that size of the amygdala activation increased, as expected, depending on the option of spatial filtering options used: none, 4 mm or 8 mm. The size of 8 mm for the smoothing kernel increased on average five times the activation volume seen in amygdala, compared to the use of no filter [ ]. The authors conclude that excessive spatial smoothing should be omitted to preserve regional specificity and sensitivity. Our subgroup analysis showed a positive effect (untrustworthy > trustworthy faces) in studies using a kernel of 8 mm [ ,  ,  ], but not in studies using smaller kernel sizes (4, 6 and 7 mm), which is intriguing. In fact, Bos et al. [ ] report null effects which suggests that the likelihood of increased effects does not necessarily hold. \n\nStudies using a mix of explicit and implicit tasks in the fMRI paradigm [ ,  ] also present a more clear effect of the contrast, compared to studies only employing implicit tasks or employing both implicit and explicit ones but analyzing only the later one (see   and   Tables). The type of task has been shown to differentially recruit the amygdala depending if the task requires an implicit or an explicit emotional label [ \u2013 ], with meta-analyses findings either pointing to increased amygdala responses to explicit tasks [ ] or no differences between explicit label of facial emotion and attended incidental processing of stimuli. Passive viewing showed the best odds of activation [ ]. Moreover, the nature of task does not seem to affect laterality of amygdala activation [ ]. \n\nConcerning trustworthiness categorizations, studies using strict categorical conditions [ ,  ] show a more reliable positive effect than studies employing a continuum of trustworthiness values [ ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. In fact, some variability in the methodology used concerning categorization of trustworthiness values is found between studies (see  ). Whereas in some of the studies trustworthiness categorizations into \u201ctrustworthy\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d rely on judgements performed by the participants that also perform the main task (in explicit tasks the judgements are part of the main study), others rely on judgements made by different participants. This would potentially introduce a bias, as trustworthiness judgements are subjective. Nevertheless, the amygdala seems to respond more consistently to consensus ratings of trustworthiness than to idiosyncratic ones [ ,  ], indicating that some features are recognized as trustworthy and as untrustworthy in the general population. Importantly, in one of the articles [ ], the assignment of faces to the trustworthiness conditions was arbitrary and counterbalanced across participants. This might explain why the direct contrast of untrustworthy versus trustworthy faces did not yield significant results in the amygdala region. \n\nAlthough differences in methodology of analysis such as the use of regions of interest or whole-brain analysis do not seem to show differences in terms of global effects in amygdala response to facial trustworthiness, findings resulting from these studies might nevertheless be emphasized. In fact, ROI-based and small volume correction methods imply reduction of voxels for correction of multiple comparisons. Many of the studies collected in this systematic review performed ROI-based analysis \/ small volume correction and reported also uncorrected results, given the   a priori   hypothesis related with the amygdala involvement in social cognition, and in particular, trustworthiness judgements. This hypothesis is based on seminal lesion studies [ ], being corroborated by studies performed in clinical populations (e.g. autism, schizophrenia) in which the function of the bilateral amygdala is thought to be corrupted, leading to the decrease of the amygdala response (and also of other structures) to untrustworthy faces as compared with HCs (e.g. [ ,  \u2013 ]. Therefore, more stringent criteria are required in future studies, for instance, the use of whole-brain analyses with correction for multiple comparisons, with ROI-based \/ small volume correction analyses being used as a complementary method to ask more specific questions within that region. \n\nMoreover, differences between studies addressing trustworthiness based on facial judgements and based on associations of faces and behavioral patterns throughout the task should be taken in consideration, as different aspects of trustworthiness processing are being analyzed, namely perception versus learning. Importantly, first impressions should not be disregarded as there is evidence that amygdala activation reflects more directly impressions of trustworthiness than the actual trustworthiness [ ]. This might explain amygdala responses to untrustworthy faces during pre-learning phases of trustworthy behaviors [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.4. Trustworthiness evaluation using other brain function assessment techniques \n  \nTo our knowledge, almost all studies evaluating the neuronal processes underlying facial trustworthiness are based on fMRI measures. However, other studies have been performed using other methods, like event-related brain potentials (ERP) through the use of Electroencephalography (EEG), which have the advantage of higher temporal resolution. \n\nA study evaluating how facial trustworthiness affected facial processing have shown that trustworthy faces elicited a more positive C1 (earliest evoked visual component peaking negatively between 50\u201390 ms after stimulus onset) than untrustworthy faces. The authors suggest that since C1 was modulated by face-type, the discrimination between trustworthy and untrustworthy faces was performed in this early stage of visual processing. Also, untrustworthy faces elicited a more positive late component (LPC) than trustworthy faces, suggesting that a greater amount of processing related to feedback signaling was allocated to faces categorized as untrustworthy [ ]. \n\nAdditionally, a study that investigated the temporal dynamics of trustworthiness perception revealed that explicit trustworthiness judgments elicit an enhanced early posterior negativity (EPN), with an amplitude enhancement for untrustworthy male faces and trustworthy female faces. The authors speculate that the negativity in the ERP during trustworthiness judgments accompanies the relevance of the faces that should be remembered in future social interactions [ ]. The negativity recorded during these judgments was interpreted as reflecting a higher depth of processing relevant faces. According to their suggestion, this could result from amygdala back projections to the cortex, thus reinforcing the coding of these faces for more effective future interactions [ ]. \n\nAlong with the EPN, a right lateralized effect was also demonstrated, in line with other studies that revealed a primary role of the right hemisphere in face emotional recognition, in particular for stimuli with negative valence [ ,  ]. In fact, the meta-analysis performed in our study has also shown that the right amygdala in particular revealed higher responses for stimuli presenting negative valence (in this case, for untrustworthy faces). \n\n\n### 4.5. Risk of bias and limitations \n  \nOur systematic review applied some methods in order to minimize the introduction of bias in the literature search and results. First, the literature search was performed without using \u201camygdala\u201d as one of the keywords. In fact, although there is primary evidence mainly from lesion studies that the amygdala is involved in extraction of information during trustworthiness judgments [ ,  ], we were interested in evaluating the role of the amygdala within a large set of areas which are also implied in trustworthiness processing. Second, our inclusion criteria considered for ALE only whole brain studies (excluding ROI-based ones which define   a priori   specific regions). Third, a fully unbiased analysis was performed by considering all the results (irrespective of significance and null effects) found in the literature, both for the MA and the ALE. One point must be made however, stating an important distinction between ALE and meta-analyses of effect sizes. In fact, whereas a null-effect is relevant within a meta-analysis of effect sizes, as the later assesses the pooled strength of an effect, ALE measures are only concerned with probabilistic location sites, and therefore null-findings do not influence ALE results. This is an important point within risk of bias and limitations of this method as it emphasizes the existence of a given area while disregarding the number of studies in which that area did not appear. Forth, measures of consistency and heterogeneity (I , Q) were employed in the MA to explore variability between studies. Heterogeneity was found either using Cochran Q and I  results, however, whereas Q is sensitive to the number of included studies [ ], which might be a limitation as we used 12 studies in the MA, I  does not rely on this measure to predict heterogeneity, relying instead on the sample sizes within studies [ ]. Heterogeneity in our MA might then have arisen from studies with smaller sample sizes. \n\nMoreover, regarding reporting bias, we are aware that including ROI-based \/ small volume correction studies in the meta-analyses of effect sizes, and by including uncorrected results in the ALE analysis, our results regarding the amygdala and other regions might even so be emphasized. But, we should point that studies using ROI-based analysis or small volume correction studies did not restrict these analyses to the amygdala, as ROIs \/ small volume correction were also used in regions implicated in social perception and cognition [ ] such as the FG [ ,  ,  ,  ], STS [ ,  ,  ,  ], temporal pole [ ], insula [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ], anterior cingulate cortex [ ], orbitofrontal cortex [ ,  ], mPFC [ ], and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex [ ]. Nevertheless,   a priori   hypothesis justifying ROI analysis \/ small volume correction were more often devoted specifically to the amygdala region [ ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ], which suggests a dominant preference for the amygdala in studies addressing trustworthiness. \n\nOne might point that 11 articles in the MA, or 6 articles in the ALE might limit power for more comprehensive statistical inference. although meta-analysis with only 3 articles [ ] are not rare. In this respect, Yaffe et al [ ] have made a consideration regarding empty reviews [ ,  ] as they usually (1) offer no conclusions, (2) offer conclusions based on referenced excluded studies, (3) offer conclusions based on other evidence, or (4) offer conclusions not based on evidence [ ]. These reviews are still informative in the sense they detail reasons for exclusion adding cues regarding lack of data or possible flaws in the research field. Reasons for empty reviews, which mimic reasons for few studies reviews, are (a) very recent areas of studies; (b) ask research questions which are very specific; or (c) the inclusion criteria are methodologically very demanding in the sake of quality evidence [ ]. As far as we know, the amygdala role in social cognition, and in trustworthiness processing, is largely addressed in the literature (a search in PubMed using \u201camygdala AND trustworth*\u201d returned 40 articles, whereas using \u201camygdala AND (social cognition)\u201d returned 505) and the questions posed in this systematic review are addressed by at least 20 articles. Our systematic review and the small number of studies which were finally included in the meta-analysis can be nevertheless explained by the reason (c), the criteria were methodologically demanding as we decided to include only papers directly comparing conditions of trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, respecting lateralization of amygdala activation (only right amygdala results were considered for the meta-analysis of effect sizes) or which referred to whole-brain analysis (ALE). In this manner, it was our goal to minimize bias in the results of this systematic review. \n\nFinally, in order to evaluate publication bias in the meta-analysis of effect sizes, both funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression test were performed. Although the funnel plot shows a trend for asymmetry, the Egger\u2019s test did not find conclusive evidence for such bias. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThese systematic review and meta-analyses provide an overview of neuroimaging studies regarding the cognitive neuroscience of facial trustworthiness processing. We found evidence for an important role of the amygdala in the social network involved in facial trustworthiness processing, particularly in which concerns untrustworthy faces, despite high heterogeneity between studies. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was consistent with these findings and highlighted an important role for both the amygdala and insula, since these are two of the most commonly involved brain regions when evaluating others\u2019 trustworthiness from faces. \n\nWe also found evidence for novel regions involved in trustworthiness processing, namely the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus. Future studies should aim to elucidate the role of these regions in affective processing of trust in health and disease. \n\nImportantly, the heterogeneity found between studies suggests that little consistency exists in the methodology of study design\/data acquisition\/analysis in the trustworthiness literature. Therefore, particular attention to this issue should be paid, and more stringent criteria should also be used in fMRI analyses given the risk of bias whenever a particular   a priori   hypothesis exists. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5127572,"text_md5":"b45f2e3a53fba425e1b2d19ad315a5d2","field_positions":{"authors":[0,80],"journal":[81,89],"publication_year":[91,95],"title":[106,222],"keywords":[236,236],"abstract":[249,3893],"body":[3902,71050]},"batch":1,"pmid":27898705,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0167276","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5127572","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5127572"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5127572\">5127572<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5127572  The Role of the Amygdala in Facial Trustworthiness Processing: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of fMRI Studies"}

To reduce the economic and health toll of the disease, insight into its pathophysiological mechanism is key to improving treatment and prevention. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies suggest abnormal functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) in migraine patients. This implies that DMN connectivity change may represent a biomarker for migraine. However, the FC abnormalities appear inconsistent which hinders our understanding of the potential neuropathology. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the FC within the DMN in migraine patients in the resting state to identify the common FC abnormalities. With efficient search and selection strategies, nine studies (published before July, 2022) were retrieved, containing 204 migraine patients and 199 healthy subjects. We meta-analyzed the data using the Anisotropic Effect Size version of Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM) method. Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients showed increased connectivity in the right calcarine gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right cerebellum, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right posterior cingulate gyrus, while decreased connectivity in the right postcentral gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, right orbital inferior frontal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. These results provide a new perspective for the study of the pathophysiology of migraine and facilitate a more targeted treatment of migraine in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMigraine is the commonest primary headache in clinical practice. This disabling neurological disorder is characterized by recurrent unilateral or bilateral pulsating headaches ( ). Epidemiological surveys showed that 1.1 billion people suffer from migraine worldwide which constitutes the second leading cause of disability globally ( ;  ). Unfortunately, the surveys also illustrated an upward trend in the incidence of migraine attacks ( ;  ). Given that the disabling effect of the disease foists colossal socio-economic and health costs on its sufferers ( ), scholars found the lack of progress in diagnosis and treatment over the years lamentable ( ;  ;  ). We contend that the stagnation in scientific breakthroughs in this area is mainly due to the lack of insight into the disease\u2019s pathophysiology. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)\u2014a non-invasive method, has been widely used in brain functional research ( ;  ). This method has contributed to the understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism of migraine greatly ( ;  ;  ;  ). Previous rs-fMRI studies demonstrated the close relationship between both the default mode network (DMN) and its associated brain regions and migraine ( ;  ;  ). The DMN is a highly active brain network when the brain is at rest and is associated with an individual\u2019s stressful experiences and his\/her coping strategies that promote adaptation to the (stressful) environment ( ;  ). \n\nA growing body of evidences have revealed the role of non-adaptive responses in migraine mechanisms ( ;  ). These suggested that recurrent migraine attacks alter the functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN and that these changes may disrupt individual stress response mechanisms ( ). Extant studies showed that abnormal FC of DMN has been found in patients with different pain disorders, suggesting that pain has a broad impact on the DMN ( ;  ). In addition, DMN was involved in the pain inhibition process and affected the efficiency of pain processing ( ;  ;  ). The above studies indicate the critical role DMN plays in the neuropathological mechanisms of migraine. So, a fine understanding of DMN may facilitate workable treatment options. \n\nThe identification of spatial patterns of DMN in migraine patients can be based on FC. That is because the FC is capable of exploring the connectivity between brain regions and depicting the complex functional coupling patterns between various brain regions ( ), and has been applied in exploring FC abnormalities in patients ( ). Currently, many scholars have used seed-based FC analysis ( ;  ) and independent component analysis ( ;  ;  ) to explore FC abnormalities within the DMN of migraine patients. However, the inconsistent results of the resting-state FC (rs-FC) within the DMN in migraine patients must not be ignored. Some studies identified decreased rs-FC of the DMN in migraine patients compared to healthy subjects. Decreased functional connectivity was found in the right cerebellum and left frontal lobe in   study,   found decreased connectivity in the prefrontal and temporal regions of the DMN,   found reduced connectivity in the left precuneus of the DMN while others detected increased rs-FC in the DMN,   observed increased DMN FC in the left precentral gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and right cerebellum,   only found increased FC in the left precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex within the DMN. Those discrepant findings may be due to small sample size, patients\u2019 clinical heterogeneity, and the different sample selections ( ). Fortunately, meta-analysis can synthesize neuroimaging findings to reduce the discrepant results ( ). Specifically, the method can aggregate and integrate a large amount of data from studies and distinguish positive results in the process of replication ( ). With the increasing number of published studies about FC in the DMN during the resting state of migraine patients, conducting a meta-analysis to identify common functional abnormalities in the brain is urgently needed to further deepen our understanding of migraine\u2019s pathophysiological mechanisms. \n\nAccordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to assess common alterations in the connectivity of DMN in migraine patients by using the Anisotropic Effect Size version of Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM ( ). Our findings could help harmonize the contradictory results found in the literature and advance the understanding of migraine. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Search strategy and literature screening \n  \nMethods and analyses of the current study were pre-registered on the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022348891).  This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Rigorous Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( ). We searched comprehensively in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for literature up to July 2022, using the combined keywords: (\u201cmigraine\u201d) AND (\u201cresting state\u201d OR \u201crest\u201d) AND (\u201cDMN\u201d OR \u201cdefault mode network\u201d). Further, we searched the reference list of the qualified literature compiled by our manual search from related reviews and references. For studies that did not provide detailed information in the paper (e.g., peak effect coordinates), we contacted the authors by email to obtain relevant information. \n\nFor literature selection, we used the following inclusion criteria: (i) original rs-fMRI study written in English; ( ) patients included in the study meet the diagnostic criteria for migraine; (iii) used seed-based or ICA methods to conduct rs-fMRI data analysis; (iv) direct comparison of rs-FC between migraine patients and healthy subjects; (v) peak coordinates of between-group effects were reported in a standard space, such as Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Studies were excluded if (i) it is a book chapter or review article; ( ) the coordinates of significant statistical differences in rs-FC between groups could not be retrieved even by contacting the author; (iii) the sample in the study overlapped with another published study; and (iv) the seeds were not selected in DMN. According to the above inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible articles were screened and included in this meta-analysis. The literature search and screening were conducted by two investigators independently (S.H and JJ.W) and the relevant studies were double-checked by the two investigators (S.H and JJ.W). Inconsistent studies were discussed and resolved   via   consensus. \n\n\n### 2.2. Quality assessment and data extraction \n  \nTo ensure high data quality, we assessed each included study using a 20-point checklist ( ;  ), which was adapted from previous rs-fMRI meta-analyses. The checklist mainly contains an assessment of the quality of subjects (e.g., demographic and clinical characteristics) and the study methodology (e.g., image procedure, method description), the details of the checklist are presented in  . After quality assessment, important information from each included study was extracted and collated, mainly including the first author, migraine type, sample size, sex ratio, age distribution, disease duration, disease frequency analytical method, seed region, scanner type, and statistical threshold. Furthermore, the current meta-analysis was based on peak coordinates showing the regions of significant differences in rs-FC between-group, therefore, the peak coordinates and their effect values (e.g.,   T  -values or   Z  -scores) of each research were also obtained and sorted into a corresponding text file. \n\n\n### 2.3. Main meta-analysis \n  \nAn anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based   d   mapping (AES-SDM) software package version 5.15 for Windows  was used in the current meta-analysis. SDM is a powerful statistical technique that uses peak coordinates to perform meta-analyses to assess differences in brain activity and has been widely used in recent neuroimaging meta-analyses ( ;  ;  ). Following the guidance of the AES-SDM tutorial, this meta-analysis was completed in three parts. In the first step, we retrieved the peak coordinates and their corresponding effect size from the results reported by each study. It is worth noting that all   Z  -scores were transformed into   T  -value using the SDM online converter. If the effect size was not specified in the study, we will use \u201cp\u201d for hyper-connectivity and \u201cn\u201d for hypo-connectivity to represent the effect size of these peak coordinates. The peak coordinates and effect values were then saved into a text file. After the data preparation, we preprocessed the datasets and reconstructed a mean effect-size map of differences between groups for each study using an anisotropic unnormalized Gaussian kernel ( ). In the last step, individual maps from each study were combined using meta-analytic calculations, which were weighted by intra-study variance and inter-study heterogeneity. We then calculated the mean of the study maps with a random-effects model ( ;  ). Here we adopted the recommended SDM parameters in the main meta-analysis, setting full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to 20 mm, uncorrected voxel   p   = 0.005, anisotropy = 1, peak height SDM-Z > 1, and cluster extent \u226510 voxels ( ;  ). \n\n\n### 2.4. Subgroup analysis \n  \nIn the current study, four types of subgroup analyses were performed. (1) subgroup analyses of migraineurs (MIG) and migraineurs without aura (MowA) to investigate the effect of disease type on FC abnormalities; (2) The five ICA studies were selected as a subgroup and the four studies based on seed-based FC as an additional subgroup to explore the alteration of FC in both methods. (3) To explore the effect of age, a subgroup analysis was performed on adults (eight studies). (4) To control for medication status, we conducted subgroup analyses of whether medication was taken. \n\n\n### 2.5. Analyses of sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias \n  \nA systematic Jackknife sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness and reliability of the main results. In short, Jackknife sensitivity analysis consists of repeated analyses, discarding one study at a time, for assessing the reproduction of the results ( ). In this analysis, we used the \u201cleave-one-out cross-validation\u201d (LOOCV) method to verify the repeatability of the results ( ). To be specific, the main analysis was repeated n times (  n   = the number of total studies), while discarding a different study each time. If the significant brain areas obtained after each LOOCV analysis were present in all or most of the previous significant brain regions, this result is then considered stable and reproducible ( ). Similarly, we applied the default SDM kernel size and thresholds to obtain the heterogeneous brain regions ( ), identifying brain areas that were not explained by differences between studies by using random effects models and Q test, H test, I-square sta  t  istics ( ;  ). Heterogeneity in the present study was evaluated by converting Q-statistics to Z-scores. Clusters showing significant heterogeneity and overlapped with the primary outcome were considered to be between-study heterogeneity ( ;  ). The heterogeneous brain regions obtained cannot be interpreted simply from the cause of the disease; it may result from clinical differences or demographic information of the patients, so the interpretation of the heterogeneous brain regions needs to be done with caution. Specifically, the results were thresholded using FWHM = 20 mm, uncorrected   p   = 0.005, peak height   Z   > 1, and cluster extent \u226510 voxels ( ;  ). In addition, funnel plots and Egger\u2019s test in SDM were conducted to calculate the probability of publication bias. Publication bias is the tendency for statistically significant findings (positive results) to be reported and published more frequently than non-significant findings (negative results) or invalid findings ( ). And the Egger\u2019s test was conducted by extracting values from the peak coordinates of abnormal brain regions in the main meta-analysis results ( ). Specifically, we first created a mask that using the peak coordinate from the main meta-analysis results, and then extracted value within mask. A result of   p   < 0.05 in Egger\u2019s test was considered to reflect significant publication bias ( ;  ). \n\n\n### 2.6. Meta-regression analysis \n  \nThe meta-regression analysis was conducted to examine the potential effects of the relevant variables on the FC alteration, in which the main variables involved were mainly age, disease duration, and frequency of attack. For the reduction of spurious relations, the significance level was set at   p   < 0.0005 as well as an extent threshold of 100 voxels ( ). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nFollowing strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we found nine studies that met our requirements and consisted of 204 migraine patients and 199 healthy individuals. The flow chart for the search and selection strategies are shown in  . One of the studies didn\u2019t report the sex ratio and another did not report age distribution. In the nine included studies, patients in three studies with medication status. In   study, the majority of migraine took prophylactic medication, whereas over a third of migraine took abortive medications in   study, patients took simple analgesics, simple triptans, and combination analgesics during a migraine attack; in   study, patients were taking flunarizine and ginkgolide for migraine prevention at the time of MRI. All the studies were acquired using a 3.0 T MRI scanner. There are five studies for ICA analysis and four studies for seed-based rs-FC analysis. The detailed sample characteristics and methodological details of included studies are summarized in  . \n  \nFlow diagram for the identification and exclusion of studies.

Main meta-analysis of rs-FC between migraine and HCs \n  \nCompared with the HCs, we found migraine patients to show significantly increased rs-FC, including right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), left inferior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Inf_L), left postcentral gyrus (Postcentral_L), right cerebellum (lobule IV\/V, Cerebelum_4_5_R), right parahippocampal gyrus (ParaHippocampal_R), and right posterior cingulate gyrus (Cingulum_Post_R). Meanwhile, decreased rs-FC were discovered in the right postcentral gyrus (Postcentral_R), left superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_L), right superior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Sup_R), right orbital inferior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Inf_Orb_R), left middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_L), left middle frontal gyrus (Frontal_Mid_L), and left inferior frontal gyrus triangular part (Frontal_Inf_Tri_L). The detailed results from the meta-analysis are summarized in  ,  . \n  \nThe areas of increased (red) and decreased (blue) functional connectivity (FC) in the main meta-analysis. \u201cR\u201d and \u201cL\u201d denote the right and left sides of the brain, respectively.

Subgroup meta-analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses of ICA studies suggested that decreased FC was still found in the Occipital_Mid_L, Frontal_Sup_L and we also found decreased FC in the Calcarine_R in patients compared with healthy subjects. While the increased FC showed some subtle difference. Increased FC was found in the right cuneus gyrus (Cuneus_R) and the left temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L) (  and  ). Subgroup analysis of seed-based FC revealed that decreased FC was still found in the Occipital_Sup_R, the Frontal_Mid_L, and the Frontal_Inf_Orb_L. At the same time, we also found increased FC in cerebellum, such as right Crus I and II of cerebellar hemisphere gyrus. Besides, we found decreased FC in the right supramarginal gyrus (SupraMarginal_R), the inferior frontal gyrus of orbital part (Frontal_Inf_Orb) while increased FC was found in the right gyrus rectus (Rectus_R), right lingual gyrus (Lingual_R) and lobule of vermis (  and  ). For the migraine without aura (MwoA), increased FC was revealed in left lingual gyrus (Lingual_L), the left superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L), right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), and left superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_L), while decreased FC was found right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri (Cingulum_Mid_R), Frontal_Mid_L, and right precuneus (Precuneus_R) (  and  ); About migraine (MIG) group, we also found increased FC in the Postcentral_L, decreased FC in Frontal_Inf_Tri_L and Frontal_Sup_L, which is consistent with the main results. Besides, we found some different brain region in MIG group, the left temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus (Temporal_Pole_Sup_L), the left precentral gyrus (Precentral_L), the left superior parietal gyrus (Parietal_Sup_L), and the left precuneus gyrus (Precuneus_L) was increase in FC compared with healthy subjects, while the left inferior parietal (Parietal_Inf_L) and the left precuneus was decrease in FC relative to healthy subjects (  and  ). For the adult subgroup meta-analysis, the great majority of the results were consistent with the main meta-analysis results. However, the increased FC was also found in the Precuneus_R and Lingual_R, the decreased FC was also showed in the right supramarginal gyrus (SurpraMarginal_R) and the left inferior frontal gyrus of opercular part (Frontal_Inf_Oper_L) in adult group (  and  ). For the no-medication subgroup analysis, decreased FC in the Frontal_Mid_L and Frontal_Sup_L was also found, while increased FC was showed in the precentral gyrus (Precentral_L) and left middle temporal gyrus (Temporal_Mid_L) in migraine relative to healthy subjects. About subgroup analyses of medication status, Clusters still showing increase FC in the calcarine gyrus, decreased in Postcentral_R, Occipital_Sup_R, Frontal_Inf_Orb_R in migraine patients compared with healthy subjects ( ,   and  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Sensitivity test for the main findings \n  \nJackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that rs-FC results remained largely consistent. After nine repeated meta-analyses using the \u201cleave-one-out cross-validation\u201d (LOOCV), as shown in  , the Calcarine_R and Frontal_Mid_L were replicated in all nine meta-analyses. The right cerebellum and Cingulum_Post_R were stably preserved in 8\/9 of the datasets. The results in the Occipital_Inf_L, Postcentral_L, ParaHippocampal_R, Postcentral_R, and Frontal_Sup_L remained significant in seven meta-analyses. Other brain regions remained significant in six meta-analyses. The heterogeneity analysis revealed significant between-study variability of FC changes in the right calcarine gyrus; this may have arisen due to the clinical differences between studies ( ). In addition, none of the brain regions showed significant publication bias based on Egger\u2019s test (  p   > 0.05). And we provided funnel plots of the meta-analysis to visualize the possibility of publication bias in  . \n\n\n### 3.5. Meta-regression analysis \n  \nAge, the duration of the disease and the frequency of attacks of patients in included studies were collated by us in current study. In the meta-regression analysis, no significant correlation was found between the mean age of the patients (available in all studies), the duration of the disease [available in all studies but two ( ;  )] or attack frequency [available in all studies but two ( ;  )] and the abnormality of FC. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis was the first study to systematically examine the rs-FC within DMN in migraine patients. The current study comprehensively reviewed nine studies, using a quantitative SDM meta-analysis to reveal abnormalities associated with DMN in migraine. We found that compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients showed abnormal connectivity of rs-FC in key nodes of DMN, such as ParaHippocampal_R, Frontal_Mid_L, Cingulum_Post_R. In addition to this, there were abnormalities of rs-FC presented in other cortical areas, like the occipital lobe, cerebellum, and some region of the injury perception pathway. The present study highlighted the crucial role of the DMN in migraine pathology, and provides a reliable reference for further understanding of its pathogenesis. \n\nIn specific terms, we found reduced FC in the Frontal_Mid_L, Frontal_Sup_L, and Frontal_Inf_Tri_L, Frontal_Mid_L as part of the prefrontal cortex, was engaged in the cognitive assessment and regulation of pain ( ). In a prior functional brain pathway study, FC of the middle frontal gyrus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were reduced in migraine patients without aura compared to healthy subjects ( ). This reduced connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the pain intensity of migraine attack ( ). Brain structure in migraine patients revealed that the gray matter volume and the folding coefficient of the middle frontal gyrus were reduced in migraine patients without aura ( ). The superior frontal gyrus was involved in emotional responses and the participative feelings of pain ( ). The left inferior frontal gyrus played a role in cognitive modulation of pain as well as memory retrieval and emotional pain regulation ( ). Several studies supported linking migraine physiopathology with the left inferior frontal gyrus ( ;  ). For example, aberrant cerebral perfusion changes in the left inferior frontal gyrus in migraineurs have been found ( ). In our subgroup analysis, we also found abnormalities of FC in other brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus of orbital part and opercular part) of the frontal lobe. These brain regions of rs-FC abnormalities were associated with migraine and other pain disorders in the past studies ( ;  ), indirectly suggesting that the frontal cortex plays an important role in pain perception and regulation, and to a certain extent, it is possibly involved in the development of migraine. \n\nIn the current study, the right calcarine gyrus (Calcarine_R), superior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Sup_R), left middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_L), and inferior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Inf_L), which are part of the occipital lobe, showed abnormal FC in migraine patients. Abnormalities in the occipital lobe were found to closely relate to migraine ( ;  ). For example, the theory of cortical spreading of depression is an important hypothesis of migraine and is widely considered to be the pathological mechanism of migraine with aura, and emphasizes the importance of abnormalities in the occipital lobe in migraine ( ;  ). Besides, the occipital lobe is now generally considered to be hyperexcitable in migraine ( ). Such excitability leads to a lower threshold for migraine attacks, and that cortical diffusion inhibition arises when certain stimuli are present, leading to migraine attacks. In other words, when patients suffer migraine attacks, the body\u2019s self-protective mechanisms may reduce the frequency and the degree of pain of migraine attacks by decreasing the excitability of the occipital cortex. Consistent with these studies, we also found abnormal FC in brain regions associated with the occipital cortex. This reflected the idea that the occipital lobe related to visual function may be an important pathogenesis of migraine. Besides, we also found abnormal FC in the cuneus and lingual gyrus in some subgroup analyses, these regions are the major regions of the visual network in previous studies ( ;  ). Established studies illustrated the hypermetabolism of the lingual gyrus and the cuneus, which is involved in the perceptual abnormalities associated with visual, such as photophobia ( ;  ). It is necessary to note that Calcarine_R is heterogeneous in the results, which may be due to clinical variations in patients between studies ( ). Hence this abnormality in FC of this brain region needs to be treated with caution and suggests that we can pay further attention to abnormal variations in Calcarine_R in migraine patients in the future. \n\nOur meta-analysis also revealed enhanced rs-FC in the right posterior cingulate gyrus (Cingulum_Post_R) and the right parahippocampal gyrus (ParaHippocampal_R) in migraine patients. Migraine patients often suffer from pain. While the pain processing is complex and it may be regulated by brain regions of DMN, such as the cingulate gyrus and ParaHippocampal_R ( ). For example, the ParaHippocampal_R participates in the abnormal processing of allodynia ( ). Metabolic abnormalities in the posterior cingulate gyrus have been suggested in previous studies in migraine patients without aura ( ), and a significant negative correlation between the gray matter density of the posterior cingulate gyrus bilaterally and pain sensitivity was also noted ( ). The present results imply that these regions may be involved in pain modulation for migraine patients. \n\nMigraine patients also showed FC abnormalities on the postcentral gyrus in the main results and abnormalities on the precentral gyrus in the subgroup analyses compared to healthy subjects. The postcentral gyrus precentral gyrus is not only a key brain region in the central brain network of pain modulation responsible for information processing of painful stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ), it has also been suggested to be involved in the trigeminal-thalamo-cortical injury perception pathway, which is related to the pathophysiology of migraine ( ). For example, migraine patients demonstrated significantly decreased FC between the right postcentral gyrus and right substantia nigra, and the altered FC was negatively associated with migraine duration ( ). Meanwhile, the reduced low-frequency amplitude of the postcentral gyrus in patients was captured in the neural activity during the migraine interval ( ) and cortical thinning within the postcentral gyrus in migraine patients ( ). Consistent with the results of these studies, the present study also found a decrease in FC of postcentral gyrus in migraine patients. Additionally, MRI studies showed that the postcentral gyrus is activated by painful stimulation ( ;  ). Increase in FC also has been found in the left postcentral gyrus in this study, this may be due to subtle differences in brain function between the left and right hemispheres. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the abnormalities of the left and right postcentral gyrus in migraine patients in the future. Abnormalities of the postcentral gyrus in patients may be associated with disruptions in networks related to pain modulation. This further suggests that the postcentral gyrus in the \u201ccentral brain network of pain modulation\u201d may be characteristically altered in migraine patients. \n\nEnhanced FC was found in the right cerebellum (lobule IV\/V) in this study, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The cerebellum is primarily responsible for nociceptive avoidance behavior. For instance, when there is an increased spontaneous cerebellar activity, the cerebellum has stronger resistance to injury ( ). Some studies have found that the cerebellum plays a regulatory role in pain processing and pain perception ( ;  ). Established studies provided increasing evidence that the cerebellum is associated with migraine. For example, studies have found abnormal cerebellar function in migraine patients, mainly in terms of cerebellar hyperactivation and abnormal spontaneous cerebellar activity when stimulated by negative emotional images ( ,  ). In terms of structure, it has also been found that the gray matter volume of cerebellar regions is smaller in patients with chronic migraine compared to healthy subjects ( ;  ). The present results further support the potential association of the cerebellum with the pathogenesis of migraine ( ). \n\nIn additional, influenced by different methods, disease subtypes and medication use, we also found abnormalities of FC in other brain regions. The temporal lobe (temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus) is significantly affected by migraine in our analyses, which is consistent with the results of previous studies ( ). And the temporal lobe is an associative multisensory area that also processes visual and auditory information have been confirmed ( ). The precuneus is a core region of the DMN involved in migraine in our subgroup analyses. Abnormalities in the precuneus have been found to potentially affect information transmission, multimodal integration, and pain sensitivity and processing in patients with MwoA ( ;  ). Abnormalities in FC of the supramarginal gyrus have also been reported frequently in subgroup analyses. The supramarginal gyrus is particularly engaged in the cognitive assessment of pain ( ;  ), and reduced pain-related activity in the suprachiasmatic gyrus has been reported in patients with overmedicated headaches ( ). The results of these subgroup analyses suggested that FC abnormalities between patients with different clinical information could be studied in detail to more precisely understand the pathogenesis of migraine. \n\nSeveral limitations need to be considered in this study. Firstly, the nine studies included in our meta-analysis differ in age and gender of the subjects, and migraine patients of different genders and age stages may exhibit different DMN abnormalities. We recommend that future studies systematically analyze data from the same age level or the same gender population. Secondly, the AES-SDM approach used in the present study is based on the reported coordinates of previous studies rather than the raw imaging data, future studies could conduct meta-analyses based on the brain maps to add more detailed information. Finally, despite our efforts to obtain information, the number of included studies was relatively small (i.e., nine studies), further research in this field is necessary to confirm and extend these findings. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nIn the current study, we included all available publications using an rs-FC analysis within DMN and performed a meta-analysis to determine the consistency and robustness of altered FC within the DMN in migraine patients. Migraine patients exhibited abnormal FC within DMN as well as some other regions associated with the central brain network of pain modulation. The present study can be considered an exploratory study that provides the primary evidence for the study of functional abnormalities in the DMN in migraine patients. The findings of this study improved our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine from a systemic perspective. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nSH, XJ, and JR contributed to the conception of the study.

Recent imaging studies have identified differences in brain activity between adult CU and controls that are more prominent in early onset users. Whether these differences are present in adolescent CU and relate to age\/developmental stage, sex, or cannabis exposure is unknown.   Methods  : A systematic review and subsequent effect-size seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analysis were conducted to examine differences in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response during fMRI studies between CU and non-using typically developing (TD) youth. Supplemental analyses investigated differences in BOLD signal in CU and TD youth as a function of sex, psychiatric comorbidity, and the dose and severity of cannabis exposure.   Results  : From 1371 citations, 45 fMRI studies were identified for inclusion in the SDM meta-analysis. These studies compared BOLD response contrasts in 1216 CU and 1486 non-using TD participants. In primary meta-analyses stratified by cognitive paradigms, CU (compared to TD) youth showed greater activation in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and decreased activation in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during executive control and social cognition\/emotion processing, respectively. In meta-regression analyses and subgroup meta-analyses, sex, cannabis use disorder (CUD) severity, and psychiatric comorbidity were correlated with brain activation differences between CU and TD youth in mPFC and insular cortical regions. Activation differences in the caudate, thalamus, insula, dmPFC\/dACC, and precentral and postcentral gyri varied as a function of the length of abstinence.   Conclusions  : Using an SDM meta-analytic approach, this report identified differences in neuronal response between CU and TD youth during executive control, emotion processing, and reward processing in cortical and subcortical brain regions that varied as a function of sex, CUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and length of abstinence. Whether aberrant brain function in CU youth is attributable to common predispositional factors, cannabis-induced neuroadaptive changes, or both warrants further investigation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nCannabis is the most commonly used illicit psychoactive drug by adolescents and consequently is the main drug that youth residing in the United States (U.S.) seek substance use treatment for [ ]. Cannabis use among U.S. adolescents increases with age, such that in 2018 6.5% of 12\u201317 year olds and 22.5% of 18\u201321 year old reported current cannabis use, and 14% of 8th graders, 33% of 10th graders, and, 44% of all 12th graders reported lifetime cannabis use [ , ]. In addition, daily use of cannabis continues to rise for non-college youth in the U.S., reaching a record high of 13% [ ]. As there are multiple reasons for these trends, recent changes in state policies such as decriminalization of cannabis and new forms of cannabis ingestion have also contributed to societal perception of cannabis as being less harmful, in turn contributing to the trends of increased availability and use by underage youth populations in the U.S [ ]. \n\nThe clinical relevance of increased cannabis availability and use among youth is related to the purported effects of such use on cognitive and neurobehavioral development [ ]. There exists well documented evidence that cannabinoids precipitate short-term and long-term cognitive impairment, both in adults and adolescents. Acute cannabis intoxication, for example, is associated with transient mood perturbations such as euphoria, anxiety, and paranoia. Recent literature also suggests that adolescent cannabis users show signs of cognitive impairment in attention, executive functioning, memory, visual processing, and processing speed, as well as a decreased general and verbal IQ [ , , ]. However, the effects of age and sex on the emergence and the clinical presentation of these deficits remain understudied. Further, existing evidence shows higher rates of substance use disorders (SUD) in adolescents with psychiatric disorders compared to peers without psychiatric disorders [ ] and conversely higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities in adolescents with cannabis use disorder (CUD) compared to non-using youth [ ]. In turn, longitudinal studies have shown that heavier and more persistent adolescent cannabis use is associated with an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a dose-dependent manner [ ]. For example, some have documented strong associations between adolescent cannabis use and an increased risk of developing psychotic symptoms and advancing towards a psychotic disorder [ , , ]. In fact, daily and high potency cannabis use before the age of 15 poses a five-to-six-fold greater chance of developing a psychotic disorder compared to adolescent non-users [ ]. Moreover, cannabis use is often concomitant with ADHD, mood and anxiety disorders in teens [ ]. As the relationship between cannabis use and psychiatric comorbidities is bidirectional, one very relevant question pertains to the possibility that psychiatric disorders in childhood may represent predisposing factors for the development of early experimentation and problem use during adolescence. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in reports that examine brain physiology through functional neuroimaging in adolescent cannabis users, examining the relationships between clinical symptoms associated with cannabis use and abnormalities in brain functions implicated in cognitive domains such as decision making, executive control and emotional and motivational processes. For instance, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed alterations across distributed brain regions during tasks involving cognitive\/executive control, memory and learning, reward processing, cannabis cue-reactivity, and emotional processing [ , ]. In relation to top-down executive functions such as working memory and attention, fMRI studies in adolescent cannabis users show altered brain activation in wide spread networks including various cortical regions [ , , , ]. Results, however, have been mixed. Whereas some studies show decreased activation in frontal, temporal, and parahippocampal brain regions, and increased activation in the parietal and medial prefrontal cortices and the bilateral insula, others show different activation patterns [ , , , , , ]. Similarly, brain networks, such as striatal reward circuit, dorsal lateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices, related to motivation and emotional processing have shown both increased and decreased responsiveness during reward and cannabis cue-reactivity [ , , , , ]. Taken together, although findings are mixed, these studies consistently show functional impairments in various brain regions, from the frontal cortical engagement in executive processing to that of the limbic system in emotional regulation, with long term adolescent cannabis use. One recent review of fMRI studies in adolescent cannabis users reported results suggesting that cannabis users may require the recruitment of more neural resources than non-using peers to achieve compatible performance on tasks across domains [ ]. The authors stipulate that the frontal and parietal lobes were often identified as key regions engaged across tasks [ , , , , , , , ]. Another important observation relates to results from a few preliminary longitudinal studies indicating that there may be pre-existing activation differences, especially in prefrontal cortical (PFC) regions, in teens who will initiate cannabis use [ ]. However, quantitative assessments (e.g., meta-analyses) of existing reports with respect to activation patterns during distinct cognitive processes (e.g., executive control vs. reward vs. emotion paradigms), severity of use and the contribution of developmentally sensitive factors such as age and childhood comorbid disorders and the implications of possible findings to clinical presentations are presently lacking. \n\nSuch quantitative assessments of regional activations that are either task-specific or consistently appear across tasks can be crucial in facilitating the early identification of individuals at risk for poor clinical outcomes and their associated health outcomes, and consequently in promoting the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. Identifying neural targets of addiction treatment in youth can be crucial in refining existing treatments and informing the future development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and brain circuit-targeted interventions [ ]. Accordingly, the present study used a neuroimaging meta-analysis and meta-regression approach to investigate differences between cannabis using and non-using youth and investigate the relative influence of age, sex, cannabis dose and use severity, and psychiatric comorbidity on the pattern of brain activation during executive control, reward, and emotion processing tasks in adolescent-onset cannabis users. We qualitatively and quantitatively summarize functional neuroimaging studies that examine neural correlates of cannabis use in adolescents and young adults using an effect-size seed-based d mapping (SDM, also known as signed differential mapping) meta-analytic approach [ ]. Coordinate based meta-analyses, including SDM, allow for the aggregation of neuroimaging data to reliably identify localization of anatomical and activation patterns that converge across studies. Predicting that the number of eligible studies would be small, limiting our ability to perform appropriately powered subgroup contrasts, we primarily sought to identify common brain circuits across and within executive control, reward and emotion processing domains that may be significantly correlated with cannabis use across different populations. Supplemental analyses were also conducted to ascertain the purported effects of age, sex, and cannabis dose and use severity, as well as the role of psychiatric comorbidity on neural activity in cannabis using youth. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nA systematic review of peer-reviewed fMRI studies was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and methods [ ]. A subset of studies from the review that included coordinate-level data was used in the SDM meta-analyses. \n\n### 2.1. Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched for studies indexed in the online databases PubMed\/Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web Science from January 1990 to November 2019 using the following search terms: \u201cAdolescent\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cadolescent\u201d OR \u201cyoung adult\u201d OR \u201cyouth\u201d OR \u201cteenager\u201d AND \u201cNeuroimaging\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cMagnetic Resonance Imaging\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cblood-oxygen-level-dependent\u201d OR \u201cBOLD\u201d OR \u201cbrain activation\u201d OR \u201cbrain activity\u201d OR \u201cbrain function\u201d OR \u201cbrain circuit\u201d OR \u201cneural\u201d AND \u201cCannabis-Related Disorders\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201ccannabis use\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana use\u201d OR \u201ccannabis abuse\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana abuse\u201d OR \u201ccannabis dependenc*[tiab]\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana dependenc*[tiab]\u201d OR \u201ccannabis addiction\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana addiction\u201d OR \u201ccannabis use disorder\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana use disorder\u201d OR \u201ccannabis*[tiab]\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana*[tiab]\u201d OR \u201cmarihuana*[tiab]\u201d OR \u201c\u0394-9-tetra-hydrocannabidol\u201d OR \u201cTHC\u201d. Broad search terms were used to minimize the likelihood of the search not identifying all relevant studies. In addition, we manually scanned the references of included studies and cross-referenced relevant original research, reviews, and meta-analyses to identify studies that may have been missed by the search. Additional articles missed were also identified through subsequent search using parallel search terms but restricting the date window from December 2019 to January 2022. \n\n\n### 2.2. Study Selection \n  \nStudies were selected if they met the following criteria: (1) included \u2265 10 participants; (2) participants were between the ages of 12 and 21 years; (3) used diagnostic criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD) as specified by the DSM (DSM-IV or DSM-5) or described frequency or quantity of cannabis use (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.) in study participants; (4) used whole-brain fMRI and voxel-wise analyses; (5) reported within- or between-subject contrasts in BOLD signal across cannabis use (CU) and non-using typically developing (TD) control youth, or brain-behavior correlations between BOLD response and cannabis-related variables in a combined sample of CU and TD youth; (6) reported coordinates from the above whole-brain analyses in standardized anatomic space (i.e., Talairach or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space) and (7) provided information about the inclusion\/exclusion (I\/E) criteria, clinical characteristics, and demographics of the study sample. \n\nArticles that studied adolescent CU within the context of co-occurring psychiatric disorders were included if studies also included active controls that did not use cannabis. Studies with young adult samples were included if they the mean age of participants was <22 years. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Extraction \n  \nArticles were extracted, organized, and reviewed using Covidence software (Covidence.org). Initial independent title and abstract evaluations were done to identify potential articles of interest by two authors (A.A. and K.K.). Data extraction accuracy showed high correspondence\/agreement (>80%) between reviewers. Abstract evaluation was followed by an independent full-text review of articles. Group discussion was used to resolve uncertainties about inclusion criteria and finalize the list of articles included in the qualitative review and SDM meta-analysis. \n\nTo facilitate exploration and interpretation of results, relevant design features and sample characteristics from each study were extracted and used to assess study quality and characterize the degree of heterogeneity across studies. \n\nTo create the final list of studies included in the meta-analysis, we took a three-step approach: Studies identified with the above search that reported coordinates of activation differences between CU and TD control groups from whole-brain analyses in Talairach or MNI space were identified and marked for inclusion in the SDM meta-analysis. For whole-brain fMRI studies that provided insufficient information on coordinates, corresponding authors were contacted via email to determine if unthresholded statistical maps or coordinates and additional study details could be provided. Additionally, we searched NeuroVault (neurovault.org) using select search terms (from above) to try to find unthresholded statistical maps from the relevant studies. These approaches yielded five additional studies, with three providing unthresholded statistical maps. These maps plus peak coordinates from published data and from author correspondence were used for the meta-analysis. \n\n\n### 2.4. Data Analysis \n  \nSDM meta-analysis procedures: All meta-analyses were carried out using the anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping permuting subject images (SDM-PSI) software, v.6.21 ( ; accessed on 21 March 2021). SDM meta-analysis is a statistical technique for meta-analyzing neuroimaging data that recreates voxel-level maps of effect sizes and their variance based upon T-maps [ ]. In contrast to other meta-analytic approaches, SDM enables original statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates to be combined, and reconstructs positive and negative effects within the same statistical maps, preventing a voxel from appearing in opposite directions, and providing for a more accurate representation of the results. \n\nData coding and preparation for SDM meta-analysis: In preparation for the SDM meta-analysis, the following data coding steps were taken: For studies that met inclusion criteria, coordinates associated with CU groups or variables were manually recorded by three authors (A.A., C.J.H. and B.R.) and cross-checked for concordance. Coded anatomical foci were then double screened for accuracy. If the studies reported coordinates in either Talairach or MNI coordinates, a text file containing the reported coordinates and the t-score associated with those coordinates was created. If a study reported multiple experiments, the results were still reported in the same text file.   p  -values or z-values were converted into t-scores using the SDM Utilities calculator, otherwise the sign (i.e., direction) of their effect was reported as positive or negative. In addition, a table was made with the study identifier (main author), the t-score used to determine significance, and the sample size for the experimental and control groups. If a study reported a statistically significant corrected   p  -value, but provided insufficient information to transform the corrected   p  -value into a t-score, a t-score of 3.1 was used, giving a conservative estimate for this effect. Studies that had no significant peaks were also included. Each experimental study was categorized into one of eleven domains based upon the cognitive paradigm(s) administered during the fMRI scan session (see  ). To prepare for meta-regressions and sensitivity tests, data on CU and TD youth\u2019s age at time of scan, proportion of female participants, average days (current frequency) of past 30-day cannabis use (averaged over the past 3 months), duration of cannabis use (years), proportion of CU participants who met CUD criteria, proportion of CU participants who were tobacco smokers, proportion of CU participants with co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD), proportion of CU participants with psychiatric disorder that are frequently comorbid with CU (i.e., depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, conduct disorder) were obtained for each study (see  ). A number of studies included mean scores from the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test (CUDIT), a validated measure of CUD severity [ ]. Mean CUDIT scores in CU participants from studies that reported it were also collected. These variables were qualitatively investigated related to study outcomes, with pre-selected variables used in a priori meta-regression analyses. \n\nMeta-analysis procedures: The main analysis was conducted in four steps: (1) Meta-analysis across whole-brain fMRI studies: SDM meta-analyses were conducted on the statistical parametric maps showing group-level effects for each study to examine for unadjusted differences between youth with CU and matched TD youth. This was first done across all whole-brain fMRI studies (45 studies) to characterize whether \u201cgeneral\u201d cannabis use effects could be observed between CU and TD youth across cognitive domains. (2) Cognitive Domain-specific Meta-analyses: Domain-specific subgroup meta-analyses were then conducted. This was done by stratifying each experimental study based upon the main cognitive domain probed and running separate SDM analyses using subgroupings of studies based upon these domains. Our main domain-specific analyses focused on executive control (16 studies), social cognition\/emotion processing (9 studies), and reward processing (8 studies) domains. Exploratory analyses investigating other domain\/subdomains were also conducted but were underpowered and should be interpreted cautiously. (3) Primary Meta-regression analyses: Next, linear meta-regressions were conducted focusing on age, sex, and cannabis use features, using a priori defined variables from each study as dependent variables to assess whether variation in these variables contributed to variance in the magnitude of BOLD signal differences observed between CU and TD youth across studies. Meta-regression analyses using mean age (years) and proportion of females from each study were conducted with the goal of determining whether BOLD signal differences in CU vs. TD youth were age-related and\/or sex-dependent. As some studies have shown differences in health outcomes and brain-behavior relationships in CU as a function of cannabis dose, diagnostic status, and severity, we conducted meta-regressions focusing on cannabis-related variables including duration of cannabis use (years), the proportion of CU participants meeting CUD criteria, and mean CUDIT scores of CU participants. (4) Reliability and sensitivity tests: Lastly, we conducted a series of reliability and sensitivity tests described below. All models were thresholded using an uncorrected   p  -value < 0.005 consistent with other SDM meta-analyses [ ]. \n\nSupplemental Subgroup Meta-analyses and Meta-regressions: Supplemental meta-analyses were conducted to examine the effects of length of abstinence on brain-behavior associations. This was done by stratifying studies into groups based upon the abstinence criteria used (ad-lib use to \u226512-h [10 studies], \u226524-h [11 studies], \u226548 to \u226572-h [7 studies], and \u226521-days or longer [15 studies] at the time of scan) and conducting subgroup meta-analyses. Sensitivity tests examining the impact of design-related factors on results were conducted focusing on different analytic approaches (e.g., studies using CU vs. TD group comparisons vs. studies examining brain-behavior associations with cannabis variables in combined samples), and population characteristics (e.g., studies that included and excluded youth with comorbid psychiatric disorders and studies restricting the sample to youth meeting CUD diagnostic criteria). \n\nReliability Analysis: A jackknife analysis was performed to establish reliability of our meta-analytic results. This was done for the primary SDM meta-analyses focused on all studies and on specific cognitive domains by removing a single experimental study and repeating the analysis in sequence. \n\nPublication Bias Analysis: To tests for publication bias we created and interpreted funnel plots visualizing the effect-by-variance for the results of our primary meta-analysis, and used SDM\u2019s Bias Test tool to quantitatively assess bias. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Systematic Review and Qualitative Analysis \n  \nThe search identified 1371 citations with 959 records excluded following title and abstract screen. Four hundred and twelve citations underwent full text review. Out of these citations, 45 fMRI studies examining whole-brain BOLD signal differences met all inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses.   is a PRISMA flow diagram depicting the search process. Results from the qualitative analysis are presented in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Study and Sample Characteristics \n  \nForty-five eligible whole-brain fMRI studies were included in the SDM meta-analysis (see  ). This included 36 studies that involved a direct comparison of BOLD response contrasts between CU youth (n = 829; mean age [SD] = 18.94 [2.01] years; 30% female) and TD youth (n = 906; mean [SD] age = 19.06 [2.44] years; 35% female) and 9 studies that examined brain-behavior associations with CU variables from combined samples that included both CU and TD youth (n = 967; mean [SD] age = 16.24 [0.25] years; 38% female). In the meta-analytic sample, the mean ages (t = \u22120.23,   p   = 0.82) and proportion of participants who were of female sex (t = 1.02,   p  = 0.31) did not significantly differ between CU and TD groups. One study [ ] examined BOLD differences between heavy CU and non-CU daily cigarette smokers and another study [ ] compared cannabis users with and without major depression diagnoses. Three studies [ , , ] sought to characterize dissociable effects from cannabis vs. alcohol on brain activity by comparing groups of cannabis only users, cannabis and alcohol co-users, alcohol only users, and healthy controls. Thirty-six of 45 studies included in the meta-analysis (80% of sample) controlled for alcohol use in their main analyses and 21 of 45 studies (47% of sample) controlled for tobacco use ( ). Many studies excluded youth based upon psychiatric comorbidities or psychiatric medication use ( ). The proportions of CU youth who were tobacco smokers, had co-occurring AUD diagnoses, and had comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, ADHD, conduct disorder) are presented in  . \n\n\n### 3.3. Meta-Analysis: BOLD Signal Differences in CU vs. TD Youth within and across Domains \n  \nPrimary meta-analytic results are summarized in  . When conducted across all fMRI studies, at the conservative threshold of   p   < 0.005, the primary SDM meta-analysis identified no regions showing significant BOLD signal differences between youth with CU compared to TD youth. Rerunning the meta-analysis using a more lenient threshold of   p   < 0.025, resulted in the identification of a small cluster in the ventral medial (orbital) prefrontal cortex (vmPFC: 16 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 0, y = 42, z = \u221210; SDM Zmap = 2.11,   p   = 0.017) which showed greater activation in CU compared to TD youth. In meta-analyses stratified by cognitive domain, domain-specific differences between CU and TD youth were observed during executive control and social\/emotional but not reward processing domains ( ). During tasks of executive control, CU youth showed greater BOLD response in a small cluster localized to the right rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC: 5 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 4, y = 60, z = \u22124; SDM Zmap = 2.62,   p   = 0.004) when compared to TD youth. Given our a priori interest in executive control we further examined this result by rerunning the executive control meta-analysis at a more lenient threshold of   p   < 0.025 and conducting sensitivity tests. This meta-analysis identified the rmPFC cluster which was significantly larger (372 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 4, y = 60, z = \u22124; SDM Zmap = 2.62,   p   = 0.004) extending to the right ventral mPFC and to the left rostral and ventral mPFC and ACC. It also identified a second cluster centered in the right primary somatosensory cortex extending to the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and insula (239 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 44, y = \u221220, z = 14; SDM Zmap = 2.48,   p   = 0.007). Sensitivity and reliability tests on the main executive control meta-analysis and results from our executive control meta-regression analysis (see  ,   and  ) showed that the majority of the variance in this right rmPFC cluster was driven by CU vs. TD activation differences from executive control fMRI studies where all of the CU participants met DSM diagnostic criteria for CUD. During social cognition and emotion processing tasks, CU youth (compared to TD youth) showed decreased BOLD response in a midline cluster centered in the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) extending across the midline into the right dmPFC and posteriorly into the left and right dorsal ACC (dACC) (dmPFC\/dACC: 64 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 2, y = 50, z = 22; SDM Zmap = \u22123.10,   p   = 0.00097). This dmPFC\/dACC cluster remained significant across reliability tests, and when analyses were restricted to only the emotion processing domain. In the primary reward domain meta-analysis, no differences were observed between CU and TD youth in brain activation during reward processing. Restricting the reward domain meta-analysis to studies reporting reward feedback contrasts (6 studies) also showed no CU vs. TD group differences. Reliability tests of the main reward domain meta-analysis showed little variance in the null result but sensitivity tests related to psychiatric comorbidity and CUD diagnostic status both yielded significant effects (see   and  ). Exploratory subdomain meta-analyses showed no CU vs. TD group differences in brain activation during risky decision making or drug cue reactivity paradigms. Results from an exploratory working memory subdomain meta-analysis identified a small activation cluster in the right insula (Ins: 8 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 34, y = \u221220, z = 12; SDM Zmap = 2.70,   p   = 0.0035) for which CU youth showed greater brain activity compared to TD controls. \n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-Regression Analysis: Age-Related, Sex-Related, and Cannabis-Related BOLD Effects \n  \nAge-related and Sex-related BOLD Effects: Results from the SDM meta-regression analyses across all studies examining the effect of mean age at the time of scan and proportion of female participants on BOLD differences between CU and TD youth did not yield statistically significant results. In meta-regressions stratified by cognitive domain, domain-specific effects of sex but not age were observed. Regarding age effects, domain-specific meta-regressions focusing on mean age of participants for executive control, social cognition\/emotion processing, and reward domains each produced null findings. Regarding sex effects, domain-specific meta-regressions showed activation differences related to sex distribution during executive control but not social cognition\/emotion processing or reward domains ( ). Specifically, during executive control tasks, an increasing proportion of female participants was associated with a relative decrease in BOLD response in CU, relative to TD youth, in a left insula cluster (Ins: 19 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = \u221238, y = 14, z = 2; SDM Zmap = \u22122.90,   p   = 0.002). \n\nCannabis-related BOLD Effects: Results from cannabis-related meta-regressions showed significant effects from variables indexing cannabis problem severity but not dose ( ). In meta-regression analyses focused on CUD diagnoses, an increasing proportion of CUD diagnoses among CU participants was associated with a relative increase in BOLD response in CU vs. TD youth in the right rmPFC extending to the vmPFC during executive control tasks (rmPF: 11 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 8, y = 48, z = \u22128; SDM Zmap = 2.81,   p   = 0.002) and a relative decrease in BOLD response in CU vs. TD youth in the right insula during reward processing tasks (Ins: 38 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 36, y = 14, z = 0; SDM Zmap = \u22123.214,   p   = 0.0006). In meta-regressions focused on CUD severity, increasing CUDIT scores in CU participants were associated with a relative increase in BOLD response in CU vs. TD youth in the right insula during social cognition and emotion processing tasks (Ins: 44 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 40, y = 14, z = \u221212; SDM Zmap = 2.93,   p   = 0.0017). None of the other assessed cannabis-related variables were significantly associated with BOLD signal differences between CU and TD youth in meta-regression analyses. \n\n\n### 3.5. Supplemental Subgroup Meta-Analyses and Meta-Regression Analyses \n  \nAbstinence-focused subgroup meta-analyses examined BOLD effects related to the length of abstinence at the time of scan assessed across tasks (see   and  ). Results of these subgroup meta-analyses showed similar patterns of activation differences at 24-h and 48-h to 72-h abstinence but different activation patterns for other abstinence subgroups with no overlapping activation foci across early, intermediate, and late time periods within the first 30-days of abstinence. CU youth with ad-lib use to 12-h abstinence had increased BOLD response compared to TD youth in the right caudate and right thalamus, whereas CU youth with 24-h and 48-h to 72-h abstinence both had increased BOLD response in the right insula and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) compared to TD youth. CU youth with a longer period of abstinence (\u226521 days) showed a divergent pattern of brain activation from other abstinence groups showing decreased BOLD response relative to TD youth, localized in the right and left dmPFC\/dACC and the right precentral and postcentral gyri. \n\nOur sensitivity tests investigated variance in brain outcomes related to study design and two relevant sample characteristics\u2014psychiatric comorbidity and CUD diagnostic status. Focusing on study design and specifically different analytic approaches: A subgroup meta-analysis of the thirty-five studies that applied a CU vs. TD group comparison approach showed that CU youth (compared to TD youth) had increased brain activity in a cluster localized to the left IFG and anterior insula (IFG\/aIns: 60 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = \u221242, y = 20, z = \u22122; SDM Zmap = 3.23,   p   = 0.0006). In contrast a subgroup meta-analysis focusing on the nine studies that examined brain-behavior associations between BOLD response and cannabis use in combined samples of CU and TD youth showed that CU youth (compared to TD youth) had decreased brain activity in a bilateral dmPFC cluster (dmPFC: 197 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = \u22124, y = 50, z = 34; SDM Zmap = \u22123.67,   p   = 0.0001). To examine the effects of psychiatric comorbidity on brain outcomes, we conducted a subgroup meta-analysis across all paradigms\/domains focusing on twenty-three studies that used standardized psychiatric interviews to assess for psychiatric conditions in participants and applied strict I\/E criteria related to comorbidity, resulting in a subgroup of studies that had CU and TD samples with limited\/very low levels of psychiatric comorbidity. The results of this subgroup meta-analysis paralleled our main meta-analytic results across paradigms\/domains yielding no significant findings at the   p   < 0.005 threshold. Rerunning this low psychiatric comorbidity subgroup meta-analysis at a more lenient threshold of   p   < 0.025 resulted in the identification of one small cluster in the left orbitofrontal cortex which showed greater activation in CU compared to TD youth. Domain-specific low psychiatric comorbidity subgroup meta-analyses showed variable effects that differed across domains. Restricting the executive control meta-analysis to studies with low levels of psychiatric comorbidity (15 studies) negligibly altered the results, which continued to show a cluster in the right rmPFC. When the reward domain meta-analysis was restricted to studies with low levels of psychiatric comorbidity (4 studies), one significant cluster emerged that was localized to the right insula (Ins: 34 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 36, y = 16, z = \u22124; SDM Zmap = 3.19,   p   = 0.0007), and showed greater BOLD response in CU, relative to TD youth. When the social cognition\/emotion processing meta-analysis was restricted to studies with low levels of psychiatric comorbidity (4 studies) no significant clusters were identified. \n\nBased upon results from our meta-regression analyses showing significant BOLD differences related to the proportion of CUD, we chose to conduct our planned supplemental subgroup meta-analysis on the five fMRI studies where all CU participants met criteria for CUD, even though this analysis was underpowered. Results of this subgroup meta-analysis ( ) showed that adolescents with CUD had increased BOLD response compared to TD youth in one large right rmPFC\/vmPFC cluster that extended medially encompassing left and right rmPFC, vmPFC, and dACC regions (vmPFC\/rmPFC\/dACC: 258 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 2, y = 50, z = \u22124; SDM Zmap = 3.35,   p   = 0.0004) and a second smaller cluster in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL: 21 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = \u221234, y = \u221250, z = 52; SDM Zmap = 3.15,   p   = 0.0008). Results were unchanged when the meta-analysis was rerun using an expanded subgroup that also included studies with samples where >70% of CU participants met CUD criteria. \n\nFocusing on fMRI studies that used executive control paradigms, three studies had samples in which all CU participants met DSM-IV\/5 criteria for CUD. Twelve of the other thirteen executive control fMRI studies did not provide detailed information on CUD diagnostic status. Running executive control domain meta-analyses in these subgroups revealed significant activation differences between CU and TD youth in the CUD subgroup but not the other subgroup. The executive control meta-analysis restricted to the CUD subgroup (i.e., the 3 executive control fMRI studies with CUD samples) identified a large cluster centered in the right rmPFC extending into bilateral ventral and dorsal mPFC regions (rmPFC\/vmPFC\/dmPFC: 269 voxel cluster; MNI peak coordinate: x = 10, y = 54, z = \u22126; SDM Zmap = 3.60,   p   = 0.0002) that showed greater BOLD response in CU compared to TD youth. This activation cluster directly overlapped with the vmPFC cluster identified in the primary meta-analysis across studies and the rmPFC\/vmPFC clusters identified in the main executive control domain meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis, respectively. The subgroup meta-analysis restricted to the twelve other executive control fMRI studies that did not provide diagnostic information on CUD yielded no significant clusters. Similar subgroup meta-analyses related to CUD diagnostic status for social cognition\/emotion processing and reward domains were not conducted as zero and one social cognition\/emotion processing and reward processing fMRI studies, respectively, had samples in which the majority of CU participants met CUD criteria. \n\n\n### 3.6. Reliability Analysis and Publication Bias Analysis \n  \nJackknife analysis for the primary meta-analysis across all studies was not conducted given the null results for this analysis. Jackknife analyses for cognitive domain-specific meta-analyses identified no additional clusters at the   p   < 0.005 threshold that were consistently preserved (i.e., in >50% of analyses) when studies were sequentially removed from each analysis. Regarding the reward domain meta-analysis, no significant clusters were identified with sequential removal of each study during the jackknife procedure. Jackknife analyses of the executive control and social cognition\/emotion processing domain results were largely preserved through most study combinations (see  ). Brain activation differences between CU and TD youth in the rmPFC during executive control paradigms were preserved in 9 out of 16 study combinations. Brain activation differences between CU and TD youth in the dmPFC\/dACC during social and emotion processing paradigms were preserved in 7 out of 9 study combinations. Results of our publication bias analyses (see  ) showed no visual or statistical signal for publication bias. Funnel plots for our two primary meta-analytic results showed symmetric distribution of studies suggesting low evidence for bias and results from Bias testing were not significant for these analyses. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis comprehensive meta-analysis examined convergent fMRI findings from tasks indexing regional brain activations within the executive function, social cognition\/emotion processing, and reward processing domains in youth with cannabis use. Such an effort allowed for identification of consistent brain activation patterns that were associated with elevated propensity and severity for cannabis use, as well as their relationships with age, sex, cannabis use features, and comorbid psychopathologies in adolescents. The main findings here pertain to identifying differences in brain activation between CU and TD participants in the medial regions of the PFC during social cognition\/emotion processing and to a lesser extent during executive function\/cognitive control but not during reward processing. A second set of findings identified sex differences in brain activation during executive control, and brain activation differences across cognitive domains in relation to cannabis problem severity and psychiatric comorbidity. Sex differences were seen in insula activation during executive control tasks and showed reduced activation in CU, relative to TD youth, as a function of an increasing proportion of females. Regarding cannabis problem severity, activation differences between CU and TD youth were consistently observed when analyses were restricted to samples in which the majority of CU participants met DSM-IV\/5 criteria for CUD or when CUD severity was considered. These analyses showed that higher CUD severity was associated with increased BOLD response in CU (relative to TD) youth, in right rmPFC and vmPFC during executive control tasks and decreased and increased BOLD response in the right insula during reward and social cognition\/emotion processing tasks, respectively. Psychiatric comorbidity contributed some variance to brain outcomes with these effects varying across domains, suggesting complicated cannabis use-by-psychiatric comorbidity relationships. Supplemental analyses identified brain activation differences between CU and TD youth in the right caudate, thalamus, insula, precentral and postcentral gyri, and bilateral mPFC regions that varied as a function of the length of abstinence and showed some anatomic overlap and some regional divergence with CUD severity results. Collectively, these findings indicate that differences in brain activity between cannabis using and non-using adolescents in medial prefrontal, insula, and other cortical and subcortical regions implicated in control, social cognition\/emotion processing, and motivation are present and vary as a function of sex, CUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and length of abstinence. Further, our results provide preliminary evidence that brain activation alterations in adolescent cannabis users with greater cannabis severity or CUD diagnoses are more consistent, more broadly distributed, and may reflect multidomain impairments across executive control, social cognition\/emotion processing, and reward processing domains in these youth. Implications of these findings are discussed below. \n\nThe primary meta-analytic results from our study yielded significant group differences in the activation of regions within the medial PFC (e.g., rostral, ventral and dorsal mPFC) across all tasks, as well as individually in executive control and emotional processing domains. Specifically, across all tasks, higher vmPFC activation were observed in CU, compared to TD. When each cognitive domain was examined separately, in CU compared to TD, higher activations were observed in the right rmPFC during executive control tasks and lower activations were observed in bilateral dmPFC and dACC during social cognition and emotion processing tasks. \n\nOur executive control domain meta-analysis identified cannabis-related activation differences in mPFC regions, consistent with prior studies in both adolescent [ , , , , ] and adult [ , ] cannabis users. Given comparable between-group behavioral performance on cognitive tasks in most of these studies, the increased rmPFC activation observed in CU compared to TD youth points to inefficient cognitive processing and suggests that CU participants may have to recruit additional PFC resources to perform comparably to their non-using TD counterparts, which has been posited before [ , , , , , ]. Our executive control results may be better understood by examining them within the context of scientific findings of studies investigating changes in brain activation across childhood and adolescence during inhibitory control in normally developing youth and youth with familial SUD (e.g., individuals at SUD risk). For example, one report by Somerville et al., 2011 focused on typically developing youth suggests that activation during inhibitory control tasks tends to diminish from childhood to adolescence purportedly due to neurobehavioral maturation and improved impulse control [ ]. Additionally, longitudinal studies in children of parents with and without AUD show that while unaffected youth show decreases in brain activation during inhibitory control tasks from ages 7 to 13, youth with familial AUD risk exhibit increased activation during the same task [ ]. Together, these studies suggest that vulnerable youth may need to recruit ancillary brain regions\/systems and expend greater effort on inhibitory control over the course of their development to perform similarly to their typically developing counterparts. By extension, this suggests that some of the mPFC activation differences we identified between CU and TD adolescents in our analyses may reflect preexisting vulnerability and also could be interpreted as a compensatory strategy to overcome possible pre-existing deficits. It is important to note that our sensitivity test restricting the executive control meta-analysis to studies where participants had very low levels of psychiatric comorbidity did not change the main results in this domain. This suggests that the variance in activation differences between CU and TD youth cannot be fully explained by the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions, and indicates that some variance in brain activations could be related to cannabis exposure or other unmeasured confounders. Thus, our rmPFC result may be better explained in relation to cannabis use behaviors or pre-existing addiction vulnerability that is unrelated to psychiatric symptom expression in CU youth. Relatedly, during jackknife analyses, the rmPFC result identified in our main executive control meta-analysis exhibited moderate study-to-study variability, and was most consistently observed when reliability tests included studies with CUD samples. This suggests that the rmPFC activation differences during executive control tasks could reflect executive dysfunction in adolescents with more severe pathophysiology, such as those with heavier cannabis use or greater CUD severity [ , ]. Results from our executive control sensitivity tests and meta-regression analyses related to CUD diagnostic-status provide additional support for this hypothesis, which warrants further investigation. \n\nAnother possible explanation for both the executive control rmPFC finding and our other findings is that chronic cannabis exposure results in maladaptive neuroplasticity in these brain regions or that constitutional abnormalities in vulnerable youth may be further exacerbated by chronic cannabis exposure during adolescence, a sensitive developmental period. Related to this hypothesis, the spatial distribution of activation findings from the present study appear to correspond with brain regions known to have increased cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB R) expression and are implicated in endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling [ ]. Given this, we posit that the alterations in brain activation seen in adolescent cannabis users are more likely to be found in cortical and subcortical brain regions enriched for cannabinoid receptors, and may occur as a result of homeostatic alterations in brain physiology following chronic cannabis exposure, reflecting eCB system dysregulation in these youth [ , ]. Incorporating genetic and epigenetic data collection and analysis into future neuroimaging studies of CUD populations may provide additional clues into how eCB signaling and related neural processes are altered with cannabis use. Whether brain activation differences during executive control and emotion processing in CU youth compared to their TD counterparts are attributable to common predispositional factors, cannabis-induced neuroadaptive changes, or both warrant further investigation and may inform the development of future brain-based interventions. \n\nFor tasks that focused on social cognition\/emotion processing domains, we found that CU youth showed less engagement of dmPFC\/dACC regions compared to TD youth. This finding was highly reliable across jackknife analyses, and was also observed in our emotion processing subdomain meta-analysis. In contrast, the dmPFC\/dACC cluster was not observed in our low psychiatric comorbidity subgroup meta-analysis, the results of which yielded no significant clusters. This sensitivity test result should be interpreted cautiously as 3 of the 4 studies included in the analysis used social cognition paradigms, which contributed less variance to our main social\/emotional domain meta-analytic result compared to emotion processing studies. Still, it suggests that some of the variances in BOLD response between CU and TD youth during social cognition may be related to psychiatric conditions that co-occur with cannabis use in adolescents. Decreased activation in the dorsal PFC in cannabis using youth during emotion processing may reflect either inherent or drug associated emotional deficits for this group of adolescents. Emotion processing involves brain circuitry and subjective emotional experience undergo significant neurodevelopmental changes during adolescence [ ]. Prior studies have shown that in comparison to adults, adolescents experience more frequent high-intensity positive and negative emotions, greater emotional intensity, and greater instability [ ] and that adolescents primarily respond to emotional cues with increased activation of the subcortical circuitry [ ]. This heightened emotional reactivity during adolescence is considered adaptive in many situations related to social group cohesion, communication, and support, but may also contribute to adolescent-specific developmental vulnerability to emotional disorders [ , ]. During the transition to young adulthood, prefrontal inputs to subcortical nuclei (e.g., amygdala) increase, allowing for better regulation of emotional responses [ , , , ], resulting in an expected increase of activation in related cortical brain regions and greater cortical-subcortical coupling. Accordingly, our finding of decreased dmPFC\/dACC function points to deficits in emotional processing in adolescent cannabis users [ ], which may in turn signify impairments in navigating the social environment [ , ]. As the dorsal mPFC is believed to support healthy emotional awareness\/recognition and the dACC is implicated in emotion regulation [ ], abnormal functioning of these regions may reflect impaired emotion recognition and regulation in cannabis using youth. [ , , ] Reverse directional explanations for these associations are also possible. For example, emotion processing deficits could alternatively predate cannabis exposure and predispose youth to early cannabis engagement and affect-motivated cannabis use as a maladaptive strategy to cope with the challenges of social interactions [ ]. \n\nSomewhat surprisingly, we did not find differences in activation during reward processing in our primary reward domain meta-analysis. There are several possible explanations for this. First, as already suggested, cannabis use in adolescents may be predominantly related to social and emotional domains and may have little effect on the reward brain system in cannabis users that do not have cannabis dependence (conversely see [ ]). It is also possible that differences among reward tasks account for differences in the activation patterns, which when combined either do not survive the statistical threshold, counteract or cancel each other. Furthermore, the lack of differences in regional activation may be accounted by individual neurodevelopmental differences that moderate the signal in some yet poorly understood fashion resulting in seemingly null differences in brain activation among participating groups. Related to this assertion, it is notable that while we did not identify reward alterations in our primary reward domain meta-analysis, both our subgroup meta-analysis restricted to studies with very low levels of psychiatric comorbidity and our meta-regression analysis focused on cannabis problem severity identified significant reward-related brain activation differences between CU and TD youth. Interestingly, both of these activation differences mapped onto the right insula and were in opposite directions, such that insula activation was higher in CU, relative to TD youth, when the meta-analytic sample was restricted to studies with limited psychiatric comorbidity, and lower in CU, relative to TD youth, when examined in relation to the proportion of CUD diagnoses among CU youth. This suggests cannabis use-by-psychiatric comorbidity interaction effects on BOLD signal are present, and further vary as a function of CUD status. The directional pattern of these relationships suggests that CU youth without comorbid\/co-occurring psychiatric conditions may exhibit dysfunctional reward processing showing hyper-responsiveness in the insula during reward feedback. However, when psychiatric comorbidity is not taken into account (as in our main reward domain meta-analysis), activation differences related to reward processing between CU and TD youth are more variable, and any effects of cannabis use on BOLD signal, if present, may be obfuscated by differences in underlying brain function related to comorbid psychiatric conditions that predate cannabis exposure and\/or differences in the neural response to cannabis exposure in youth with and without comorbidities. Furthermore, these results indicate that when CUD diagnostic status is considered, another pattern emerges, whereby youth with high CUD severity also exhibit dysfunctional reward processing but in the opposite direction, showing hypo-responsiveness in the insula during reward feedback. Taken together, these findings point to parametric variation in reward responsiveness among CU youth as a function of psychiatric comorbidity and CUD diagnostic status. As such, differences in sample characteristics may explain some of the variability in outcomes from fMRI studies in the literature. Further exploration of brain correlates of cannabis exposure in combined samples of cannabis using and non-using youth with and without comorbid psychiatric conditions are needed. \n\nOne of the main objectives of this study was to use meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches to investigate the influence of age, sex, psychiatric comorbidity, and cannabis use features on BOLD differences between CU and TD youth. Partially consistent with our hypotheses, our results showed distinct activation differences related to sex, CUD severity, and length of abstinence but no effect of age, and mixed findings with regard to the effects of psychiatric comorbidity on brain function. Null findings for age effects on BOLD response may be due to design and analysis differences and limited variation in mean age of study samples, with early adolescent cannabis users (ages 12\u201313 years) being underrepresented among studies. \n\nRegarding our psychiatric comorbidity effects, null results on the main effect of psychiatric comorbidity were not surprising given that our main meta-analytic results across studies (collapsed across domains) were also not significant when conservative thresholding was applied. Notably, the meta-analysis across studies with CU and TD groups matched for low psychiatric comorbidity did show greater activation in CU compared to TD youth in an orbitofrontal cortical region commonly reported in CU studies [ , ], when thresholded at   p   < 0.025. Additionally, domain-specific effects were seen for executive control, social cognition, and reward domains when psychiatric comorbidity was controlled for in the analyses. Specifically, the executive control meta-analysis showed no change in the main rmPFC cluster, and the dmPFC\/dACC cluster identified in the main social cognition\/emotion processing meta-analysis was no longer present when these analyses were rerun restricting the meta-analytic sample to studies with very low psychiatric comorbidity. Additionally, a difference in right insula activation between CU and TD youth during reward feedback was identified that was not present in the main reward domain meta-analysis when this analysis was rerun in a subgroup of studies with very low psychiatric comorbidity. These findings suggest that the activation differences between CU and TD youth observed in our meta-analytic report cannot be fully explained by the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions. Rather, they point to psychiatric comorbidity playing a contributory role to variability in BOLD signal in CU and TD youth, in combination with other factors such as cannabis exposure, sex, and unmeasured confounders. Taken together, our results provide early evidence for cannabis use-by-psychiatric comorbidity interaction effects on brain outcomes during executive control, social cognition, and reward processing in CU youth, and suggest that these interaction effects may manifest as different BOLD response patterns in CU youth with and without psychiatric comorbidities. It is important to note that our approach to measuring psychiatric comorbidity effects in this study was non-specific. Thus, the comorbidity results presented here may better reflect the influence of \u2018general\u2019 psychopathology as opposed to specific psychiatric conditions on BOLD differences between CU and TD youth. These associations warrant further investigation, and should be examined in relation to both \u2018general\u2019 psychopathology and specific psychiatric symptom clusters and disorders in future studies. \n\nRegarding sex effects, we identified a left insula cluster that varied between CU and TD youth as a function of sex distribution showing decreased BOLD response in CU relative to TD youth in executive control fMRI studies that had a higher proportion of female participants. This suggests that sex may moderate the relationships between cannabis exposure, executive function, and brain activity during adolescence. Previous studies have shown sex differences in neuropsychological functioning in adolescent and young adult cannabis users [ ]. Our results are consistent with prior studies in cannabis using adolescents and adults that have shown alterations in brain structure, activity, and connectivity in cortical and cerebellar regions rich in CB R in women that correlate with cognitive impairments and, in some cases, are directionally opposite from those found in men [ , , , , , , , ]. Of note, none of these prior reports identified sex-by-cannabis group differences in the insula, although one [ ] did show higher cerebral blood flow in the insular cortex of males compared to females in both cannabis using and non-using control groups. Thus, our meta-analytic report is the first to describe sex-specific effects of cannabis exposure in this region in humans. A number of possible factors could explain this sex-by-cannabis effect. Sex differences in the sensitivity to adolescent cannabis exposure could partially explain this result. There is growing evidence for sexual dimorphism of the eCB system [ ], including sex differences in CB R expression in the insular cortex, which has been shown across species. These eCB differences emerge during puberty, and may render cannabis using girls more vulnerable to adverse health outcomes related to cannabis exposure [ ]. In support of this, recent animal studies have shown sex-specific effects of adolescent cannabis exposure on cortico-striatal-limbic circuit maturation and long-term THC-related cognitive and affective alterations extending into adulthood [ ]. Our sex-related BOLD effects could also be secondary to phenotypic differences between cannabis using boys and girls. Women typically start using cannabis later than men, but progress more quickly from first use to dependence (a phenomenon known as the \u2018telescoping\u2019 effect) [ ]. Additionally, women who use cannabis report greater subjective psychoactive effects, cannabis withdrawal severity, cannabis-related problems, and have higher rates of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders compared to cannabis using men [ ]. These sex differences in natural history of cannabis onset and clinical presentation may indicate divergent neurobiological underpinnings in cannabis using men and women. The extent to which these behavioral differences map onto brain differences and predate or are exacerbated by cannabis exposure warrants further investigation. Lastly, these results might also be explained by general neurodevelopmental differences between boys and girls [ ], which could be further exacerbated by cannabis exposure. Given the growing clinical and preclinical evidence for sex differences related to cannabis exposure, research in this area is sorely needed and may inform sex-specific interventions for women and men with CUD. \n\nRegarding our cannabis problem severity effects, we identified rostral and ventral mPFC and right insula clusters that varied between CU and TD youth as a function of CUD severity and affected cognitive domain (e.g., executive control, emotion, and reward). During executive control, CU (compared to TD) showed increased activation of the right rmPFC and vmPFC as a function of increasing proportion of CUD diagnoses in the sample. This parallels our main findings and suggests that impaired over-engagement of the rmPFC\/vmPFC is associated with greater CUD severity [ ]. Activation in the right insula was also associated with CUD severity, with the direction of this effect being domain dependent. During social\/emotional processing tasks, we observed an increase in BOLD response in the right insula in CU compared to TD youth that varied as a function of increasing mean CUDIT score, such that higher mean CUDIT scores in CU participants were associated with higher insula BOLD response in CU, relative to TD youth. However, during reward processing tasks, we observed a decrease in BOLD response in this region as a function of increasing proportion of CUD diagnoses in the sample, such that a higher proportion of CUD in CU participants was associated with lower insula BOLD response in CU, relative to TD youth. This suggests that greater CUD severity is associated with insula hyper-responsiveness during social interactions and emotion processing and insula hypo-responsiveness during reward processing and motivated decision making. Together these findings across domains support a cognitive control deficit, reward deficit, and stress surfeit model of CUD severity in adolescents [ ], consistent with Ernst\u2019s triadic model of addiction vulnerability [ ]. Our results are consistent with previous studies in adults showing CU vs. TD differences in cognitive control and reward-related brain function that are more prominent in dependent cannabis users compared to non-dependent users [ , ]. \n\nIn our abstinence subgroup meta-analyses, we found evidence for distinct patterns of activation differences across domains between CU and TD youth that varied as a function of length of abstinence. Notably, we observed what appeared to be a subcortical-to-cortical gradient in activation differences across abstinence periods with chronic CU (relative to TD) exhibiting a shift from predominantly subcortical circuitry alterations during ad lib use to predominantly cortical circuitry alterations during longer periods of abstinence (e.g., Ad-lib to 12-h: caudate and thalamus; 24-h and 48-h to 72-h: insula and IFG; and >21 days: dmPFC\/dACC and precentral and postcentral gyri). These findings converge with previous studies showing state-level differences in cortical and subcortical brain function as a function of \u2018sated\u2019 versus \u2018abstinent\u2019 states and time since last use in adolescent and adult cannabis users [ , , ]. Taken in the context of recent advances in dynamic functional connectivity research, these findings could reflect distinct brain states emerging at specific periods of abstinence. Inter-individual variability in the magnitude and of the length of time\/occupancy spent in these brain states might have prognostic significance related to relapse risk during a cessation attempt, and represent neural treatment targets [ ]. Regarding the spatial distribution of our results, brain regions showing abstinence subgroup effects generally did not overlap with each other, but did show some regional overlap (e.g., insula) with brain regions related to CUD severity. The extent to which these cross-sectional analyses can be compared with one another to improve our understanding of neuroadaptive changes following cannabis cessation is unclear. This represents an important area of future inquiry that requires serial MRI scans within cannabis using individuals over time. \n\nThe existing literature on medial PFC regions in adolescents suggests that these are regions that undergo protracted development from childhood to late adolescence, making adolescence a critical period of neuroplasticity [ , , ]. Although attempts have been made to identify separate and more specific functions linked predominantly to the rostral vs. dorsal mPFC, it seems very plausible that these regions are functionally interconnected and often activate during similar cognitive processes including forward planning, executive control, self-reflection and social awareness [ , ]. Results from the current meta-analysis reveal that CU adolescents show differences in activation primarily in regions linked to executive control and emotion processing, cognitive functions that underpin more complex behaviors such as social functioning [ ]. Our report of alterations in brain activation possibly link to adolescents\u2019 behavior in social milieu but not in relation to reward processing, which suggests that cannabis use in adolescence is perpetuated and facilitated by factors predominantly related to youth\u2019s social environment and interactions and to a lesser extent by factors related to the rewarding properties of the drug [ , , ]. If true, this speculation is consistent with existing evidence suggesting that therapies targeting family and social dynamics show higher efficacy in treating CUD in adolescents [ , ] and may further inform strategies for designing a therapeutic intervention that focuses on building social skills to facilitate peer interactions and minimize substance use. \n\nThis meta-analytic report has a number of important limitations. As our main aim was to conduct meta-analyses and meta-regressions, our study was reliant on the study methodology, analytic techniques, and measurements used in each of the included fMRI studies. Many of these studies had small sample sizes and there was significant heterogeneity in design, behavioral measurements, and handling of psychiatric comorbidity and co-use of alcohol and tobacco which likely contributed variance to study outcomes. Consequently, many of our planned subgroup and meta-regression analyses may have been underpowered to detect subtle differences in brain activation with small effect sizes between cannabis users and non-users. Our attempts to address these issues by contacting authors and searching imaging repositories were limitedly successful but did yield an additional five studies that were included in our analysis. Changes in data management, reporting, and data sharing practices (especially of full datasets and unthresholded statistical maps) are needed to advance meta-analytic inquiry in the field of neuroimaging [ ]. In parallel, a consensus core outcome set (COS) of standardized measures related to adolescent cannabis use that incorporate indices of frequency, quantity, duration, dose, addiction severity (e.g., [ ]) would reduce heterogeneity across studies and facilitate meta-analytic comparison across different cannabis using populations. No studies included in this meta-analysis reported biochemically quantified delta-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) levels as an index of cannabis exposure in CU participants, limiting our ability to investigate this relevant emerging domain. This is particularly salient given preliminary data showing divergent and at times opposing effects of THC and CBD on brain activity and cognitive, emotional, and reward processing in adults [ , ]. As such, future studies should measure THC and CBD exposure from cannabis use and relate these exposures to brain changes. Another major limitation of this meta-analytic report is that the cross-sectional experimental design of most included studies prevents us from inferring causality of these results. That is, it is impossible to determine if the reported group differences in activation predate the onset of cannabis use (i.e., if these are constitutional) or if they are \u201ccaused\u201d or exacerbated by the cannabis use. Notably, this is an inherent concern in most published studies to date. However, long term longitudinal studies, such as the ABCD study, are poised to circumvent this issue and allow independent assessments of predispositions of cannabis use separately from the effects of cannabis use. For ease of interpretation and to facilitate quantitative comparisons, we focused specifically on task-based fMRI studies investigating BOLD response differences from task contrasts. Still, given our limited understanding of the relationship between the fMRI BOLD signal and the corresponding neuronal processes, it remains challenging to interpret the directionality of the findings. We chose not to include studies that used resting-state fMRI or functional connectivity outcomes in our meta-analyses. While this decision could be viewed as a limitation, it was made after closely reviewing functional connectivity studies identified in our initial search and determining that there were too few studies and too much heterogeneity in analytic approaches across these studies (e.g., seed-based vs. independent component analysis) to allow for an appropriately powered quantitative analysis. As the number of functional connectivity studies in cannabis using adolescent samples expands this will be an important next step that can build on the findings presented here and improve our understanding of brain network alterations at rest and during cognitive processes. Despite these limitations, our study also has some relevant strengths that are worth noting. It is one of the first meta-analytic studies to characterize brain activation differences between cannabis using and non-using individuals in a developmental sample of adolescents and young adults, and relate these activation differences to CUD severity and length of abstinence. In doing so, it identifies key neural targets to guide future research and theory development related to the pathophysiology of adolescent cannabis use. An additional strength is in the use of SDM meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques which enabled us to quantitatively assess relationships between BOLD response and age, sex, cannabis features, and psychiatric comorbidity in the sample and conduct sensitivity tests to clarify the extent to which brain outcomes were related to study design and sample characteristics. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn our view, this is the most comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis in adolescents with cannabis use completed to date. We conducted a series of comparisons, with our main meta-analytic results showing alterations in the activation of medial PFC regions, suggesting alterations in social cognitions\/emotion processing and executive control but not reward processing in adolescent cannabis users: in other words\u2014not the rewarding properties of cannabis per se but rather deficits in navigating social environment might play predisposing and\/or perpetuating roles in cannabis use in adolescents. These main findings suggest that interventions providing focal training in social skills and emotion regulation in adolescents may be useful for cannabis prevention, early intervention, and might target neural alterations underlying social processing deficits in cannabis using youth populations. Results from our meta-regression analyses showed differences in insula activation that were sex-dependent and alterations in brain activation of adolescent cannabis users in the rmPFC\/vmPFC and insula and in the caudate, thalamus, insula, dmPFC\/dACC, and precentral and postcentral gyri that varied as a function of CUD severity and length of abstinence, respectively. Lastly, our sensitivity tests showed evidence of complex cannabis use-by-psychiatric comorbidity interaction effects on brain outcomes across domains in CU youth. These findings help to provide a more coherent picture of brain activation differences within and across domains in cannabis using adolescents and how sex, psychiatric comorbidity, and trait-level and state-level cannabis use features influence the BOLD signal during task-based fMRI in this population. Notably, activation differences were more prominent and distributed across mPFC and other brain regions and cognitive domains in CUD samples. Our meta-regression results lend additional support to the triadic model of addiction vulnerability\u2014specifically showing that greater CUD severity among adolescent cannabis users was associated with a pattern brain activity reflecting impaired \u201ctop-down\u201d cognitive control and altered \u201cbottom-up\u201d signaling with decreased reward responsivity and increased emotional reactivity. These findings give a clear path forward for the field and emphasize the need for both large-scale prospective longitudinal studies with standardized substance use measures (such as the ABCD study) and smaller well-controlled studies with serial fMRI scans in specific subgroups of cannabis users (e.g., female CU and CU with depression) at different stages of abstinence and recovery to characterize different aspects of cannabis-brain function relationships across development. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9599849,"text_md5":"dc8358484f54427df61ba81499a2976d","field_positions":{"authors":[0,172],"journal":[173,182],"publication_year":[184,188],"title":[199,370],"keywords":[384,527],"abstract":[540,2859],"body":[2868,73679]},"batch":1,"pmid":36291215,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci12101281","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9599849","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9599849"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9599849\">9599849<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9599849  A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies of Youth Cannabis Use: Alterations in Executive Control, Social Cognition\/Emotion Processing, and Reward Processing in Cannabis Using Youth"}
{"text":"Zhu, Tingting and Wang, Zixu and Zhou, Chao and Fang, Xinyu and Huang, Chengbing and Xie, Chunming and Ge, Honglin and Yan, Zheng and Zhang, Xiangrong and Chen, Jiu\nFront Psychiatry, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nMeta-analysis of structural and functional brain abnormalities in schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms using activation likelihood estimation\n\n# Keywords\n\npersistent negative symptoms\nschizophrenia\nstructural MRI\nfunctional MRI\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nPersistent negative symptoms (PNS) include both primary and secondary negative symptoms that persist after adequate treatment, and represent an unmet therapeutic need. Published magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of structural and resting-state functional brain abnormalities in schizophrenia with PNS has been inconsistent. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis is to identify abnormalities in structural and functional brain regions in patients with PNS compared to healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for structural and functional imaging studies based on five research methods, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional connectivity (FC), the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF\/fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo). Afterward, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis by using the activation likelihood estimation algorithm. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwenty-five structural MRI studies and thirty-two functional MRI studies were included in the meta-analyses. Our analysis revealed the presence of structural alterations in patients with PNS in some brain regions including the bilateral insula, medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, left amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, as well as functional differences in some brain regions including the bilateral precuneus, thalamus, left lentiform nucleus, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study suggests that structural brain abnormalities are consistently located in the prefrontal, temporal, limbic and subcortical regions, and functional alterations are concentrated in the thalamo-cortical circuits and the default mode network (DMN). This study provides new insights for targeted treatment and intervention to delay further progression of negative symptoms. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \n[ ], identifier [CRD42022338669]. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by positive and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms, including blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition ( ), have often been found to contribute to poor community and social functioning and negatively influence recovery and general health outcomes ( ). Due to the significance of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, Buchanan ( ) coined the term persistent negative symptoms (PNS) to describe negative symptoms that are enduring, trait-like and resistant to currently available treatments. Previous studies have indicated that the estimated prevalence of PNS is above 20% amongst patients with schizophrenia, and 23\u201340% in first episode psychosis ( ,  ). Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective diagnosis and appropriate interventions for schizophrenia patients with PNS, which could remediate the substantial functional disability exhibited by these patients. \n\nPNS represents a broader concept that requires at least moderate negative symptoms, a defined threshold of positive symptoms, none or low depressive and extrapyramidal symptoms (all defined on validated scales), with demonstrated clinical stability ( ). The National Institute of Mental Health consensus statement recommends the use of PNS criteria in clinical research designs, especially those targeting therapeutic interventions ( ). However, there is currently no assessment instrument specifically designed for PNS. Commonly accepted and validated rating scales, such as the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) ( ), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ( ), Negative Symptoms Assessment ( ) or newer scales like the Brief Negative Symptom Scale ( ) and Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms ( ) are often used instead. Different researchers have employed distinct scales with diverse criteria to identify PNS, leading to heterogeneous results. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has offered a significantly advanced understanding of brain structural and functional changes associated with schizophrenia ( ). In recent years, advances in clinical brain imaging research have been made possible by improvements in the measurement of the distinct aspects of brain anatomy and function. However, the generalization of Task-based findings is limited since different groups utilized various tasks to capture a wide range of emotional states and behaviors. Therefore, for this present review, we chose to focus on task-free studies\u2014namely structure (volume and morphometry), structural connectivity, and resting-state functional MRI findings, which are stable across mental states and hence allow better comparability across independent study settings and populations. \n\nStructural MRI analytic approaches which are used to quantify brain abnormalities include voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for gray matter volume (GMV) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for white matter. The VBM technique involves spatial normalization of the MRI structural images, extraction of gray matter from the normalized images, smoothing, and finally, statistical analyses comparing healthy controls (HCs) and patients ( ). Numerous studies have indicated structural alterations in the prefrontal lobes, temporal lobes and limbic regions in schizophrenia ( ,  ) which were associated with the severity of negative symptoms ( \u2013 ). DTI is also a non-invasive brain imaging method that allows indirect measurements of white matter microstructure by recording the diffusion of water molecules ( ). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is the most commonly used index that quantifies the directionality of water diffusion in fiber bundles ( ). A recent study reported that the FA value between the right caudate nucleus and putamen was inversely correlated with negative symptoms in schizophrenia ( ), while a prior experiment found that the FA value of the anterior part of the corpus callosum was negatively correlated with the avolition score in schizophrenia ( ). The inconsistency of these results demonstrates the need to evaluate structural changes in schizophrenia patients with PNS. \n\nResting-state functional MRI analytical methods that define the local features of the spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent signal include the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)\/fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo). ALFF quantifies the intensity of low-frequency oscillations in spontaneous neural activity, which pinpoints the spontaneous neural activity of specific regions and physiological states of the brain ( ). fALFF is defined as the total power in the low-frequency range (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) relative to the total power across all measurable frequencies. As such, fALFF is a normalized version of ALFF and is less susceptible to artifactual signals in regions located within the vicinity of vessels and\/or significant pulsatile motion ( ). Although many previous studies have found ALFF alternations in schizophrenia, including increased or decreased ALFF in the cingulate gyrus, temporal gyrus, lentiform nuclei, inferior parietal lobes and frontal gyrus ( \u2013 ), few studies have been carried out in schizophrenia patients with PNS. ReHo assumes that a given voxel is temporally similar to those of its neighbors, and can be used to detect the localized functional connectivity or synchronization of information processing with little interference from external stimuli ( ). Moreover, increasing evidence shows that local functional homogeneity has neurobiological relevance to anatomical, developmental and neurocognitive factors, which could serve as a neuroimaging marker to investigate the human brain function, behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorder ( ,  ). In fact, ReHo analysis has been successfully used to detect the abnormalities of regional functional synchronization in subjects with different psychiatric disorders ( \u2013 ). A recent ReHo study demonstrated that hyperactivation in the right inferior frontal gyrus\/insula was positively associated with negative symptom scores ( ). Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is a powerful and reliable analysis method in which synchronous activity of brain regions can be examined in task-free conditions ( ). FC is particularly useful in elucidating patterns of functional integration throughout the brain (i.e., how different brain regions function together) ( ). Resting-state studies in schizophrenia have reported increased FC in the left orbital medial frontal cortex and right putamen regions, and reduced FC between the striatum and the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, which were significantly associated with negative symptom severity ( ,  ). These findings from functional MRI studies using ALFF, ReHo, or FC support the statement that negative symptoms are associated with aberrant activation or dysconnectivity in extensive brain regions. \n\nPublished meta-analyses of VBM studies have focused more on alternations of GMV in schizophrenia patients ( ,  ) or the relationship between GMV changes and positive symptoms, such as hallucinations ( ,  ). Similarly, numerous meta-analyses have shown an activation or inactivation of functional connectivity in different brain regions in schizophrenia ( \u2013 ). However, the meta-analysis of structural and functional MRI studies in patients with PNS is limited. Only one meta-analysis of VMB studies focused on schizophrenia with PNS, and it reveals reduced GMV in the brain regions of the reward network, especially the left caudate nucleus ( ). While a large number of existing negative symptom imaging studies have analyzed the relationship between structural or functional brain abnormalities and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients from a symptomatological perspective, there is a paucity of studies pertaining to the differences in structural and functional brain alterations between the PNS subgroup and HCs. Therefore, this review aims to examine brain regions that show alterations in either structure or function in schizophrenia with PNS   via   a meta-analysis of structural MRI and functional MRI studies. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data sources and searches \n  \nThe current meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA) ( ). A systematic selection of appropriate peer-reviewed studies was undertaken by searching the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for structural and functional imaging studies. Search keywords were as follows: (1) [(gray matter) OR (cerebellar gray matter)] AND [(schizophrenia) AND (voxel-based morphometry)]; (2) [(white matter) AND (schizophrenia)] AND (diffusion tensor imaging); (3) [(functional magnetic resonance imaging) OR (RESTING STATE)] AND [(schizophrenia) AND (functional connectivity)]; (4) [(functional magnetic resonance imaging) OR (RESTING STATE)] AND [(schizophrenia) AND (regional homogeneity)]; (5) [(functional magnetic resonance imaging) OR (RESTING STATE)] AND [(schizophrenia) AND ((fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation) OR (amplitude of low frequency fluctuation))]. We included studies published in these databases up to September 2021.   shows the flowchart of the literature search and eligibility assessment. \n  \nFlow diagram showing the process of identifying relevant studies. GMV, gray matter volume; FA, fractional anisotropy; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; ReHo, regional homogeneity; FC, functional connectivity; HCs, healthy controls; NS, negative symptoms; PS, positive symptoms; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; SANS, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; SAPS, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms; DOI, duration of illness. \n  \n\n### Eligible criteria and quality assessment \n  \nInclusion and exclusion criteria were adopted to screen literature. The following inclusion criteria were used to select eligible studies: (1) original articles written in English; (2) the schizophrenia diagnosis for patients was based on DSM criteria (negative symptoms must be measured by validated rating scales such as the PANSS and SANS, and must reach at least mild or moderate severity); (3) the duration of illness must be longer than or equal to 6 months; (4) used whole-brain structural imaging (VBM and DTI) or functional imaging (ALFF\/fALFF, ReHo, FC) in schizophrenia patients; (5) reported whole-brain results in stereotactic (  x, y, z  ) coordinates; (6) compared schizophrenia subjects with HCs; and (7) aged 19 years and above. \n\nBefore Buchanan developed the criteria of PNS, many researchers used different terms and criteria to identify patients with PNS, which complicated the search. To address this problem, we adopted the following exclusion criteria formulated by Li et al. ( ) to identify the relevant studies: (1) mean PANSS negative score of <19, or mean SANS total score of <20; (2) mean PANSS positive subscale score of >21, or the mean Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) total score of >20; (3) studies in which the mean positive symptom scores exceeded the mean negative symptom scores. \n\nTwo authors (Tingting Zhu and Zixu Wang) independently selected eligible studies according to the abovementioned criteria and assessed the quality of the included studies. A 12-point checklist was used to estimate the quality of each included study, based on the reported demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants and the imaging methodology ( ). Each point was scored as 0, 0.5, or 1 if the criteria were unfulfilled, partially met or fully met, respectively, and any study scoring >6.0 was included in the meta-analysis (see  ). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe research results were screened independently by two authors (Tingting Zhu and Zixu Wang) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, the reviewers (Xiangrong Zhang and Jiu Chen) evaluated and made the final decision. Preliminary screening of the titles and abstracts was conducted so as to evaluate whether they conform to the research content being explored. For articles that conformed to the research content or with content that could not be determined according to the title and abstract, the full text was reviewed for a more extensive assessment. Articles obtained after the preliminary screening were re-examined to assess whether they meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, we crosschecked the references of all the retrieved results to find any missing studies. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nGinger ALE version 2.3.6  was used for the coordinate-based meta-analyses of the neuroimaging data. The algorithm estimated the convergence of activation based on significant foci extracted from selected studies. Localization probability distributions for all foci were modeled as the center of 3D Gaussian functions. The width of the Gaussian probability distribution was determined individually for each experiment based on empirical estimates of between-subject variability taking into account the number of subjects in each experiment ( ). Gaussian distributions were pooled voxel-wise within experimental contrasts and across contrasts within a group to create a whole-brain ALE map. Within this whole-brain ALE map, each voxel was assigned a unique ALE value that represents the likelihood of experimental effects in that voxel ( ). For ALE Map creation, coordinates and cluster sizes associated with significant activation or deactivation were first converted to Talairach space using the MNI to Talairach conversion tool provided by the Ginger ALE toolbox. The false discovery rate method was employed to correct for multiple comparisons at a significance threshold (  p   < 0.01, 1000 permutations). ALE results were overlaid into the MNI 152 template and viewed using the Mango  and DPABI software . \n\nTo test the replicability of the results, we performed a systematic whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis in the meta-analysis by repeating the main analysis   n   times (  n   = the number of datasets included), dropping one study at a time to determine whether the results remained detectable. However, due to the limitations in the number of included studies involving different metrics, sensitivity analyses were performed only for the group with GMV and FC in the PNS patients. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nThe search results and inclusion procedures are shown in  . The study characteristics and results are summarized in  ,  . A total of 57 studies were eventually eligible for inclusion and quality assessment. Among these studies, 21 used VBM to analyze gray matter abnormalities and four studies employed DTI to examine white matter abnormalities and the remaining 32 articles comprised resting-state functional MRI studies (6 used the ALFF method, 5 employed the ReHo method, and 22 utilized whole-brain FC method).

Specifically, the main findings of the present article comprise: (1) decreased GMV in bilateral insula, bilateral MFG, bilateral ACG, left amygdala, left STG, and left inferior frontal gyrus in the PNS group; (2) reduced FA values in the left cingulate gyrus and middle temporal gyrus; (3) increased ReHo in the left lentiform nucleus and enhanced FC in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral thalamus, right cuneus, right PCG; and (4) decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the left PCG and reduced FC in the bilateral cingulate gyrus, left MFG and left superior frontal gyrus. \n\n### Structural magnetic resonance imaging results \n  \nIn the present study, the VBM meta-analysis results revealed reduced GMV in the prefrontal gyrus and ACG in schizophrenia with PNS compared to HCs. Several neuroimaging studies have reported that decreased GMV in the prefrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with negative symptom severity ( ,  ), which might be related to impaired self-reference processing and social cognition ( ). Our findings are in line with a previous study that reported a negative correlation between reduced GMV in the ACG and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients ( ) as well as a study that showed right hemispheric ACG volume reduction in schizophrenia with PNS compared to HCs ( ). It was previously demonstrated that the medial frontal lobe wall, composed of the ACG and medial prefrontal gyrus ( ), plays a key role in social cognitive processing, particularly in mentalizing others\u2019 intentions ( ), thereby suggesting that abnormalities in this region could lead to difficulties in interacting with others. Consequently, we speculate that the reduced GMV in the medial frontal lobe wall might underlie the increasing social withdrawal that is characteristic of negative symptoms. However, these findings were not replicated in other studies ( ,  ). These inconsistent results might be attributed to variable criteria in defining PNS as well as the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, including disease courses, and the use of antipsychotics. \n\nIn our meta-analysis, apart from the frontal gyrus, subcortical regions such as the insula and amygdala have also shown reduced GMV in schizophrenia with PNS. The insula plays a key role in monitoring internal emotional states ( ) and regulating the influences of emotion on cognitive processes ( ,  ). Many studies have reported abnormalities in the insula which were related to negative symptoms in schizophrenia ( ,  ). These are in accordance with findings that a volumetric decrease of the insula relative to controls could be detected in schizophrenia with PNS ( ,  ). Similarly, structural abnormalities in the left amygdala were found to be significantly associated with PANSS negative symptoms ( ), which is consistent with studies that found a negative correlation between the volume of the hippocampus-amygdala complex and clinical ratings of negative symptoms and thought disturbances ( ,  ). Nevertheless, the increased GMV in the amygdala and its negative correlation with PANSS scores have also been reported ( ). Considering the function of the amygdala in regulating emotional and motivational behavior ( ), it is reasonable that there is an association between the amygdala and negative symptoms of reduced expression in schizophrenia. Together, these findings might explain the various symptom profiles of patients and psychopathology, such as the loss of boundaries, lack of emotional reactivity, and poor empathy. \n\nAlterations of the temporal lobe in schizophrenia have been investigated by a considerable number of neuroimaging studies. We also observed a significant decrease in the GMV of the STG in patients with PNS. The STG is involved in emotion processing, particularly negative emotions as shown in studies of facial emotion perception ( ,  ). Previous articles reported that schizophrenia patients had significantly smaller bilateral STG volumes than HCs ( ), which was negatively correlated with the severity of auditory hallucinations and thought disorder ( ,  ). Consistent with our results, one study of schizophrenia with PNS found a reduction of gray matter in the left STG ( ). Several VBM analyses found that the PNS patients showed more prominent and extended alterations affecting the prefrontal, temporal, limbic and subcortical regions compared to the non-PNS patients ( ,  ). Altogether, these findings suggest that smaller GMV in these regions appear to be a substrate for schizophrenia with PNS. It remains to be seen whether these regions contribute directly to the pathophysiological process of patients with PNS. \n\nWhite matter abnormalities have long been reported in schizophrenia patients with inconsistent results ( ,  ), and the correlation between the negative symptoms and white matter defects has also been confirmed ( \u2013 ). The present meta-analysis additionally observed decreased FA in the left cingulate gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in schizophrenia with PNS. The cingulate cortex is a critical region in the saliency and cognitive motor circuit, with the ACG involved in the decision-making circuit and emotional processing ( ). It has been previously reported that there is a significant association between reduced FA in the ACG and avolition-apathy and anhedonia in schizophrenia ( ,  ). The middle temporal gyrus is a critical component of the neural network involved in pleasure and reward ( ). Our results align with previous reports of FA deficits in the deep temporal lobe in patients with PNS ( ,  ). Hence, the decreased white matter FA in the middle temporal lobe might reflect impairments in reward-related processing in schizophrenia with PNS. \n\n\n### Functional magnetic resonance imaging results \n  \nThe finding of decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the left PCG in schizophrenia with PNS is consistent with previous data demonstrating a negative correlation of ALFF in the left PCG with negative symptoms and withdrawal on the PANSS ( ). These observations are in accordance with the notion that a dysregulation between the striatum and PCG is associated with cognitive-affective control ( ), which might provide a neurophysiological basis for negative symptoms. ReHo abnormalities were also detected in the lentiform nucleus that is involved in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry ( ). Nevertheless, an increased ReHo in the lentiform nucleus in patients with PNS is seldom reported and might represent a protective or compensatory phenomenon. One study indicated that increased ReHo in the lentiform nucleus was not related to negative symptoms ( ), while other studies found that increased ReHo values in the right inferior frontal gyrus\/insula may reflect the severity of negative symptoms and verbal learning abilities ( ). However, in our study, we did not observe consistent results from the ALE analysis. This could be explained by the fact that there exist limited functional MRI studies investigating ReHo changes in PNS patients. \n\nIn this study, a decreased FC was detected in the MFG and superior frontal gyrus whilst an increased FC was found in the right PCG and bilateral precuneus. Interestingly, these areas overlap with the DMN, which is involved in the processing of task-independent thoughts, attention to internal emotional states, self-inspection, and future planning ( ,  ). Decreased connectivity in the DMN was observed in previous studies ( ,  ), and related to clinical symptoms and cognitive performance ( ,  ). Although several studies have reported that the DMN connectivity in the prefrontal cortices correlated negatively with the severity of positive and mood symptoms in patients with schizophrenia ( ), the connectivity between the prefrontal cortices and PCG was differentially related to social attainment and social competence ( ). The results of the present meta-analysis showed hyperconnectivity (right PCG and bilateral precuneus) as well as hypoconnectivity (MFG and superior frontal gyrus) in the DMN. These findings are in line with other recent studies which indicated associations between high DMN resting-state connectivity and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients ( ,  ). Previous evidence has also suggested that the transition probability from a state with weak precuneus\/PCG connectivity to stronger connectivity increased with symptom severity ( ), thereby demonstrating the functional significance of the relationship between negative symptoms and increased DMN connectivity in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the DMN is often hyperconnected in schizophrenia with PNS, which and might be related to the overly intense self-reference and impairments in attention and working memory observed in these patients ( ,  ). \n\nIn our study, increased FC was mainly observed in the thalamo-cortical network, including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral precuneus, and right PCG. The thalamus, which is involved in a great variety of cognitive functions and mental activities including memory, language, perception and emotion, represents a key node in distributed neuronal circuits involving various regions of the cerebral cortex, striatum and cerebellum ( \u2013 ). Individuals at high clinical risk for psychosis have enhanced connectivity in cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuits which was significantly associated with positive symptoms ( ). Similar findings were also found in patients with schizophrenia through a study of an independent clinical sample ( ). Consistent with our findings, Anticevic et al. reported a positive correlation between schizophrenia total symptom severity and all regions displaying hyperconnectivity with the thalamus ( ). In a recent study, higher cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity at baseline significantly predicted poorer long-term reduction in negative symptoms ( ). Numerous functional MRI studies have also reported reduced thalamic-prefrontal connectivity and increased coupling with somatomotor and temporal regions in schizophrenia ( \u2013 ). These findings support the theory that thalamo-cortical interactions are critical for optimal brain functioning and provide further evidence for the role of thalamo-cortical interactions in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. \n\n\n### Clinical implications \n  \nThe present findings have a few implications for our understanding of both the neural mechanisms of PNS patients and the development of the intervention. Firstly, altered GMV in the prefrontal, temporal, limbic, and subcortical regions might be the key anatomical basis for PNS since these regions were consistently identified in different meta-analyses. Moreover, patients with PNS can benefit from more thorough assessment with multiple imaging techniques, as these data can help researchers to design individualized interventions to achieve better treatment outcomes. Taken together, our findings reveal provide evidence of the specificity of the affected brain regions and provide new insights for targeted treatment and follow-up care. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThe present study has several limitations. Firstly, due to different terms and definitions of PNS, the included studies did not fully conform to the PNS criteria proposed by Buchanan ( ). The assessment of negative symptoms of patients with PNS by different scales may lead to heterogeneity of results. Secondly, the ALE methodology we used had certain limitations. For example, the ALE software could not analyze the correlation between the severity of negative symptoms and these brain regions, and it failed to provide any solving approach to analyze the confidence interval to increase the robustness of our findings. Thirdly, the literature on whole-brain ALFF, ReHo, and DTI data in schizophrenia patients with PNS is very limited, and the small sample size of available articles weakens the validity of our meta-analysis. Next, there was substantial heterogeneity among patients with PNS, including time to the first episode, antipsychotic medication, and duration of negative symptoms. Another inherent limitation of this meta-analysis approach is the heterogeneity of the results, which might arise from differences in methodology across studies, including imaging acquisition and analysis pipelines, clinical assessments, and small sample sizes. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBy performing ALE meta-analysis in PNS patients to identify structural and functional alterations, we found that structural brain abnormalities were consistently located in the insula, medial and inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and functional alterations were concentrated in the thalamo-cortical circuits and the DMN. In addition, we observed that enhanced functional alterations were detected in thalamo-cortical circuits in patients with PNS, thereby demonstrating that it plays an important role in the diagnosis and prediction of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. These findings help to elucidate the brain abnormalities specific to schizophrenia patients with PNS, which are important for understanding their underlying the pathophysiology and may ultimately contribute to the development of future behavioral, pharmacological, or neurotherapeutic treatments. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nTZ guided by XZ and JC designed the study.

{"text":"Meier, Sarah K. and Ray, Kimberly L. and Mastan, Juliana C. and Salvage, Savannah R. and Robin, Donald A.\nPLoS One, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nMeta-analytic connectivity modelling of deception-related brain regions\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nBrain-based deception research began only two decades ago and has since included a wide variety of contexts and response modalities for deception paradigms. Investigations of this sort serve to better our neuroscientific and legal knowledge of the ways in which individuals deceive others. To this end, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) and meta-analytic connectivity modelling (MACM) using BrainMap software to examine 45 task-based fMRI brain activation studies on deception. An activation likelihood estimation comparing activations during deceptive versus honest behavior revealed 7 significant peak activation clusters (bilateral insula, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus). Meta-analytic connectivity modelling revealed an interconnected network amongst the 7 regions comprising both unidirectional and bidirectional connections. Together with subsequent behavioral and paradigm decoding, these findings implicate the supramarginal gyrus as a key component for the sociocognitive process of deception. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe motivation for researching the complex behavior of deception exists not only to identify mechanisms of sociocognitive functioning, but also to further efforts to detect instances of suspect behavior. Deception is a critical aspect of criminology and forensic\/legal decision-making. Deception may be defined as \u201cthe act of causing someone to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid\u201d [ ]. Deception occurs at various levels of society even becoming apparent in current politics. Specifically, deception occurs in social settings and requires a willful decision from the individual deceiving another [ ]. Young, preschool age children are able to comprehend the concept of lying [ ], indicating the quotidian nature of deception established early on in cognitive and behavioral development. Psychological assessment of psychopathy even considers one\u2019s ability to lie, deceive, or manipulate [ ]. The evolutionary and developmental bases of both verbal and non-verbal deception have previously been reviewed [ ]. Moreover, uncovering neural substrates of deception has recently become an important area of research. Brain-based deception research began in attempts to advance traditional polygraph testing [ ]. The first report of the neuroanatomical correlates of deception used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) metrics [ ]. \n\nIn their pioneering publication, Spence et al. [ ] had participants answer yes\/no questions while undergoing fMRI to investigate the hypothesis that inhibition of truthful responses would be associated with greater ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. The researchers also investigated if the generation of a lie would be associated with greater dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) activity. Results showed that lying was associated with increased activation in bilateral ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in addition to medial premotor and inferior parietal cortices. \n\nLangleben et al. [ ] utilized the guilty knowledge paradigm to test the hypothesis that participants would activate inhibitory brain regions involved in executive control while withholding a truthful response. Results demonstrated that lying was associated with greater ACC and left parietal cortex activation, replicating Spence et al.\u2019s initial findings [ ]. A feigned memory impairment task (where normal individuals pretend to have memory loss) was conducted by Lee et al. [ ] showing that malingering was associated with increased activation in bilateral DLPFC, inferior parietal, middle temporal, posterior cingulate cortices, and bilateral caudate nuclei. Further exploration of deception and the brain was conducted by Ganis et al. [ ] who investigated well-rehearsed versus spontaneous lies. Both types of lies were associated with greater activation in bilateral anterior PFC and bilateral hippocampal gyri. The aforementioned studies consistently demonstrated converging evidence across differing paradigms that deception involves the prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions of the brain. \n\nAs noted, deception has been examined using a wide range of tasks. While there are consistent findings across many studies, some variance exists related to the brain regions involved in deception. It is likely that the neural underpinnings of deception vary based on the act of deception recruiting areas functionally associated with decision making, risk taking, cognitive control, theory of mind, and\/or reward processing [ ]. Most often reported is activation of prefrontal regions (DLPFC, VLPFC or ventromedial PFC) and ACC, in addition to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Also reported in the literature are the anterior insula, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial frontal cortex, and regions of the temporal lobe. \n\nThree prior meta-analyses have addressed the issue of variable activation reported during deception. Christ et al. [ ] used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to quantitatively identify regions consistently more active during deceptive responses than truthful responses. ALE pools 3-dimensional coordinates in stereotactic space from task-based brain activation studies. Results identified deception-related activation in the bilateral insula, bilateral IFG, bilateral medial frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral IPL\/supramarginal gyrus (SMG), right thalamus, right ACC, left internal capsule, and left PFC. Further, they found that 10 of 13 peak deception-related regions were associated with working memory, inhibitory control, or task switching, which are all components of executive function. \n\nLisofsky et al. [ ] extended the work of Christ et al. [ ] by including \u201cmore ecologically valid and interactive experimental paradigms\u201d in their meta-analysis. Lisofsky et al. based their meta-analysis on the idea that deception is both a sociocognitive and executive process, pursing Christ et al.\u2019s [ ] finding of deception-related IPL activation that was not correlated with aspects of executive control. Lisofsky et al. [ ] found bilateral activations in ACC, IFG, and insula in addition to bilateral activity in IPL, and left MFG. This network was \u201calmost the same network\u201d Christ et al. [ ] reported in their work. \n\nThe most recent meta-analysis of deception and the brain focused on the distinction between a deliberate attempt to deceive and a true false memory when not telling the truth [ ]. Yu et al. [ ] also used ALE to separately evaluate deceptive versus truthful responses and false memories versus true memories. Analysis of deceptive versus truthful responses revealed 10 significant clusters primarily in bilateral frontoparietal regions including IFG, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), MFG, insula, SMG, and caudate. The researchers stated that findings discussed in both previous meta-analyses [ ,  ] were not sufficient to warrant fMRI-use in high stakes legal contexts for detecting deception. They believe their work added the key factor of considering why falsehoods arise (to deceive or not to deceive), not simply if they do. \n\nIn the current study, we use the ALE method of coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ,  ]. By pooling 3-dimensional coordinates, ALE analyzes voxel-wise, univariate effects across the various experiments and generates a probability distribution that is centered at the respective coordinates [ ,  ]. Building on this meta-analysis, we examine how deception-related brain regions are functionally connected using meta-analytic connectivity modelling (MACM) [ ,  \u2013 ]. MACM uses regions from ALE to quantify covariance patterns (networks) via patterns of activation reported across a wide range of paradigms [ ,  ,  ]. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to conduct connectivity analyses in an investigation of deception and the brain. The use of functional connectivity in studies of deception may provide greater insight into its neuropsychological mechanisms, provided that the majority of cognitive processes are supported by various brain networks, rather than single brain regions. \n\nThe aims of this meta-analysis are as follows: first, to replicate previously reported brain regions consistently activated during deception across the varying task paradigms; and second, to determine a functionally connected brain network distinct to deceptive behavior versus honest behavior. Our a priori hypotheses are: first, that we would observe convergence in frontal and memory-related regions of the brain, specifically the PFC, ACC, frontal gyri, and SMG\/IPL, across the various paradigms; and second, that we would observe strong functional connectivity involving those frontal and parietal regions within the resultant network compared to other networks within the whole brain analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search criteria and study selection \n  \nPeer-reviewed articles published prior to August 26 , 2020 were selected through searches on PubMed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ ] were followed, and the selection process is detailed in  . The initial search keywords used were: (deceptive OR deception OR dishonest) AND (fmri OR magnetic resonance imaging). The following filters were applied to the initial search results on the database: human subjects, adults (18+), and English language. Additional databases (Google Scholar and PsycInfo) were searched via similar terms for articles not on PubMed. Each article was subsequently reviewed (first by abstract, then by full-text) for relevance to the study and inclusion of all following criteria: 1) published between 2005 and 2020, 2) carried out via task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, 3) at least five healthy (human) adult subjects, 4) peak activations were reported (  x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates provided in either MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space or Talairach; coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using GingerALE (version 3.0.2.) [ ,  ,  ], 5) a contrast was reported representing locations of greater activation for deceptive responding as compared to being truthful, 6) contrasts were calculated using a commonly accepted level of significance in a whole brain analysis, and 7) information regarding the task and stimulus material used were reported. \n   PRISMA diagram.  \nThis diagram depicts the inclusion criteria and study selection process [ ]. \n  \nAny relevant contrast related to deceptive versus honest behavior (D > H) in a relevant article was included to provide a complete analysis of reported contrasts for deceptive or honest behavior. For example, \u201cLie > Truth\u201d and \u201cIdentity Concealment > Control\u201d were both considered comparisons between deceptive behavior and honest behavior. Any article reporting the opposite contrast was included in the supplemental analysis of all contrasts (i.e. \u201cTruth > Lie\u201d).   details all contrasts included in the D > H ALE and MACM.   details all contrasts of included articles, including both deceptive > honest and honest > deceptive contrasts. \n   Contrasts included in Deceptive > Honest ALE.        \nBrainMap software was used to carry out both ALE and MACM. BrainMap [ ] is a database that archives published coordinate-based results in standard brain space from neuroimaging experiments [ ]. At the time of analysis, the BrainMap Functional Database contained over 3,400 papers consisting of over 16,900 experiments with over 76,000 subjects and 131,500 coordinate locations. The software used in the following analyses are briefly described here: Scribe (version 3.3) [ ,  ,  ] allows users to submit data and meta-data from selected publications; Sleuth (version 3.0.4.) [ ,  ,  ] allows users to search for and retrieve coordinate data and meta-data from various publications archived in BrainMap; GingerALE (version 3.0.2.) [ ,  ,  ] allows users to carry out ALE-based meta-analyses. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nALE [ ,  ] was carried out using activation coordinates from the included studies ( ) and BrainMap\u2019s GingerALE software (version 3.0.2.) [ ,  ,  ]. The primary ALE conducted and reported was based on deceptive versus honest (D > H) behavior. This D > H ALE included 45 studies and 127 experiments with 977 foci from 2,836 subjects. Subsequent ALE analyses are reported in Supplementary Material (see  ; all contrasts: deceptive versus honest, honest versus deceptive, etc.). \n\nWe followed standardized procedures for performing ALE using BrainMap\u2019s software as reported in the GingerALE user manual (Research Imaging Institute, 2013,    ). For ALE meta-analysis, a set of coordinates, in addition to any experimental meta-data (identified as suitable for the specific research question), are retrieved via Sleuth. These coordinates are input to GingerALE and smoothed with a Gaussian distribution to accommodate the associated spatial uncertainty (using an estimation of the intersubject and interstudy variability typically observed in neuroimaging studies) [ ]. A statistical parameter (the ALE value) is computed which estimates convergence across brain images and measures the likelihood of activation at each voxel in the brain. Additionally, the ALE algorithm calculates the above-change clustering between experiments (random-effects analysis) rather than between foci (fixed-effects) [ ]. The ALE value is generated for each voxel and converted into p values for identification of areas with scores higher than empirically-derived null distributions [ ,  ,  ]. Consistency of voxel activation across varying studies can be assessed due to the fact that ALE values increase with the number of studies reporting activated peaks at a voxel or in close proximity [ ]. The cluster-level inference (family-wise error) and the uncorrected   p-  value used to threshold the ALE image were both set to 0.001 (5,000 permutations) in GingerALE. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modelling \n  \nMACM investigates whole brain coactivation patterns corresponding to a region of interest (ROI) across a range of tasks. In contrast to resting state functional connectivity analyses, MACM provides a measure of functional connectivity during a range of task-constrained states [ ]. Functional connectivity networks can be extracted by functional covariances, in this case during various task paradigms. These networks exhibit interconnected sets of brain regions that interact to perform specific perceptual, motor, cognitive, and affective functions [ ]. We used the BrainMap database to search for studies including healthy subjects that report normal mapping activations that exist within the boundaries of a 3-D spherical ROI, regardless of the associated behavioral condition. Whole brain activation coordinates from these selected studies are then assessed for convergence using the ALE method. MACM then yields a map of significant coactivations that provides a task-free meta-analytic model of the region\u2019s functional interactions throughout the rest of the brain [ ]. This approach examines brain region co-activity above chance within a given seed region across a large and diverse set of neuroimaging experiments such as those dealing with deception [ ,  ]. MACM analyses resulting in ALE maps have been validated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and connectivity atlases (CocoMac) [ ] and have been demonstrated to be the meta-analytic equivalent of resting-state functional connectivity maps [ ,  ]. \n\nCoordinates of the seven peak activation clusters were identified through D > H ALE and used as seeds for seven subsequent MACM analyses. Using Mango (Multi-image Analysis GUI) [ ], binary NIfTI images of 6 mm spherical radius ROIs were created as masks around each peak coordinate. A standard MNI brain template (  Colin27_T1_seg_MNI  .  nii  ) was used to visualize the ROI masks. Separate searches for each identified peak ROI were performed using Sleuth. The criteria for each search were: 1) Activations: Activations only, 2) Context: Normal Mapping, 3) Subject Diagnosis: Normals, and 4) the corresponding 6 mm spherical ROI in MNI space. Studies matching this query were downloaded to Sleuth\u2019s workspace. (See   for specific functional workspaces for each node.) Coordinates from downloaded experiments matching the criteria were analyzed using GingerALE at minimum volume of 250 mm  and a   p  -value < 0.01. \n\n\n### Network modelling \n  \nNetwork modelling from MACM analyses was carried out using the approach first outlined in Kotkowski et al. [ ]. To summarize this procedure, Mango was used to visualize the uncorrected MACM overlay for each seed coordinate on an MNI template (  Colin27_T1_seg_MNI  .  nii  ). The uncorrected estimate of meta-analytic connectivity between each seed region and all other specified nodes was extracted and recorded (see raw values in  ). A Bonferroni correction was used to correct the   p-  value for multiple comparisons between nodes (  p  -value of 0.05\/7 = 0.00714). The corrected   p-  values, representing covariance statistics between nodes (i.e. the seed used in each of the seven MACMs) and projections (i.e. the connectivity from the MACM of seed ROI to the six other ROIs), were used to generate the edges in the meta-analytic connectivity model. Connections between the identified peak regions were mapped as nodes exhibiting one-way, two-way, or no significant connections to each other. If only one edge between two nodes was significant (i.e. a significant connection from MACM of ROI 1 to seed 2), the connection was considered unidirectional. On the other hand, if both edges between two nodes were significant (i.e. a significant connection from MACM of seed 1 to ROI 2 and a significant connection from MACM of seed 2 to ROI 1), the connection was considered bidirectional. \n\n\n### Paradigm class and behavioral domain analyses \n  \nParadigm class and behavioral domain were also analyzed using the resulting nodes from ALE\/MACM and the \u201cParadigm Analysis\u201d and \u201cBehavioral Analysis\u201d plugins for Mango [ ]. Paradigm class is a category in BrainMap classifying what experimental task was used. Behavioral domain is a BrainMap category classifying the mental operations likely to be isolated by a given contrast. Laird et al. [ ] found that these two fields provide the most salient information for ascertaining a brain region\u2019s function. These analyses assume that the spatial distribution of activation foci derived from BrainMap\u2019s database for each behavioral sub-domain or paradigm class represents that sub-domain\u2019s (or class\u2019s) true probability distribution function [ ].   Z  -scores are generated for observed-minus-expected values for each behavioral sub-domain or paradigm class. Lancaster et al. [ ] state that only   z  -scores greater than or equal to 3.0 are significant (comparable to a   p  -value of 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). The identification of paradigm class and behavioral domain associated with nodes aids interpretation of connectivity reported via MACM. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE results for deceptive versus honest behavior \n  \n45 studies, 977 foci and 2,836 subjects were included in the ALE meta-analysis to demonstrate activation associated with deceptive versus honest behavior. The D > H ALE revealed seven significant clusters ( ). The nearest grey matter associated with each cluster are the left and right insula (L Ins, R Ins), left superior frontal gyrus (L SFG), left and right supramarginal gyrus (L SMG, R SMG), and left and right medial frontal gyrus (L MFG, R MFG).   depicts activation of each of the 7 clusters. \n   Deceptive > Honest ALE results.  \nActivation is visualized in Mango on a standard MNI brain template (  A  : horizontal slice,   B  : coronal slice; FWE < 0.001, p < 0.001, at 5,000 permutations). Z and Y values correspond to the brain slice label. The activation color (red-yellow) corresponds to the ALE value listed in    . Left and right are accurately depicted. The ALE image can be found on Neurovault ( ). \n     Deceptive > Honest ALE results.        \n\n### MACM results for deceptive versus honest behavior \n  \nMACM was used to examine the extent of connectivity between the seven clusters identified in the ALE exhibiting greater activation during deception than honest behavior. A unique MACM was carried out for each individual ROI, resulting with seven independent seed to voxel connectivity maps. (See   for slices of each individual map.) Bolded lines ( ) represent bidirectionality, indicating that the variance in two nodes is predictive of each other. Arrows ( ) represent unidirectionality, indicating that variance in one node is predictive of variance in another, but not vice versa. The matrix results are shown in   (raw scores:  ). \n   Meta-analytic model of connectivity between Deceptive > Honest peak regions.  \n A  : horizontal slice and   B  : coronal slice.

All paradigm classes at a   z  -score of > = 2.0 are reported in  . The left insula has the strongest association with the paradigm class \u201cReward\u201d (  z   = 4.564). The left SFG has the strongest association with the paradigm class of \u201cFinger Tapping\/Button Press\u201d (  z   = 4.905). The right insula has the highest association with the paradigm class \u201cPain Monitor\/Discrimination\u201d (  z   = 5.550). These paradigm class analysis results indicate significant associations of the left and right insula with reward paradigms, in addition to significant associations of left SFG and right insula to semantic discrimination and pain discrimination, respectively. \n  \n Z  -scores of (A) paradigm class or (B) behavioral domain analyses.

Only paradigm classes or behavioral sub-domains passing the threshold of   z   > = 3.0 are depicted. \n  \nSubsequent behavioral domain analysis of the seven nodes from ALE\/MACM with the \u201cBehavioral Analysis\u201d Mango plugin [ ] identified 15 significant sub-domains.   indicates behavioral sub-domains (within one of five domains) for which the observed regional number of experiments was higher than expected (compared with the distribution across the BrainMap database). All sub-domains at a   z  -score of > = 2.0 are reported in  . The left insula has the strongest association with sub-domains of \u201cCognition\u201d, including \u201cLanguage (Speech)\u201d (  z   = 6.097), \u201cLanguage (Semantics)\u201d (  z   = 6.037), \u201cAttention\u201d (  z   = 5.837), and \u201cReasoning\u201d (  z   = 5.693). The left SFG also has strong associations with sub-domains of \u201cCognition\u201d, including \u201cAttention\u201d (  z   = 6.78), \u201cMemory (Working)\u201d (  z   = 5.829), and \u201cLanguage (Semantics)\u201d (  z   = 5.335). The right insula has strongest associations with \u201cAttention\u201d of the \u201cCognition\u201d domain (  z   = 6.421) and \u201cSomesthesis (Pain)\u201d of the \u201cPerception\u201d domain (  z   = 5.417). The right MFG has one significant association with the \u201cAttention\u201d sub-domain of \u201cCognition\u201d (z = 3.124). These results indicate that the bilateral insula, L SFG, and R MFG are mainly associated with behaviors regarding cognition. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the presented series of meta-analyses, we conducted activation likelihood estimation and meta-analytic connectivity modelling in addition to subsequent paradigm class and behavioral domain analyses using reported neuroimaging findings for deception tasks. \n\n### Regions associated with deception \n  \nThe findings of this study align well with previously reported findings while presenting new information regarding functional connectivity of deception-related brain regions. Results from the ALE identified seven brain regions significantly activated during deception, including bilateral insula, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus. These regions match regions reported in previous meta-analyses: BA 6 (SFG), BA 40 (IPL or SMG), BA 6 (MFG). Our first hypothesis was supported in that the study replicates findings of prefrontal (BA 9 and 13) and memory-related (BA 6) regional activation during deception. Various additional regions were consistently active, most likely resulting from the variety of paradigms included in ALE. Interestingly, the regions that we found to be significantly active during deception tasks matched those reported in the most recent meta-analysis [ ]. Here we discuss each region\u2019s functional significance, relationship to sociocognitive behaviors of deception, and make comparisons to existing deception literature. \n\n#### Insula \n  \nRecent studies using ecologically valid paradigms involved more of the participants\u2019 emotions as evidenced by consistent activation in the insula and other emotion-related brain regions [ ]. These recent studies have added evidence that the insula is part of a reflexive, automatic system of social cognition. In Baumgartner et al.\u2019s study [ ], results demonstrated increased activation of the anterior insula in dishonest subjects compared to honest subjects. Further, the researchers state that subjects in the dishonest group who later intended to break promises demonstrate increased bilateral frontoinsular cortex activation during that (promise) stage. Proposed reasons for insular activity in dishonesty or deception include insular activation during aversive emotional experiences associated with unfairness, threat of punishment, and anticipation of negative\/unknown emotional events [ ]. The researchers also state that aversive experiences may include \u201cguilty conscience\u201d towards the other individual who will eventually be misled. \n\n\n#### Superior frontal gyrus \n  \nThe SFG has been associated with cognitive processes such as working memory, response inhibition, task switching, visual attention, and theory of mind [ ]. More specific to deception behavior, Chen et al. [ ] reported overlapping SFG activation between feigned short-term and long-term memory. This finding supports the role of SFG in executive function aspects of feigned memory impairment, whether short-term or long-term memory [ ]. In addition, Yin et al. [ ] reported that both spontaneous and instructed lying coactivate the SFG among other regions. Researchers also report the involvement of SFG in identity faking aspects of deception behavior [ ]. Since SFG has implications with working memory, Ding et al. [ ] state that both SFG and working memory functions play a role in deceptively faking one\u2019s identity. \n\n\n#### Supramarginal gyrus \n  \nThe supramarginal gyrus lies within the inferior parietal lobule, an area commonly associated with deception since the pioneering neuroimaging study by Spence et al. [ ]. Instructed deception has been shown to involve the IPL [ ]. Various other studies have associated the inferior parietal regions with the execution of deception. Ito et al. [ ] reported increased SMG activity in the execution phase of a deception task compared with telling the truth. Kireev et al. [ ] found a similar result in that a network including the IPL demonstrated increased activation during deliberate deception processing\/execution. In addition, Ofen et al. [ ] found similar activation of parietal regions during the execution of a deceptive response. Potential reasons for the involvement of SMG\/IPL in executing deception include parietal regions supporting executive functioning (i.e. working memory) [ ] and cognitive control processes as they are commonly activated during tasks that require high levels of cognitive control [ ]. Further evidence of this comes from a study where activation of parietal regions was associated with intentional feigned responses and not unintentional errors [ ]. \n\nIt has also been suggested that SMG\/IPL is engaged when detecting salient stimuli and processing judgements regarding deception [ ] as well as probability monitoring and response counting [ ]. Browndyke et al. [ ] state that these sociocognitive aspects may allow the deceiver to lie less obviously, or better feign an impairment. Further, the study participants subsequently reported attempts to gauge the proportion of their true versus feigned responses in order to create less detectable deception [ ]. Along this line of thought, the parietal regions (SMG\/IPL) have been associated with theory of mind [ ]. Theory of mind necessitates the ability to understand and predict another individual\u2019s behavior (via inferences regarding mental state, intentions, feelings, expectations, beliefs, or knowledge) and to cognitively represent one\u2019s own mental state [ ]. Evidence of the association between SMG and the sociocognitive process of theory of mind includes the activation of SMG in pro-social lying that was deemed morally appropriate [ ] and the recruitment of IPL regions for top-down modulation of emotional responses [ ]. \n\n\n#### Medial frontal gyrus \n  \nFrontal (namely prefrontal) regions have markedly been reported in association with deception tasks and behaviors. Sun et al. [ ] demonstrated that lies elicited stronger MFG activation compared to truth. Moreover, Bhatt et al. [ ] state that MFG may play a role in familiarity-based deception (rather than familiarity or deception individually). Liu et al. [ ] stated that (left) MFG seemed to be primarily responsible for the falsification process in conditional proposition testing. The researchers noted the association between MFG and working memory and higher-level control processes (i.e. coordinating widely distributed cognitive and emotional reactions, learning new rules, and processing logical relationships) [ ]. Further, involvement of frontal lobe regions is consistent with the conceptualization of deception as an executive control incentive task [ ,  ]. \n\n\n\n### Connectivity analyses \n  \nOur second hypothesis was also supported by the involvement of the prefrontal and memory-related regions in the connectivity model. The connectivity modelling used in the current meta-analysis, which adds new information regarding deception-related brain regions, has not been done in this realm of research before to our knowledge. MACM of brain regions active during deception, identified via ALE, show that these regions are also highly connected to each other. Each of the seven nodes were involved in at least one significant bidirectional connection. Interestingly, only the seed nodes for left and right supramarginal gyri projected to other nodes (in other words, were involved in unidirectional connections). All seven maps are overlaid onto a template brain in   to further demonstrate convergence at the L and R SMG. Thus, activation of SMG is likely predictive of activation in bilateral insula, left SFG, or bilateral MFG (respectively). This means that the bilateral SMG must engage with other regions to engage in deception tasks, however those other regions are not required for deception. Other regions identified in our deception ALE (i.e. bilateral insula, left SFG, bilateral MFG) likely have supportive roles in cognitive aspects of the tasks. This may well be the case since, in order to lie, an individual must construct new information while withholding factual information during a social interaction with another individual [ ]. The important role SMG plays in deception is further supported by our paradigm class and behavioral domain findings. The bilateral SMG did not elicit significant (  z  -score > = 3.0) paradigm class or behavioral domain information that would indicate SMG involvement in other cognitive\/task-based aspects in the current meta-analysis. Together, the connectivity model, paradigm class, and behavioral domain findings of the current study could implicate the supramarginal gyrus as a key region in a brain network that allows individuals to successfully deceive one another. \n\n\n### Importance of neuroimaging deception and its application \n  \nA major motivation behind the study of deception is the ability to reliably detect when a given individual is being truthful or is lying [ ]. The law often concerns itself with this phenomenon as it contributes to judgements regarding human behavior. Untruthful statements are possible and commonly made by plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses alike [ ]. Assessing the veracity of statements made by individuals inside and outside of the courtroom is a crucial component of just and efficient legal resolution [ ]. Legal actors increasingly offer neuroscientific evidence during litigation and policy discussions. Similarly, cognitive neuroscientists aim to address important problems confronted by the law by explaining neuropsychological mechanisms that give rise to thoughts and actions [ ]. The utility of neuroscientific evidence depends both on the accuracy of the neuroscience as well as the appropriate usage by legal actors. Though specific courtroom scenarios deal with individuals, group-level studies are needed as fMRI-based evidence will be used to establish the reliability of instances related to any deception apparent in court [ ]. It is important to note that the reliability of task-based fMRI has been assessed recently and demonstrated, on average, a test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.397. This is low in comparison to recommendations for \u201cgood reliability\u201d [ ]. It seems that reliability regarding fMRI depends on experimental design, the nature of measures used, and the amount of data obtained [ ]. In general, these necessary group-level studies must ensure sufficient reliability, by utilizing potentially smaller amounts of optimal data rather than larger amounts of suboptimal data, to allow assumptions at the individual level [ ]. Accurate detection of deception in humans is of particular importance in ensuring valid and just forensic practices and legal proceedings. \n\nWhere the legal system and neuroscience overlap is in the attempts to utilize neuroscientific advances to yield better answers to legally relevant questions that have had historically unsatisfying solutions [ ]. Some questions include whether or not an individual is responsible for their behavior, if an individual is competent, what an individual remembers, and pertaining to the current meta-analysis, if an individual is lying. Legal cases from the last decade or so have involved methods of brain-based lie detection, brain-based memory detection (wherein under controlled experimental conditions memory states may be detected using fMRI data), detection and classification of \u201cculpable mental states\u201d including purposeful, knowing, reckless, and negligent (based on the \u201cModel Penal Code\u201d), and investigations of the decision-making processes of, not only if an individual is criminally liable, but also how to then punish that individual in an unbiased and just fashion [ ]. However, all of these aspects pertaining to criminal law have their apparent downfalls (for more on this see [ ]). Those at the intersection of neuroscience and the law (commonly called \u201cneurolaw\u201d) focus on non-criminal law as well: the aging brain in regard to wills, trusts, and estates; disability and social security laws in association with the neuroscience of pain; similarly, brain injury cases and medical malpractice; and more. \n\nNeuroimaging has been used in legal proceedings since the early twentieth century, with use of electroencephalography (EEG) appearing in the 1940s, computed tomography (CT) appearing in 1981, positron emission tomography (PET) appearing in 1992, and fMRI not long after [ ]. Over the last two decades alone, the use of neuroscientific evidence in general and neuroimaging-based evidence specifically has increased tremendously in the United States [ ]. Jones [ ] has identified seven categories for the applications of neuroscience to the legal setting: buttressing, detecting, sorting, challenging, intervening, explaining, and predicting. We believe this meta-analytic view of deception fits into the detecting and explaining categories, wherein neuroscience is used to gain otherwise elusive insights and to shed light on not well understood phenomenon. Our work contributes to efforts of detecting deception-based activity in the functional brain rather than the activity of the nervous system (i.e. heart rate\/blood pressure, respiration, skin conductivity, etc. used in polygraphy). Benefits of this have been reviewed at length [ ]. In agreement with what is written in a recent review [ ], we believe that there is a common ground where the long-term effects of neuroscience on law are not overstated but we can appropriately consider that neuroscience has something useful to offer the legal system. \n\n\n### Challenges and limitations \n  \nSpence et al. [ ] predicted the problems that have persisted in the neuroimaging literature of deception: 1) ecological validity: the experiments generally include compliant subjects who are not involved in high-stakes situations that pertain to forensics or the legal system (thus, these studies are unable to address how the brain functions when someone is intentionally lying to cause harm or deceive for a known purpose and may not extrapolate to circumstances wherein deception is an automatic process driving malevolent behavior) [ ]; 2) experimental design: some experiments have simple designs of simulated deception that facilitate simple contrasts (lie > truth) which may not cohere in the real world (where there exists imprecise information, mixed motives, etc.); 3) statistical power: there may well be a range of individual differences that would make it premature to extrapolate from neuroimaging data to an individual suspect in a courtroom. The over-arching issue encapsulating the points above involves the differences between instructed and natural deception. Specifically, when a subject is told to deceive, lie, or be untruthful by the experimenter they are not faced with the decision to be truthful or benefit in some way from the lie [ ]. Speaking to the first and second problems raised above, instructed deception does not elicit the same high-stakes situation involving motive, circumstance, and other factors that exist in the real world (natural deception). However, these studies still contribute to the growing knowledge base of deceptive behavior in various settings. \n\nThe current meta-analysis regarding brain regions active during deceptive versus honest behavior addresses the above problems to some degree by including ecologically valid studies in our total pool and drawing results from a large, heterogenous sample. More recently, studies and their respective paradigms have attempted to evoke \u201crealistic social exchanges\u201d by allowing participants the free choice to break or keep a promise, mitigating to some degree the previous work. These ecologically valid studies were included in our current meta-analyses (see the Instructed or Natural Deception column in  ). Also, the nature of coordinate-based meta-analyses that include task-based studies allows results to be drawn from a large, heterogeneous sample. This takes into account paradigms that may or may not involve compliant subjects in somewhat realistic circumstances, and that may or may not include \u201csimple contrasts\u201d, as long as the inclusion criteria are met. Regarding statistical power, the recommended number of included experiments has been met in the current meta-analysis (20 experiments in order to achieve sufficient statistical power) [ ]. \n\nIn general, the use of correlative measures between an fMRI task and a study participant\u2019s neurophysiological signals to determine an individual\u2019s fate in the justice system is widely debated and creates challenges that will need to be addressed in the future. A main challenge to the introduction of neuroscientific evidence (specific to the individual(s) involved) is the fact that collection of fMRI data is typically well after the instance that led to the legal proceeding took place. Additionally, group-level data often used for comparison involves healthy adults potentially restricted by age, handedness, gender, or criteria that may not match up with the individual subject to the legal proceeding. Furthermore, it is difficult to know whether the neuroimaging data from group studies resembles true deceptive behavior or is simply a byproduct of conducting a cognitive task in the fMRI scanner. Standards have not yet been set for the real-life use of brain-based lie detection (mentioned above), as the consensus remains that (even in its general application) fMRI may serve as a better research topic than legal tool. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nDue to the previously noted association of supramarginal gyrus and theory of mind aspects of deception, a potential next step could be analyzing regions found in the current study with regions involved in theory of mind. Deception is related to theory of mind, as deceiving another individual necessitates knowledge of the victims\u2019 thoughts and beliefs as well as analysis of responses to the lie made in the social context [ ]. Thus, follow-up meta-analyses can be conducted and subsequently compared to the findings of the current study to determine if overlapping regional activation exists. Of particular interest in such a comparison would be the SMG and SFG which have been associated with theory of mind aspects of deception. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current study utilized activation likelihood estimation and the novel approaches of meta-analytic connectivity analysis, paradigm class analysis, and behavioral domain analysis to investigate neuroanatomical correlates of deception and their functional connectivity. Across the varying studies involving differences in context of deception, motivation for deception, response modality, and more, we found significant activation in the insula, superior and medial frontal gyri, and supramarginal gyrus. Moreover, the connectivity model and paradigm\/behavioral analyses demonstrate the key role that the supramarginal gyrus has in the brain network associated with deceptive acts and behaviors. An understanding of the neurobiological aspects of deception has implications for subsequent theory of mind and social cognition research in addition to forensic\/legal analyses of guilt and responsibility. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8386837,"text_md5":"73d0beb84dcbc441950549fe0f7da553","field_positions":{"authors":[0,105],"journal":[106,114],"publication_year":[116,120],"title":[131,202],"keywords":[216,216],"abstract":[229,1319],"body":[1328,43910]},"batch":1,"pmid":34432808,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0248909","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8386837","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8386837"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8386837\">8386837<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8386837  Meta-analytic connectivity modelling of deception-related brain regions"}
{"text":"Crepaldi, Davide and Berlingeri, Manuela and Cattinelli, Isabella and Borghese, Nunzio A. and Luzzatti, Claudio and Paulesu, Eraldo\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2013\n\n# Title\n\nClustering the lexicon in the brain: a meta-analysis of the neurofunctional evidence on noun and verb processing\n\n# Keywords\n\nneuroimaging\nnoun-verb dissociation\nmeta-analysis\nclustering algorithm\ntask demand\nleft inferior frontal gyrus\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAlthough it is widely accepted that nouns and verbs are functionally independent linguistic entities, it is less clear whether their processing recruits different brain areas. This issue is particularly relevant for those theories of lexical semantics (and, more in general, of cognition) that suggest the embodiment of abstract concepts, i.e., based strongly on perceptual and motoric representations. This paper presents a formal meta-analysis of the neuroimaging evidence on noun and verb processing in order to address this dichotomy more effectively at the anatomical level. We used a hierarchical clustering algorithm that grouped fMRI\/PET activation peaks solely on the basis of spatial proximity. Cluster specificity for grammatical class was then tested on the basis of the noun-verb distribution of the activation peaks included in each cluster. Thirty-two clusters were identified: three were associated with nouns across different tasks (in the right inferior temporal gyrus, the left angular gyrus, and the left inferior parietal gyrus); one with verbs across different tasks (in the posterior part of the right middle temporal gyrus); and three showed verb specificity in some tasks and noun specificity in others (in the left and right inferior frontal gyrus and the left insula). These results do not support the popular tenets that verb processing is predominantly based in the left frontal cortex and noun processing relies specifically on temporal regions; nor do they support the idea that verb lexical-semantic representations are heavily based on embodied motoric information. Our findings suggest instead that the cerebral circuits deputed to noun and verb processing lie in close spatial proximity in a wide network including frontal, parietal, and temporal regions. The data also indicate a predominant\u2014but not exclusive\u2014left lateralization of the network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFollowing the seminal report of a dyslexic patient who was predominantly impaired in reading verbs compared to nouns (Holmes et al.,  ), substantial evidence has been accumulated which supports the hypothesis that noun and verb representations are functionally independent in the human cognitive system. This evidence sources primarily from neuropsychological studies describing various patients whose behavior collectively supports the case for double noun-verb dissociation (Miceli et al.,  ; Hillis and Caramazza,  ; Berndt et al.,  ; Luzzatti et al.,  ; Crepaldi et al.,  ), but is also confirmed by several psycholinguistic studies in which nouns and verbs give rise to different pattern of priming effects (Sereno,  ; Mahon et al.,  ; Crepaldi,  ). \n\nThe functional dissociation between nouns and verbs raised the question as to whether the neural underpinnings of these grammatical classes are anatomically segregated in separate brain regions. This issue was initially investigated in anatomo-correlational studies, which altogether revealed a somewhat controversial picture. Damasio and Tranel ( ), for example, reported the case of two patients who had suffered from temporal damage and whose ability to retrieve nouns was specifically impaired, and of one patient who had suffered a damage to the posterior segment of the inferior frontal gyrus and whose ability to retrieve verbs was impaired. In spite of some replication of this fronto-temporal pattern (Daniele et al.,  ), these results do not fit easily with what has been reported in several other anatomo-clinical studies. For example, Aggujaro et al. ( ) studied lesion localization in a sample of 20 aphasic patients suffering from disproportionate impairment of either nouns or verbs: they found no verb-impaired patient with a pure frontal damage, and several cases with isolated left posterior-temporal and inferior-parietal brain damage. Converging data arise from a study by De Renzi and Di Pellegrino ( ), who described an aphasic patient with vast frontal brain damage, but no specific problems in retrieving verbs. \n\nData from functional neuroimaging studies are also rather unclear as to whether the neural structures responsible for noun and verb processing are anatomically segregated in the brain. In one of the first neuroimaging investigations about this issue, Warburton et al. ( ) compared the cerebral activation related to nouns and verbs in a verbal fluency task: they concluded that the two grammatical classes recruit the same neural circuits, but verbs elicit stronger activations in these areas than nouns. In spite of early replications of these findings (Perani et al.,  ), several other studies have found that nouns and verbs do recruit spatially segregated brain regions or, conversely that the two grammatical classes elicit similarly strong activations in the same areas. Saccuman et al. ( ) for example, working with an fMRI picture naming study, found verb-specific activation in the left intra-parietal sulcus, in the right fusiform gyrus, and in the left cerebellum, while nouns determined an increased BOLD signal in the right cuneus and the right posterior cingulate cortex. However, Tyler et al. ( ) reported diametrically opposing results in a lexical decision and a semantic categorization task; in their study none of the cortical areas (with the sole exception of the left BA 20\/37) was activated in direct verbs-minus-nouns or nouns-minus-verbs comparisons. \n\nResults continue to be somewhat inconsistent if one considers the locations of verb- and noun-specific areas in those studies where grammatical class effects were actually found. For example, Shapiro et al. ( ) used a word\/pseudo-word inflection task and found that verbs provoked greater activation than nouns in the anterior portion of the left superior frontal gyrus, in the LIFG including Broca's area, and in the right cerebellum, while nouns elicited stronger activation than verbs in the middle part of the superior temporal gyrus, the middle portions of the left fusiform gyrus, and in the right insula and cerebellum. These results are in line with the fronto-temporal dichotomy originally described by Damasio and Tranel ( ), and were further confirmed in other neuroimaging studies (Chao and Martin,  ; Tranel et al.,  ). However, no verb-specific frontal activation was found in other experiments. Damasio et al. ( ) for example, observed verb-specific activation in the middle left temporal gyrus in an experiment where picture naming was compared to a non-linguistic baseline (i.e., orientation judgment on unfamiliar faces). Berlingeri et al. ( ) conducted a factorial study with two experimental tasks (picture naming of nouns and verbs, and a verb-from-noun and noun-from-verb derivation task), and found reliable across-task verb-specific activation bilaterally in the precentral and postcentral gyri, in the right SMA, and again bilaterally in the paracentral lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior parietal lobule, and the precuneus: none of the left dorsolateral prefrontal areas was activated to a greater extent by verbs than by nouns. Similar considerations can be made when we turn our attention to the brain areas that were shown to be associated to noun processing. Bedny and Thompson-Schill ( ) for example, found that the LIFG and the left inferior temporal gyrus were more strongly activated by nouns than by verbs in a semantic matching task. However, in a word inflection experiment Shapiro et al. ( ) found that the only area emerging from a direct nouns-minus-verbs comparison was the left fusiform gyrus. \n\nThese apparently inconsistent data are quite relevant for the hotly debated topic of sensorimotor contribution to abstract concept representation (e.g., Gallese and Lakoff,  ) and, more in general, for that of embodied theories of cognition (e.g., Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia,  ). In fact verbs typically denote actions, and frequently refer to human movements that clearly have motoric counterparts in the cognitive system (e.g., to walk, to pick, to throw, to talk); if indeed abstract concepts were truly based on sensorimotor knowledge, verb lexical-semantic representation would substantially call upon proprioceptive, tactile, and motoric information (e.g., Shebani and Pulverm\u00fcller,  ). Several theories have been proposed based on this core idea. They range from a \u201csoft\u201d position whereby verb meaning relies on abstract representations that interact dynamically with our sensory and motor systems (Bedny and Caramazza,  ), to a stronger position whereby the verb meaning itself is the sensory-motor experience that occurs every time a specific action is either made or observed (e.g., Pulverm\u00fcller,  ; Gallese and Lakoff,  ). Theories at the softer end of this continuum suggest that action verb processing relies on a wide network of amodal brain regions including left frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices; on the other hand, strong embodied views of cognition suggest that action verb processing is primarily based on the activity of the primary motor cortex (Hauk et al.,  ). Other scholars, working along similar lines, have reported data suggesting that verb processing relies on a network of action-related brain areas outside the motor strip (right SMA, right and left paracentral lobules, right and left superior and inferior parietal lobules, and right and left precuneus; Berlingeri et al.,  ), thus proposing that verb lexical processing activates action-oriented, visuo-spatial, rather than low-level motoric information. It is interesting to note that a clear divide between action verbs and non-action verbs does not emerge from these data (Aggujaro et al.,  ; Berlingeri et al.,  ) which would seem to imply that the parietal regions, which are the primary basis for the planning of object-related actions (Grefkes and Fink,  ), are also involved in the lexical processing of non-action verbs. \n\nSeveral other theories have been proposed to account for neurofunctional data on verb and noun processing. Originally, mostly on the basis of the influential paper by Damasio and Tranel ( ), verbs and nouns were held to have distinct and anatomically separate neural underpinnings, with verbs being mainly processed in the left frontal regions and nouns in the left temporal lobe. This position continued to be held for quite some time (Cappa et al.,  ; Cappa and Perani,  ; Shapiro et al.,  ), but seems to be hardly tenable: as noted in a recent review by Crepaldi et al. ( ), of 15 neuroimaging studies that reported verb-noun direct contrasts, only five showed verb-specific activation in left frontal areas, and only two showed noun-specific activation in a left temporal region. Of course, caution should be taken when interpreting these figures, as the use of different technical and experimental details could determine changes in the results of fMRI studies (e.g., block vs. event-related design, statistical thresholds, sample size); but there still seems to be little justification for suggesting a specific role in verb processing for frontal areas. This consideration also casts doubts on a more recent proposal which suggests that verb-specific processing does not rely exclusively on frontal areas, but on a more complex circuit that includes the left middle frontal gyrus (Willms et al.,  ), or the temporo-parietal junction (Aggujaro et al.,  ; Tranel et al.,  ). Basically, any theory that attributes a substantial role to frontal areas in verb processing seems to be unsupported overall by fMRI\/PET evidence (unless they can explain why these cerebral regions do not emerge as verb-specific in such a large proportion of the neuroimaging studies focusing on this issue). \n\nAnother popular position is that grammatical class   per se   is not an organizing principle in the neural organization of the language areas; rather, the main divide would be semantic, and would follow the object vs. action dichotomy (Bird et al.,  ,  ; Vigliocco et al.,  ). From a behavioral point of view, children would start by learning lexical labels for prototypical objects and prototypical actions, and subsequently would discover that their distribution in sentences varies and that they sub-serve different communicational roles (object words denote, action words predicate). The grammatical classes of nouns and verbs would then be built on the basis of these cues, but the distinction between the two would remain strongly linked to their origins. This is why noun-verb neural effects emerge clearly only when prototypical nouns (i.e., object nouns) and prototypical verbs (i.e., action verbs) are investigated (Vigliocco et al.,  ). From an anatomic point of view, this theory is very similar to that outlined in the previous paragraph: action (verb) processing would rely more on a fronto-parietal network, whereas object (noun) processing would depend on inferotemporal structures. Although functionally speaking the theory is plausible and might be separated from its anatomical counterpart, much of the neuroimaging evidence provided so far does not support either a specific role for frontal areas in action word\/verb processing or for temporal regions in object word\/noun processing (Tyler et al.,  ; Tranel et al.,  ; Liljestr\u00f6m et al.,  ; Crepaldi et al.,  ). \n\nIt should be apparent that the wealth of alternative accounts is at least partly motivated by the diversity of the experimental results reported so far. It is thus essential to try to distinguish unreliable observations from those with a solid experimental base, also taking into account the number of factors that may underlie inconsistent results across neuroimaging studies on nouns and verbs. These factors include, for example, the high heterogeneity of the experimental and baseline tasks used in the various studies. In fact, different tasks involve different cognitive processes, with two important consequences: first, as it is plausible that different cognitive processes are carried out in different parts of the cortex, it is unlikely that, for example, the semantic processing of verbs will recruit the same areas as the phonological processing of verbs. Moreover, nouns and verbs might be anatomically segregated at some cognitive stage (e.g., morphological analysis), but not at others (e.g., phonological encoding); since different tasks tap into different cognitive stages, it is not surprising that anatomical separation might emerge in, e.g., picture naming, but not in, e.g., lexical decision. Even when only focusing on neuroimaging experiments, evidence has emerged from tasks such as picture naming and syntactic judgment, lexical decision and generation of derived forms (e.g., \u201cdealer\u201d from \u201cdeal\u201d), forced-choice semantic association and verbal fluency. Orthographic processing, lexical identification, semantic processing, syntactic planning and analysis, lexical selection, and phonological encoding are all processing stages that have been addressed very differently in different studies, through the use of different experimental tasks. Task diversity is thus clearly a factor that has contributed variability to this literature (e.g., Berlingeri et al.,  ). \n\nAnother important factor is cognitive processing load: some recent studies have reported convincing evidence that brain activations change substantially according to whether a specific combination of task and stimulus imposes a high cognitive demand, or is instead very easy and fast to process (Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Snyder et al.,  ; Berlingeri et al.,  ). Scholars have recently started to take these factors into account while evaluating whether the data currently available can be explained satisfactorily within a theoretical account. However, they have come to somewhat different conclusions. Vigliocco et al. ( ) suggest that, once cognitive demand is taken into consideration, neuroimaging data on nouns and verbs can indeed be interpreted in a theoretical framework that sits noun processing within the inferior temporal cortex and verb processing within a network involving frontal and parietal areas. On the contrary, Crepaldi et al. ( ) deny the possibility that neuroimaging data on nouns and verbs can be accounted for satisfactorily within any theoretical framework that assumes spatially segregated neural substrates for the two grammatical classes. They also suggest that this holds even after task-specific and cognitive demand effects were taken into account. The authors propose that nouns and verbs are processed in neural circuits that do not overlap completely (or otherwise neuropsychological dissociations would never be possible), but are   not   clearly spatially segregated, at least at the spatial resolution normally considered in neuroimaging studies. Noun and verb circuits would be strictly interleaved with each other and dispersed in a complex network spanning virtually all over the brain. Thus, the emergence of grammatical class specific regions in fMRI studies would be highly variable and very much dependent on fine details concerning the task used, the specific stimuli selected, the methods of analysis, etc. [for converging evidence in this direction, see Liljestr\u00f6m et al. ( ) and Sahin et al. ( )]. \n\nTo sum up, data on the neural basis of noun and verb processing seem to be highly inconsistent, to the point that no general theory proposed so far appears to be able to explain an acceptable proportion of them. Descriptive reviews of this literature have driven different authors to different conclusions (Crepaldi et al.,  ; Vigliocco et al.,  ), thus calling for a more formal assessment of this issue. In the present study fMRI data on nouns and verbs were thus submitted to a quantitative and theory-blind meta-analysis with the aim of addressing the following questions: (i) are the neural circuits responsible for noun and verb processing spatially segregated in the brain? (ii) If there are specific cerebral areas for nouns and verbs, where are they located? (iii) Which theory of the neural processing of nouns and verbs is best supported by this picture? As clearly highlighted above, while addressing these questions it is necessary to take into account which cognitive task generated brain activations. We thus adopted a methodological approach that allows not only to assess to what extent any brain region is committed to either nouns or verbs, but also whether grammatical-class specificity depends on the experimental task, or rather holds independently of this factor . \n\nThere are several methods available for formal meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, among which the most popular is probably Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The logic behind this approach is simple, and yet very powerful. A spatial probability distribution is modeled for each activation peak included in the dataset of interest. The voxel-by-voxel union of these distributions is used as an activation likelihood map, which is then tested for statistical significance against randomly generated sets of foci. ALE was proven to be a reliable way of blending evidence from multiple studies (e.g., Turkeltaub et al.,  ) and was applied successfully to fields as diverse as motor learning (Bernard and Seidler,  ), autism (Dickstein et al.,  ), and numbers and mental calculation (Arsalidou and Taylor,  ). However, it was not suited for our purposes. In particular, ALE is not able to deal with design with multiple independent variables, and here we want to consider the role of   both   grammatical class (X1)   and   task (X2). ALE strategy in these cases would be to consider separate sets of foci for each combination of grammatical class and task (nouns in picture naming, verbs in picture naming, nouns in lexical decision, and so on), and run one meta-analysis for each of these sets. This strategy would be problematic for two reasons. First, it would face a serious power issue: the overall dataset would be divided into several subsets, which would imply running meta-analyses on a low number of peaks. Second (and most important), such an analysis would tell us whether any given area is specific for any X1\u2013X2 combination, but it would not show   in a statistically supported manner   whether any area is specific for, e.g., nouns in picture naming and verbs in lexical decision, or nouns in semantic tasks and verbs in syntactic tasks. In formal terms, it would not be possible to assess the interaction between grammatical class and task. Because there is solid evidence that this type of interactions do arise when assessing grammatical class specificity in different tasks (e.g., Palti et al.,  ; Berlingeri et al.,  ), this would have been a serious limitation of the ALE procedure. \n\nWe thus resorted to hierarchical clustering to carry out the meta-analysis (Jobard et al.,  ), using in particular the algorithm designed by Cattinelli et al. ( ) and previously adopted by Cattinelli et al. ( ). This algorithm permits the identification of clusters from a data set of noun-related or verb-related activation peaks on the basis of a pre-defined spatial resolution criterion. At this stage, the algorithm was completely blind as to which grammatical class or experimental task was associated with each single peak: it simply grouped peaks that were spatially close. After the clusters were identified, the distribution of noun- and verb-specific peaks in each cluster was statistically assessed in order to understand whether it was significantly different from chance. A similar analysis was carried out to capture grammatical-class specificities that were task-dependent (e.g., peaks that were associated with nouns in a given task, but with verbs in another task). The important point to make here is that the procedure was completely data-driven, and the spatial contiguity of the activation peaks was evaluated without any theoretical bias, a condition which is virtually impossible to reach in descriptive meta-analyses (e.g., Crepaldi et al.,  ; Vigliocco et al.,  )\u2014where some degree of subjective evaluation of data coherence is inevitable\u2014or in original experimental studies where the experimental paradigm is generally constructed to assess some specific theoretical tenet. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data collection and preparation \n  \nThe present meta-analysis is based on 36 neuroimaging studies investigating the neural basis of noun and verb processing using either PET or fMRI on adult subjects, published on peer-reviewed journals from 1996 to March 2011. The studies were selected according to the following procedure. We first ran two queries through the PubMed database using the following search keys: \u201cnouns AND verbs AND fMRI\u201d and \u201cnoun AND verbs AND PET.\u201d The search keys were sought in all entry fields. These queries generated 64 and 15 entries, respectively. Because we were also interested in papers that only included either nouns or verbs, we ran other four queries through the same database searching for \u201cnoun AND fMRI,\u201d \u201cnouns AND PET,\u201d \u201cverbs AND fMRI,\u201d and \u201cverbs AND PET.\u201d After removing duplicates, we were left with 164 records, which were then screened to exclude those studies that clearly did not satisfy the inclusion criteria as revealed by the title, keywords, or abstract. For example, several studies did include nouns and\/or verbs as stimuli, but focused on cognitive issues outside the interest of this meta-analysis (e.g., mental images, syntax); other studies presented nouns and verbs in a connected text, thus triggering semantic and syntactic processing that clearly hinders any lexical interpretation of the results; other studies did not make use of functional imaging techniques (i.e., were purely behavioral or neuropsychological studies), or investigated special populations, such as deaf people, children, elderly people, or patients with brain injuries or some form of degenerative disease. Fifty-six studies survived the screening and were thus assessed more thoroughly. Among these 56, 20 were excluded because they did not report any of the following: (i) a simple effect analysis of nouns vs. a non\u2013noun baseline; (ii) a simple effect analysis of verbs vs. a non-verb baseline; (iii) a direct comparison analysis of verbs vs. nouns; (iv) a direct comparison analysis of nouns vs. verbs. Region-of-interest analyses were not considered. \n\nThe main characteristics of the 36 experiments included in this meta-analysis are reported in Table  . \n  \n List of the papers included in the present metanalysis  . \n  \nFWE, Family Wise Error correction for multiple comparisons; FDR, False Discovery Rate correction for multiple comparisons. \n  \nWe considered peaks emerging from simple effects of nouns vs. baseline and verbs vs. baseline, and peaks corresponding to direct comparisons of verbs-minus-nouns and nouns-minus-verbs; activation coordinates that emerged in conjunction analyses or main effects (e.g., the main effect of task irrespective to grammatical class) and those reflecting more selective processes (e.g., pure morphological processes, i.e., inflection of regular verbs vs. inflection of irregular verbs) were excluded. \n\nAfter applying the above criteria the final working dataset was composed of 946 stereotaxic activation loci, 454 associated with nouns and 492 associated with verbs. Activation peaks were also classified according to the experimental task in which they were generated. We considered as separate categories in this variable: (i) lexical decision; (ii) semantic tasks (including semantic categorization tasks, forced-choice semantic association tasks, pleasantness judgment tasks, and synonym monitoring tasks); (iii) picture naming; (iv) generation tasks (including classical fluency tasks and cued single-item generation); (v) derivational tasks; (vi) inflectional tasks, including morphological judgment and phrase completion, when this required the subjects to generate the correctly inflected form; and (vii) syntactic judgment tasks. We did not separate tasks on the basis of whether they required covert vs. overt responses; however, in the majority of the experiments considered in this work participants were required to produce their responses covertly, so as to avoid movement-related artifacts in the imaging data. \n\nThe stereotaxic coordinates of earlier studies\u2014in which activation peaks were reported in terms of the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,  )\u2014were transformed into the more recent MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) stereotaxic space (Mazziotta et al.,  ); the transformation was done using a MATLAB script described at  . \n\n\n### Clustering procedure \n  \nFunctions available with MATLAB 7 (MathWorks corporation,  ) were used to execute hierarchical clustering of activation peaks. The code is available from the third author on request. \n\nFirst, the algorithm computed squared Euclidean distances between each pair of input data, and then merged, at each processing step, the two existing clusters with minimum dissimilarity. Dissimilarity was measured adopting Ward's ( ) criterion, which at each processing step selects the two clusters which, when merged, produce the minimum increase in the total intra-cluster variance. This procedure resulted in a tree (see Figure  ), whose leaves represent singletons (i.e., clusters formed of a single activation peak), and whose root represents one large cluster including all the 946 activation peaks input to the algorithm. Each level of the tree reports the clusters created by the algorithm at a specific processing step, as it progresses from individual activation peaks at the lowest level to the all-inclusive final cluster at the top of the tree. To determine the final set of clusters for further analyses (i.e., the level at which we \u201ccut\u201d the cluster tree), we averaged standard deviations in the   x, y  , and   z   directions over all clusters for each processing step. Starting from the leaves, we moved up the tree until the average standard deviation in each direction remained below 5 mm: this was done in order to obtain clusters whose dispersion around the center is compatible with a standard neuroimaging spatial resolution of approximately 10 mm. \n  \n Example of dendrogram (tree) resulting from the hierarchical clustering procedure  . The leaves at the bottom represent each individual activation coordinate. At each subsequent step, two clusters from the level immediately below are merged to form a new cluster. The number of clusters is thus decreased by one at each level, going from a total of   N   clusters at step 1 (where   N   is the number of input activation peaks) to one all-inclusive cluster at the last step. \n  \nHierarchical clustering is sensitive to the order in which the individual peaks are processed, thus generating alternative clustering trees (Morgan and Ray,  ). In order to tackle this problem and preserve the uniqueness of the clustering solution, a variant of the original algorithm was used which considers all different clustering solutions (given a specific spatial resolution) and attempts to identify the best one on the basis of their between-cluster error sum of squares (  B  -  EES  ), defined as:\n \nwhere   C   is the number of clusters in the considered solution,   n   is the number of elements in the cluster   k  , \u03bc  is the mean of the cluster   k  , and \u03bc  is the mean of the entire dataset. Basically,   B \u2013 EES   quantifies the spatial separation between the clusters, and the best clustering solution is considered to be the one with maximal separation, i.e., maximal   B   \u2013   EES  . \n\nThe mean coordinates of each cluster included in the final set were then passed as an input to a MATLAB script that was developed for the automatic anatomical labeling of the activation coordinates. This script queries the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template available in the MRIcro visualization software (Rorden and Brett,  ) to identify each individual cluster on the basis of its mean coordinates. \n\nHierarchical clustering identifies clusters of stereotaxic coordinates on the grounds that the resulting solution (the set of resulting clusters and the sets of coordinates that compose each cluster) has a minimized within-cluster and between-cluster variance. This procedure, as discussed in the Introduction, has the advantage of permitting a   post-hoc   assessment of the functional meaning of a given cluster on the basis of its data content. However, it does not quantify the significance of each individual cluster with reference to the probability of a spatially distributed statistical process. This aspect was investigated further by checking that our significant clusters would have also emerged with a different meta-analytical method, i.e., the Activation Likelihood Estimate as implemented in the GingerAle software  (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nIn order to guarantee sufficient statistical power to the analyses and to exclude clusters that were not clear sign of converging evidence, only those clusters that contained 10 or more activation peaks, coming from at least five different studies were considered further. Because it was impossible to determine   a priori   the exact cluster size that granted the statistical analysis the desired reliability, the 10-peaks and 5-studies thresholds were set   a posteriori   on the basis of the actual distribution of the relevant variables in the final cluster set (see Figure  ). \n  \n Cluster distribution for the number of peaks included in each cluster (  X  -axis) and the number of studies contributing peaks to each cluster (  Y  -axis)  . The bimodal distribution of these variables is illustrated in the main panel, where each point represents a cluster (note that several points\/clusters may overlap because of a same number of studies and peaks included). Unimodal distributions are represented through the histograms in the side panels. Dotted lines represent cut-off values. \n  \nThe clusters that survived this selection were analysed in order to assess whether they were associated with (i) either grammatical class, or (ii) a specific task, or (iii) showed a more complex pattern reflecting a task-by-grammatical-class interaction. For each cluster, we created a contingency table reporting the number of activation peaks for each combination of grammatical class (verbs vs. nouns) and experimental task (lexical decision tasks vs. semantic tasks vs. picture naming vs. fluency tasks vs. inflectional tasks vs. derivational tasks vs. syntactic tasks). To assess specificity for grammatical class, we tested whether the distribution of noun- and verb-related peaks within each cluster was significantly different from the overall proportion of noun- and verb-related peaks included in the whole sample of coordinates (492\/946 = 0.52 for verbs and 454\/946 = 0.48 for nouns). To this end, we used the binomial distribution and computed the probability of observing a specific number of peaks associated with a given grammatical class as the number of successes in a series of independent randomly-distributed trials: when this probability was below 0.05, the cluster was considered to be associated with either noun or verb processing. The same logic was applied to investigate task specificity; an exact multinomial test was used to compare the peak distribution by task within each cluster with the overall distribution of the entire set of peaks included in this meta-analysis. Task-by-grammatical class interaction was tested with Fisher's exact test (Fisher,  ); this estimates whether the distribution of one categorical variable (grammatical class, in our case) varies according to the levels of a second categorical variable (experimental task), thus revealing clusters that were associated with either grammatical class in one task (e.g., nouns in morphological tasks), but with the opposite grammatical class in another task (e.g., verbs in picture naming). All post-clustering statistical analyses were performed using the free statistical software R (version 2.10.1; R Development Core Team,  ); the code is available from the first author on request. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe algorithm identified a total of 120 clusters scattered all over the brain, with 1 to 20 individual peaks each, from 1 to 11 different studies (see Figure  ), and had mean standard deviations along the three axes of 4.41 mm (  x  -axis), 4.76 mm (  y  -axis) and 4.89 mm (  z  -axis). Thirty-two of these clusters included 10 or more peaks from at least 5 different studies and were thus analysed for grammatical class and task specificity, and for task-by-grammatical class interaction. A complete list of these clusters is provided in Table  . \n  \n List of the clusters that include at least 10 activation peaks from at least five different studies obtained through the application of the algorithm  . \n  \nFrom left to right: cluster ID; mean X, Y, and Z coordinates of the peaks included in each cluster, and their standard deviation along the three axes; number of peaks included in each cluster; number of studies from which these peaks come; and brain area in which the central coordinates of each cluster are included. \n  \nThree clusters were associated with nouns (clusters 33, 86, and 118; see Table  ), while only one was associated with verbs (cluster 82; Table  ). The clusters associated with nouns were located in the left inferior parietal gyrus, the left angular gyrus, and the right inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis (see Figure  ). The cluster associated with verbs was located in the posterior part of the right middle occipital gyrus (Figure  ). \n  \n Noun- and verb-specific clusters as revealed by the meta-analytic procedure  . \n  \nFrom left to right: cluster ID; brain area in which the center of the cluster falls; noun- and verb-related peak distribution; probability associated with this distribution, calculated separately for noun and verb on the basis of a binomial distribution. \n    \nPanel   (A)   illustrates the clusters that are associated either with noun (green) or verb (purple) processing. Panel   (B)   reports the clusters that are associated with task-by-grammatical class interaction (the brighter the color, the higher the number of activation peaks included in the cluster). \n  \nThree clusters (42, 45, and 101) showed task-by-grammatical class interaction as revealed by Fisher's exact test; these clusters were located in the right insula, in the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis, and in the left insula\/left temporal pole (Figure  ). The task-by-grammatical class distribution of the activation peaks included in each cluster is provided in Table  . \n  \n Task-by-grammatical class distribution of the activation peaks included in each of the five clusters showing interaction between these two factors  . \n  \nLexDec, lexical decision; SemJdg, semantic judgment; PicNam, picture naming; Flu, fluency tasks; Der, derivational tasks; Infl, inflectional tasks; SyntJdg, syntactic judgment. \n  \nBecause task specificity was not the focus of this study and was only investigated as a co-varying variable for grammatical class (i.e., we were interested in the interaction between task and grammatical class, not in task effects   per se  ), we do not report extensively on these results here, nor we will comment on them in the Discussion. However, we do note that the data on cluster task-specificity confirmed the reliability of our methodology, as they highlighted all the benchmark associations between tasks and brain areas, including fluency and the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally (clusters 44 and 45); morphology and the left inferior frontal gyrus (clusters 100 and 111); word production in general (fluency + picture naming + derivational task) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (cluster 46); and picture naming and the middle occipital gyrus (cluster 2; see Table  ). \n  \n Task-specific clusters  . \n  \nFrom left to right: cluster ID; brain area in which the center of the cluster falls; cluster distribution for task, in number of peaks and percentages; probability associated with this distribution, calculated on the basis of an exact multinomial test. Italic figures indicate the task where the majority of the peaks lie. \n  \nAs a final assessment of our data, we evaluated its spatial significance with GingerAle, which showed that all seven clusters identified by hierarchical clustering and associated with either noun processing, verb processing or task-by-grammatical class interaction were also significant with this analysis (  p   < 0.05; Laird et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAt a first glance, the results reported in the previous studies on the cerebral localization of noun and verb processing appear to be largely inconsistent (Perani et al.,  ; Tyler et al.,  ; Cappa et al.,  ; Saccuman et al.,  ; Siri et al.,  ; Crepaldi et al.,  ), which puts into question the generality of any theory proposed so far on the issue (Hauk et al.,  ; Berlingeri et al.,  ; Bedny and Caramazza,  ). The present study aimed at providing a formal assessment of these apparently inconsistent data, so as to understand whether noun and verb processing recruits separate brain circuits, and, if so, where noun- and verb-specific areas are located in the human brain. We addressed these issues by feeding a clustering algorithm with all the activation peaks reported as grammatical-class specific in PET and fMRI studies on nouns and verbs; the clusters singled out by this process were then analysed to find out (i) whether they contained more noun- or verb-related peaks than might be expected on the basis of chance and (ii) whether the noun-verb distribution of the activation peaks varied across different experimental tasks. Three of the 32 reliable clusters generated by the algorithm were found to be associated with nouns; these clusters are located in the left inferior parietal gyrus, the left angular gyrus, and the right inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis. One cluster, located in the right middle occipital gyrus, included a higher-than-chance proportion of verb-related peaks. Finally, three clusters showed a task-by-grammatical class interaction; these were located in the right insula, in the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis, and in the left insula\/left temporal pole. \n\nA first, self-evident, observation is that the vast majority of the clusters identified by the algorithm (27 out of 32) is   not   specific for grammatical class. It is important to note that the peaks in these clusters have been included in this meta-analysis only because they were reported as either noun or verb specific   in the original studies  . In this perspective, the results suggest that brain areas may be specific for grammatical class in one particular study, but turn out to be not specific for grammatical class if all the data available is considered. The evidence just does not add up, confirming the results that emerged from a qualitative review (Crepaldi et al.,  ). Importantly, some of these clusters are located in areas that have been the focus of discussion in previous neuroimaging studies (e.g., the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left insula, the middle temporal gyrus) and that most scholars in the field consider as associated with either noun or verb processing as a matter of fact: this data utterly show that this is far from being clear. \n\nThis has important consequences for most of the theories on the neural underpinnings of noun and verb processing. Clearly, a position whereby frontal areas are predominantly involved in verb processing, whereas temporal regions are more active for noun processing (Damasio and Tranel,  ; Cappa and Perani,  ) is not tenable. No single verb-related cluster emerged in the frontal lobe, in spite of the fact that 17 clusters were identified in that brain region. Similarly, among the six clusters singled out by the algorithm in the left and right temporal lobes, none included significantly more noun peaks than verb peaks. Although radically different from the functional point of view, also the semantic theory of noun and verb representation put forward by Vigliocco et al. ( ) suggests that verb\/action word processing should rely predominantly on frontal areas and noun\/object word processing relies predominantly on temporal regions. This hypothesis is therefore not supported by the results of the present study. \n\nSimilar considerations can be made with respect to strong embodied views according to which lexical processing of movement verbs should elicit activation in the portion of the motor strip that represents the body part involved in the actual movement (e.g., the hand for \u201cpick,\u201d the tongue for \u201click\u201d; Hauk et al.,  ). As all types of verbs were considered in our meta-analysis, it was clearly unrealistic to expect that most verb clusters would be located in the primary motor area. However, six studies in our database employed motor verbs (Damasio et al.,  ; Grossman et al.,  ; Tyler et al.,  ; Saccuman et al.,  ; van Dam et al.,  ; Rodr\u00edguez-Ferreiro et al.,  ), which contributed 59 peaks to our set. Even considering that the motor verbs used in these studies involved different body parts (and would thus be expected to drive activation in different parts of the motor strip according to Hauk et al.,  ), it is surprising that none of these 59 peaks clustered into the primary motor area. \n\nBedny and Caramazza ( ) and Berlingeri et al. ( ) interpreted their results as indicating that verb processing is based on a fairly wide neural network, rather than on individual brain areas: the former authors suggested that this network is left lateralized and includes frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, whereas the latter authors described data pointing to a more bilateral circuit, based particularly on posterior parietal areas. These reports do not seem to fit the data which emerged from this meta-analysis. None of the five parietal clusters identified by the algorithm were significantly associated with verbs (against Berlingeri et al.,  ). With regard to Bedny and Caramazza, ( ) proposal [but see also Hagoort ( ) and Mahon and Caramazza ( )], the high rate of non-specific clusters is not compatible with a wide, verb-specific circuit that involves left frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Moreover, the location of those clusters that did show specificity for either grammatical class is also inconsistent with this view. It is possible, of course that a fronto-temporo-parietal network is indeed operating when decoding verbs (particularly action verbs), as suggested by Bedny and Caramazza ( ). However, this network is clearly also called upon by noun processing. \n\nAltogether, the rigorous, theory-blind meta-analytic procedure used in this study confirms that the theories proposed so far are able to account for a limited portion of the available results. Moreover, they indicate that this does not depend on confounding variables. For example, several scholars have noted that the type of experimental task may affect which brain areas emerge as related to noun or verb processing (Palti et al.,  ); so, using different tasks in different studies may have hindered factual regularities in anatomo-functional correlations. However, we did take task into account in this study, and still the evidence remains weak for consistent associations between brain areas and grammatical classes (see also Crepaldi et al.,  ). \n\nThe vast predominance of unspecific clusters is more compatible with a framework in which a set of brain areas (including, but not limited to, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left insula, and the middle temporal gyrus) is responsible for   both   noun   and   verb processing. The neural circuits related to these grammatical classes would be spatially segregated (otherwise neuropsychological dissociations and the grammatical-class specificity that emerged in certain imaging studies would never have been possible), but would also be located within the same brain areas, so as to become consistently separable only at a spatial resolution below those of fMRI and PET (Crepaldi et al.,  ). \n\nNot only does this theoretical position reconcile the scattered neuroimaging evidence on noun and verb processing, but it is also strongly supported by three elements. The first emerged from our interaction analyses, which revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left insula, often assumed to be verb areas, are in fact associated with either noun or verb processing according to the specific task under investigation (see also Thompson-Schill et al.,  ; Berlingeri et al.,  ). Although this evidence should be treated with caution, given that some tasks were clearly under-represented in our set, it is in line with the hypothesis that these brain areas host both noun and verb related circuits, which are used in different ways by different test settings. The second and third elements in support of this \u201cspatial-contiguity\u201d hypothesis come from recent studies using imaging methods other than PET and fMRI: these studies demonstrated how noun- and verb-related cerebral activity are closely linked, both spatially and temporally. In an experiment comparing fMRI and MEG, Liljestr\u00f6m et al. ( ) failed to find any specific noun- or verb-related activation, with the only exception of a quasi-significant difference in the frontal region between 320 and 800 ms after stimulus presentation, i.e., well-below the temporal resolution allowed by fMRI. On the other hand, Sahin et al. ( ), using a methodology that combines a millisecond temporal resolution and a millimeter spatial resolution (Intra-Cranial Electrophysiology), showed that cortical signatures of lexical, syntactic and phonological processing for nouns and verbs are virtually identical, even in time windows that are well-below fMRI temporal precision (between 200 and 450 ms from stimulus presentation). \n\nThis general view of the neural underpinnings of noun and verb processing would also account for anatomo-correlative data. The neurophysiology of brain lesions clearly does not permit anatomo-clinical associations at a fine-grained spatial resolution: only sizeable lesions yield neuropsychologically relevant symptoms, so it is not possible to associate specific cognitive operations to particularly small brain regions. It follows that if noun and verb circuits are located close to each other in a specific brain area and can only be distinguished well below the spatial resolution allowed by anatomo-clinical correlation studies, it is not surprising that even similar brain lesions give rise to different behavioral patterns (e.g., a severe verb-specific impairment in one case\u2014Damasio and Tranel,  ; Tranel et al.,  \u2014as opposed to moderate, grammatical-class unspecific impairment in another\u2014De Renzi and Di Pellegrino,  ). \n\nWithin this general framework, our meta-analysis does find some clusters that are specific for grammatical class consistently across studies. Particularly in consideration of the fact that some of these clusters sit in areas that have gone unnoticed in previous research, it is worth taking a close look. \n\nBy means of the clustering procedure, noun-specific clusters were identified in the left angular gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis. Given that the vast majority of the peaks in these clusters come from lexical decision, picture naming, and semantic judgment tasks, it is likely that these areas underlie lexical-semantic processing, possibly word identification and retrieval. These data further confirm the implications in the previous paragraphs, i.e., that strong embodied theories of concept representation are not supported by neurolinguistic evidence on noun and verb processing. These theories would lead one to expect visuo-motor cortices to underlie lexical and semantic processing of nouns, whereas the noun-specific clusters identified in this study are located outside those areas. Tool nouns (e.g., screwdriver, whistle) would have been a perfect test case as they are clearly related to specific motor patterns; however, activation peaks for these nouns were so rare in our data set (only 30 out of a total of 454 noun peaks) that it was not possible to apply the clustering algorithm to them alone. Nevertheless, they could well have clustered in, say, the primary motor area or posterior parietal areas had they been   consistently   located there; but in fact they did not cluster at all\u2014only 1 of those 30 peaks is included in a noun cluster\u2014, which indicates that they were scattered over different brain regions. \n\nOne cluster, located in the posterior part of the right middle temporal gyrus, turned out to be predominantly associated with verb processing; action-related activation in this brain region is frequently reported in the literature though its contribution is for some reason neglected. It is only in recent years that attention has been focused on the right posterior middle temporal gyrus during action processing (Kable et al.,  ; Tettamanti et al.,  ; Assmus et al.,  ; Deen and McCarthy,  ). Assmus et al. ( ), for example, explored the neural activations associated with a familiarity judgment on pictures representing whole-body actions (e.g., dancing) vs. manipulable objects (e.g., telephone) and non-manipulable objects (e.g., motorway), observing increased bilateral activation in the middle temporal gyrus, the inferior and superior parietal cortex, and the premotor cortex. However, their study did not involve explicit linguistic processing, and so these areas might simply reflect the activation of action-related, human body representation. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus is often associated with sensory-motor integration (e.g., Bangert et al.,  ) and is anatomically contiguous to the visual area MT [  x   = 45.5 (8.1);   y   = \u221265.9 (7.9);   z   = \u22120.9 (6.5); Mendola et al.,  ]. It could thus be speculated that visuo-motor processing and the sensorimotor attributes of actions may have represented the phylogenetic and ontogenetic \u201cpoint of entry\u201d for the development of a more complete action knowledge, which might have evolved gradually into a more general verb knowledge [for a similar argument on different brain areas, see Aggujaro et al. ( ) and Berlingeri et al. ( ); see also Watson and Chatterjee ( ), for a general formulation of the \u201cpoint of entry\u201d theory]. In light of this hypothesis it is intriguing that a right, and not left, hemisphere cluster in this area turned out to be associated with verbs: the two posterior middle temporal clusters identified by the algorithm in the left hemisphere contained the same quantity of noun and verb peaks. This could be explained by the fact that most studies investigated tool nouns, thus inducing activation to the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions, typically associated with tool use. \n\nThis hypothesis provides a certain degree of support to weak embodied theories, which simply see abstract representations as related to their visuo-motor counterpart. Verb representations would be linked to action-related, human body information, which, however, would by no means constitute the core of verb representations; these latter have their own stance   independently   of motoric information, and relate to it through the mediation of higher-level, modality independent neural systems (e.g., Hagoort,  ; Bedny and Caramazza,  ; van Ackeren et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe meta-analysis described in this paper has confirmed that the neuroimaging evidence obtained so far on noun and verb processing does not indicate a great deal of grammatical class specificity in the brain, at least at the spatial resolution normally allowed by imaging experiments: most of the brain areas that have been considered as associated with noun- and verb-processing are shown to include a statistically indistinguishable quantity of noun and verb peaks,   if all the imaging studies on this issue are considered together  . These data are at odds with embodied theories of verb representation, in both the weak and strong variants, and also with the widely held account that verb processing relies on frontal areas and noun processing is based on temporal regions. Instead, these results are coherent with the idea that the neural circuits responsible for verb and noun processing are not spatially segregated in different brain areas, but are strictly interleaved with each other in a mainly left-lateralized fronto-temporo-parietal network (26 of the 32 clusters identified by the algorithm lie in that hemisphere), which, however, also includes right-hemisphere structures (Liljestr\u00f6m et al.,  ; Sahin et al.,  ; Crepaldi et al.,  ). In this general picture, there are indeed brain regions where noun and verb circuits cluster together so as to become spatially visible to fMRI and PET in a replicable manner, but they are limited in number and are probably located in the periphery of the functional architecture of the neural structures responsible for noun and verb processing. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3695563,"text_md5":"4d0ec10bba5a9e72c5aa01463a09e03d","field_positions":{"authors":[0,131],"journal":[132,150],"publication_year":[152,156],"title":[167,279],"keywords":[293,404],"abstract":[417,2303],"body":[2312,55906]},"batch":1,"pmid":23825451,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2013.00303","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3695563","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3695563"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3695563\">3695563<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3695563  Clustering the lexicon in the brain: a meta-analysis of the neurofunctional evidence on noun and verb processing"}

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique that might potentially fill in this gap. Nevertheless, studies using this approach feature great methodological heterogeneity, such as varying voxel of choice, differences on emphasized metabolites, and absence of a standardized unit. In this study, we present a methodology for creating a systematic review and meta-analysis for this kind of scientific evidence using the prototypical case of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.\n  Systematic review registration:  \nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), CRD42018112418. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.   It is a prevalent disorder among children and adolescents that often persists into adulthood.   ADHD is also highly associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders   and negative outcomes, such as poor quality of life,   unemployment,   and increased mortality.   The economic burden associated with ADHD in the U.S. alone is estimated to be US$67-116B yearly due to lack of productivity.   Even so, key aspects of the neural basis of the disorder remain to be unmasked.  \n\nSince the 1990s, major advances in technology have made it possible to better understand brain diseases through the study of the brain\n  in vivo  \n.   Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, for instance, have shown the role of frontoparietal and default mode network systems on ADHD.   Nevertheless, some areas of neuroscience, such as neurochemistry, have shown a more modest progress, still majorly relying on either\n  post-mortem  \nor more indirect approaches.   Given this framework, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) appears to be a link to partially fill in this gap and promote an upgraded landscape on the study of the biochemistry of living tissues.  \n\nMRS is a technique based on the concept of chemical shift, which describes how electronic shielding of an atomic nucleus embedded in a more complex chemical compound \u2013 i.e., a nucleus not free \u2013 changes its resonance frequency.   This allows us to establish different fingerprints to different molecules based on specific resonance frequencies of protons and estimate their amount on a certain pre-specified volume of interest. Following this principle, some molecules are classically found on MRS studies of neural tissue, such as n-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, myo-inositol, and lactate.  \n\nThe first MRS studies of the brain of living organisms were performed in the 1980s,   whereas ADHD spectroscopy began in the early 2000s   ; the technique has been progressively more used since then. Nonetheless, the increasing amount of data available regarding this approach has revealed to be somehow problematic for those willing to summarize the knowledge generated, especially on the grounds of methodological heterogeneity within studies focusing on the same disease. There are at least three levels of variation among MRS studies. First of all, the voxels studied greatly vary for each design. Secondly, not all the studies identify the same metabolites. Finally, there is no standard unit for the results. In an MRS chart, one axis indicates frequency, and the other identifies an arbitrary unit influenced by many factors such as voxel size and radiofrequency coil sensitivity.   In addition to that, some authors use pure metabolite quantifications, whilst others prefer ratios of metabolites, usually using creatine as a baseline.  \n\nThe present study aims to delineate a method for grouping the data of MRS studies of patients with ADHD. More specifically, we describe a methodology for creating a systematic review and meta-analysis for this kind of scientific evidence. As a meta-analysis combines statistical findings of different studies addressing the same scientific problem to extract a single result, it seems to qualify as an appropriate method to tackle the difficulties found in the field.   Our main goal in this protocol is to describe a methodology capable of circumventing the aforementioned setbacks of merging spectroscopy results. Hopefully, with this work, we will be able to establish whether there are consistent differences among brain metabolites of patients with ADHD and those of healthy controls, and additionally, in doing so, to evaluate the reliability of the MRS approach as performed thus far. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis protocol has already been registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; https:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/prospero) under the title \u201cMagnetic resonance spectroscopy on attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis\u201d and ID number CRD42018112418. The outline of our protocol is in accordance with the 17-item checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015).  \n\n### Search on databases \n  \nWe are going to look for studies that measure brain metabolites through MRS in patients with ADHD and healthy controls. Using specific keywords previously selected (\n \n), we are going to perform searches on the following databases: Embase, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science. We also plan on looking for unpublished works on ERIC, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), CINAHL Database, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, using the keywords \u201cADHD\u201d and\/or \u201cAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\u201d for the condition, and \u201cMRS,\u201d \u201cMR spectroscopy,\u201d and\/or simply \u201cspectroscopy\u201d for the technique. No restriction will be imposed on language or year of publication. All entries will be recorded in a comprehensive list. Duplicates will be removed and the remainder records will form the final list for eligibility evaluation. Once the studies are selected, we are going to look for further potential candidate articles in the reference lists of all the studies included (\n \n). \n\n   Databases and keywords    \n\n\n### Study identification and selection \n  \nTwo authors will independently analyze the whole list of studies to assess eligibility. Their evaluation will be matched for each entry and divergences (through percentage and Kappa statistics: \u03ba \u2261 (po \u2013 pe)\/(1-pe) = 1 \u2013 (1-po)\/(1-pe), where\n  po  \nis the relative observed agreement among raters (accuracy), and\n  pe  \nis the hypothetical probability of chance agreement. Whenever divergences are found, the articles will be finally assessed by a third author. In a first approach, studies not related to our investigation will be excluded on the basis of title and abstract. All remaining entries will be subjected to full-text reading, when other studies might be ruled out. \n\nThe following inclusion criteria will be considered: 1) all studies must contain at least one group with patients with ADHD and one group with healthy controls; 2) all studies must contain original proton MRS data on brain metabolites. When more than one diagnosis is considered, the studies will be included if there is a group comprised of patients with ADHD only. Cases will be defined as individuals diagnosed with ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM-III) (attention deficit disorder [ADD]), DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5 through either professional direct evaluation or screening tools, for which the diagnostic value relies on the evaluation of the authors of each study. There will be no age, sex, or ethnicity restrictions. Controls will be defined as individuals verified as not having the condition through either professional direct evaluation or screening tools also based on DSM-III (ADD), DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5 criteria. No screening for other psychiatric conditions will be required, neither for cases nor for controls; this information will nonetheless be used as a quality criterion to be evaluated in our bias assessment, as described hereinafter. \n\n\n### Study characteristics to be extracted \n  \nExtraction of data from each study will retrieve the following characteristics: year of publication, sample size of each group, male-to-female ratio in each group, aimed population (children\/adolescents or adults), mean age of each group, regions of the brain studied, metabolites measured, and main results. The extraction will be performed by two authors, and divergences will be addressed by a third author. General principles of extraction followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  \n\nData directly related to the meta-analysis \u2013 i.e., mean metabolite measurement, standard deviation (or standard error), and sample size for each group (cases and controls) \u2013 will be recorded on independent worksheets, one for each brain region selected. The preferable sources are tables and written data on the article\u2019s full text. When the information is not detected on these formats, graph estimation using a digital ruler   will be performed. In case the previous methods are not available in the study or supplemental material, an email requesting the information will be dispatched for the correspondence address indicated in the authors\u2019 section of the article. If there is no response in two months, the data will be deemed as missing. Two authors will collect the data independently, and disparities will be corrected by discussion consulting the original source. \n\n\n### Selection of brain regions for meta-analysis \n  \nConsidering the heterogeneity of voxel choice among studies, it is important to delineate our approach on grouping data for the meta-analysis. While we anticipate that some degree of subjectivity will be unavoidable, we expect to proceed in a roughly systematic manner, as follows: on a first level, if enough studies are available, we will group data that target specifically the same regions (e.g., left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex); if not enough studies are available, we will combine more comprehensive data, but still on areas spatially related (e.g., left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex); lastly, if the previous methods are not feasible, we intend to incorporate data from similar structures, disregarding laterality. \n\n\n### Bias assessment \n  \nRisk of bias will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)   in its case-control study format. The NOS is a quality scale composed of nine items grouped within three sections: selection, comparability, and exposure. Selection bias is assessed by four questions regarding definition of cases, representativeness of cases, definition of controls, and selection of controls. Quality of comparability between cases and controls is evaluated by a sole topic divided in two items that estimates how well controlled the healthy control group was. Finally, excellence on exposure measures is assessed by three items focusing on quality of records, methods of ascertainment for cases and controls, and non-response rate. The NOS provides a scale from 0 to 9, one point for each of the items mentioned, the final score being related to the quality of the study in a direct fashion. Two authors will perform the NOS evaluation for each study, and the disparities on matched results will be discussed among the evaluators on the basis of the methodological description of the studies. Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression test. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### \nMeta-analysis\n \n  \nStudies will be grouped according to the aforementioned criteria and a meta-analysis will be performed for each metabolite of each region that meets a minimum of three values coming from at least three different studies. In articles with more than one ADHD group available (e.g., \u201ctreatment na\u00efve ADHD group\u201d and \u201con stimulants ADHD group\u201d) in a way that the data cannot be coupled, all ADHD groups will be matched against the control group, with the sample size of the healthy control group divided by the number of ADHD groups rounded down. As for the example given, if both a \u201ctreatment na\u00efve group\u201d and an \u201con stimulants group\u201d are present, both will be fully used as case groups, but matched against a control group divided by two (the number of case groups that meets the eligibility criteria), considering that the control group would be otherwise counted twice. Additionally, when combining different data from the same study (e.g., disregarding lateralization in a study with data from both sides of the brain, hence using two different sets of data from the same study, one for each side), both cases and controls will be divided by two and rounded down. These steps aim to avoid overestimation of sample sizes and both may be applied to the same work simultaneously if needed. \n\nStandardized mean differences obtained through Hedge\u2019s G method with random effects will be employed to determine pooled effect sizes. Significance will be established by a Z-test. Inverse variance will be used to determine individual study weights. Studies will also be assessed on their heterogeneity using the \u03c7   and I   tests, considering p \u2264 0.01 as statistically significant. Low, moderate, and high heterogeneity values will be assumed from I   values of 25, 50, and 75%, respectively.   In light of the fact that the possible use of effect sizes from the same study would artificially decrease heterogeneity, we will employ a three-level analysis adopting \u201cstudy\u201d as an extra random variable. The R package\n  meta  \nwill be used to assess standardized mean differences and heterogeneity values as well as to generate forest plots.  \n\n\n#### \nSensitivity of analysis\n \n  \nWe will perform sensitivity analyses in order to evaluate methodological disparities that might account for effect size differences. First, we intend to use the jackknife method to assess how dissonant studies might be affecting the outcome, excluding one result at a time from each meta-analysis; second, we will execute the analyses again after excluding studies with high risk of bias or rated as \u201cunclear risk of bias\u201d through a score related to our bias assessment from the NOS, as previously described, excluding studies rated as lower than one standard deviation from the mean (bootstrapping will be used to acquire normal distributions and set the thresholds in case the data is non-parametric); and third, we will divide the groups by age, gender, and field strength of the machinery, when enough data is available. Finally, we foresee an additional analysis including only published works to be performed as well. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe MRS seems to be a useful technique for in vivo brain investigations, especially when considering the limited availability of methods for studying neurochemistry in living neural tissue. The main limitation of this approach is that its use is only possible when high concentrations of metabolites are available (in the millimolar range), once the magnetic resonance method is poorly sensitive. Also, on a practical level, there is a significant spectral overlap among many compounds, making its discrimination a particular challenge.   Even so, it is quite puzzling that MRS is not more often used as a way of investigation. Some reasons for that might be speculated. First, the meaning of MRS results might still not be intuitively grasped on a physiological level \u2013 not in a degree that most scientists feel comfortable to rely on. In this sense, it is worth mentioning that more established methods, such as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, although probably to a different degree, can also fall in similar pitfalls.   Apart from that, MRS endures serious heterogeneity among studies, such as varying voxel of choice, occasional disparities on emphasized metabolites, and the absence of a standardized unit of measurement, all of which undermine its long-term technical appraisal. \n\nIn addition to undermining our interpretation of the data, the diversity observed in the use of this technology thus far is a particular obstacle for developing a protocol that aims to combine multiple results in one coherent statistical value. In previous meta-analyses of MRS data, different approaches were employed to address these problems. Concerning pooling brain regions, for instance, we observed that, while some studies do not detail their methods on this point, options included disregarding the brain area of source   \u2013 reasonable for specific neurological issues when functionality is not a primary concern for study purposes \u2013; pre-specifying brain regions to be studied as inclusion criteria   ; choosing a preferable brain side of source when information from both hemispheres is available   ; and stratifying the data in brain lobes.   Meta-analyses also diverge on how to address metabolite measures. While most works screen for all the main proton MRS molecules,   some choose to focus on specific frequency ranges.   We chose to preliminarily include all studies that met our eligibility criteria and subsequently delineate a hierarchical order of preference for merging the outcomes. With this approach, we hope to compile the data in a way that is both comprehensive and as specific as possible. \n\nAnother challenge in evaluating MRS studies concerns an early methodological issue. As it is commonly true for many neuroimaging works, the sample size available is typically small, which brings an extra dilemma into question, as false positive and false negative results are more likely to align, creating a troublesome picture of the variables being studied. Given this framework, a comprehensive portrayal of state-of-the-art MRS knowledge for any given disease often proves to be problematic. In this protocol overview, we presented a model of summarization for MRS data from the prototypical case of ADHD. By following this protocol, we expect to be able to successfully group the data available on MRS metabolites and ADHD in order to achieve unified results for different brain regions in the form of multiple meta-analyses, despite the great diversity of methodological approaches among studies. Additionally, we hope to assess the quality of the MRS case-control studies produced and, as multiple studies align, to indirectly evaluate the reliability of the technique as designed thus far. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nWhereas this approach represents our best efforts on unifying MRS data from different studies, an important drawback of this design must be mentioned. When merging mean results obtained for metabolites, we are, so to say, considering that all works involved are targeting specifically the same areas, while we know that this is arguably never the case, even when the same equipment and personnel are involved. On a larger scale, we are likely to have to occasionally merge data from different voxels on the basis of neuroanatomy and neurofunctional proximity, as described on our methods. Regarding this limitation, we believe it is important to acknowledge that MRS is an estimation of brain metabolite concentrations within a given volume of interest rather than a fine magnifier of brain neurochemistry, its contribution being more on a macroscopic scale. Even so, when present, this problem should be addressed and examined considering its own significance. Illustrations of the brain indicating the disparities and overlap among studies, as in a sort of neural Venn diagram, will hopefully help to discuss the reliability of each result. \n\nAnother limitation of our protocol refers to our broad inclusion criteria, which will include different diagnostic methods and mostly rely on the judgment of the authors of each study, probably blending different diagnostic rationales and different presentations of the same disorder. Nevertheless, at present, this seems to be the only way to pool a reasonable amount of data for our purposes. Also, our primary goal is to investigate MRS metabolites in the general diagnostic standard currently available. As we are still working on a symptom-based approach for diagnosis in psychiatry, biological parameters still have to derive from non-biological clustering, and only subsequent analyses will be able to provide data for different methods in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we believe that our protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis might prove helpful in broadening the use of MRS data. MRS is a potentially fruitful approach for neuroscientific endeavor, and the body of knowledge already generated from it can be used to draw a unified understanding of metabolite concentrations for specific disorders. The heterogeneity in brain areas studied and the need for broad inclusion criteria due to the relatively low number of studies available would probably be the main limitations of our approach. Even so, we hope that our methodology will support us to gather multiple estimates of how much of a substance is present in living neural tissue, opening a vast window of investigation for which the full employment remains to be explored. Therefore, following this protocol will potentially allow us to use the MRS data produced so far to enlighten our current understanding of either ADHD or any other brain disorder. Last, in succeeding in our purpose, we would conceivably provide a background capable of encouraging more systematic approaches to MRS studies. \n\n   Meta-analysis data extraction.

Here we performed a systematic, participant-level meta-analysis of experimental functional neuroimaging studies of evoked pain under stimulus-intensity-matched placebo and control conditions, encompassing 603 healthy participants from 20 (out of 28 eligible) studies. We find that placebo vs. control treatments induce small, widespread reductions in pain-related activity, particularly in regions belonging to ventral attention (including mid-insula) and somatomotor networks (including posterior insula). Behavioral placebo analgesia correlates with reduced pain-related activity in these networks and the thalamus, habenula, mid-cingulate, and supplementary motor area. Placebo-associated activity increases occur mainly in frontoparietal regions, with high between-study heterogeneity. We conclude that placebo treatments affect pain-related activity in multiple brain areas, which may reflect changes in nociception and\/or other affective and decision-making processes surrounding pain. Between-study heterogeneity suggests that placebo analgesia is a multi-faceted phenomenon involving multiple cerebral mechanisms that differ across studies. \n  \nThe neural mechanisms of placebo analgesia are not fully understood. Here the authors conducted a large scale meta-analysis of individual data from fMRI studies of pain and placebo conditions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPlacebo effects contribute substantially to treatment outcomes in both medical research and clinical practice. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is thus important for optimizing drug development and clinical care . Placebo analgesia is the most robust and best-studied type of placebo effect . A growing number of neuroimaging studies elucidate the brain correlates of placebo analgesia. These studies, and meta-analyses of their findings, have provided evidence for the involvement of brain regions linked to nociceptive processing, including early pain-gating mechanisms, but also to decision-making, cognitive appraisal, reward\/motivation, emotional regulation , and other forms of learning and social cognition  relevant for health behaviors. \n\nNevertheless, the results of these studies vary substantially , and the lack of large-sample assessments hampers the detection of small to moderate effects  and makes it difficult to identify precisely which structures are consistently altered by placebo treatment. Previous meta-analyses have all relied on published coordinates of activation peaks. These incomplete summaries of the full activation maps provide only approximate information on replicability across studies and are susceptible to bias . These limitations can be overcome by meta-analyses based on single-participant, whole-brain images, which are sometimes referred to as \u2018mega-analyses\u2019 . As meta-analyses on participant-level data are preferable in terms of statistical power and risk-of-bias , a mega-analysis of placebo-induced brain activity can be expected to foster convergence in our understanding of placebo analgesia, to provide novel insights into the underlying neural mechanisms, and guide the development of predictive methods of individual placebo analgesia from neuroimaging data, which would be of crucial importance both from a clinical and drug development point of view. Here, we conducted a systematic participant-level meta-analysis of 20 independent neuroimaging studies on experimental placebo analgesia. Based on whole-brain activation patterns in a total of   N  \u2009=\u2009603 healthy participants, we mapped the effects of placebo treatment on pain-related brain activity and identified neural correlates of individual differences in behavioral placebo analgesia. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Image quality \n  \nAll included studies (  N  \u2009=\u2009603 participants from 20 studies, see ref.   and Table\u00a0 ) aimed at covering the whole brain down to the mid-pons\/superior cerebellar level. Image alignment to MNI-space was satisfactory for all studies, but coverage was often incomplete near the boundaries of the brain (see Supplementary Figs.\u00a0  and  ), particularly in the inferior brainstem, cerebellum, and ventral prefrontal regions. These partially missing data are likely due to between-study differences in field-of-view and\/or signal dropout artifacts. For one study , only maps with white-matter regions masked out were available.   \nStudies included in the meta-analysis. \n  \n A   Sub-study 1,   B   Sub-study 2,   between   between-group design, cap, capsaicin,   cond   conditioning,   IV   intravenous,   L   left,   NA   not available,   R   right,   sug   suggestions,   TENS   transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,   within   within-subject design. \n\nPlacebo-treatment groups, only. \n  \n\nOutlier screening (see Supplementary Methods and Results) indicated pain ratings that were too low for inclusion in six participants (responses <5% of the pain scale). Problematic image features were found in 12 (2.0%) participants. These include imaging artifacts (six participants), extreme values (four participants), or likely errors in first-level analysis (two participants). These outlier participants were retained in our analysis (see Supplementary Methods and Results, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 ,\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0  for an analysis excluding high risk-of-bias studies and outlier participants, which shows similar results to the full sample analysis in terms of effect sizes). \n\n\n### Voxel-wise results: pain stimulation effects \n  \nPainful stimulation compared to baseline induced large peak effects (  g  \u2009>\u20090.8); with the largest located in the insula, bilaterally (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). In general, cerebral activations and de-activations were found in regions typical for experimental pain (compare: Fig.\u00a0  and ref.  ). The   \u03c4  -statistic indicated considerable between-study heterogeneity in pain-related activity throughout most of the brain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), which was expected given the large inter-study diversity regarding experimental pain-induction, image acquisition, and image processing (Supplementary Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ).    Pain-related activity in experimental placebo imaging studies.  \n a   Statistically significant pain-responses (permutation test, controlled for FWER, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.05), and   b   whole-brain unthresholded standardized effect size   g  , of acute pain stimulation > baseline, pooled across placebo and control conditions (FWER-corrected permutation test results are delineated as a back contour); range   g  : [\u22120.82, 1.68]; all:   n  \u2009=\u2009543\u2013603 individuals from 17 to 20 independent studies per voxel. Three-dimensional coronal slices are equidistantly distributed from   y  \u2009=\u200960 to \u221268\u2009mm. Axial slices range equidistantly from   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221222 to 42\u2009mm. Custom coordinates for sagittal slices are displayed in mm. Source data (results as 3d-volumes) are provided at  . \n  \n\n\n### Voxel-wise results: effect of placebo treatment \n  \nIn general, placebo treatment had a small (  g  \u2009<\u20090.2) effect on pain-related brain activity, as compared to the matched control conditions (Fig.\u00a0 ). Significant placebo-associated decreases were found in the right insula, near the habenula and the splenium of the corpus callosum, and in the cerebellum (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWER corrected with pTFCE; Fig.\u00a0  light blue, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). No areas showed placebo-related increases at the FWER-corrected threshold treating study as a random effect.    Placebo-induced changes in pain-related activity.  \n a   Areas of statistically significant placebo treatment effect, assuming random study-effect, thresholded according to   z-  tests (uncorrected for multiple comparisons, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, red and blue) and thresholded according to pTFCE-enhanced permutation test (controlled for FWER, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, light blue, activity increases did not reach statistical significance);   b   unthresholded standardized effect size   g   of placebo treatment effect (range: [\u22120.19, 0.17]);   c   between-study heterogeneity   \u03c4   (range: [0, 0.43]) with permutation test results (controlled for FWER, one-sided,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, green);   \u03c4   is plotted as   \u03c4   to emphasize regions of high heterogeneity.   d   significant placebo-effects assuming fixed study-effect (range: [\u22120.22, 0.22]) thresholded according to   z-  tests (uncorrected for multiple comparisons, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, red and blue) and thresholded according to pTFCE-enhanced permutation test (controlled for FWER, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, light blue and gold); all:   n  \u2009=\u2009543 to 603 individuals from 17 to 20 independent studies per voxel.   b  ,   c  , and   d   are shown with a contour of FWER-corrected permutation test results for pain > baseline, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Small FWER-corrected clusters are zoomed in insets. Three-dimensional coronal slices are equidistantly distributed from   y  \u2009=\u200960 to \u221268\u2009mm. Axial slices range equidistantly from   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221222 to 42\u2009mm. Custom coordinates for sagittal slices are displayed in mm and were chosen to highlight important areas of activation. Source data (results as 3d-volumes) are provided at  . \n  \n\nEstimated between-study heterogeneity in voxel-level effect sizes was low in the significantly de-activated regions (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). However, many regions of the brain showing sub-threshold placebo-related increases showed statistically significant   \u03c4  -values, indicating between-study heterogeneity in effects (Fig.\u00a0 ). These included multiple prefrontal cortical areas, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, basal ganglia, and the left middle insula. A brain-wide correlation analysis indicated that placebo treatment effects were positively and significantly correlated across brain regions with   \u03c4  -values (  r  \u2009=\u20090.191, 95% CI [0.187, 0.196],   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ), indicating that areas showing placebo-induced increases tended to have higher levels of between-study heterogeneity. Thus, activation increases varied more substantially across studies than activation decreases. \n\nWe therefore performed an exploratory fixed-study-effects analysis of placebo effects, which tests for effects within this set of studies without the intent of generalizing to new, unobserved studies. In addition to decreases reported above, this analysis showed reduced activity in the middle cingulate cortex, the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), left fusiform cortex and cerebellum (Fig.\u00a0 , light blue). The fixed-effects analysis revealed significant placebo-induced activation in the anterior intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Fig.\u00a0  gold, Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\nTo further follow up on potential sources of between-study heterogeneity, we explored the possibility of explaining heterogeneity through study-level experimental features, such as the method of placebo induction. A preliminary comparison of placebo induction methods (conditioning and suggestions versus suggestions only) showed no significant differences in placebo-related brain activity after correction for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Voxel-wise results: correlations with placebo analgesia \n  \nIn the vast majority of voxels (Fig.\u00a0 ), placebo analgesia was negatively correlated with placebo-induced changes in brain activity. Thus, the larger the activity decreases, the more analgesia a participant reported (Fig.\u00a0 , blue and light blue). Negative correlations were strongest and statistically significant in the bilateral thalamus, right anterior, middle and posterior insula, right secondary somatosensory cortex, right superior temporal gyrus, right cerebellum (around the dorsal part of lobule VI), basal ganglia, the mid-cingulate cortex, as well as SMA\/pre-SMA (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWER corrected with pTFCE; Fig.\u00a0  light blue; also see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). The activity of contralateral (left) areas of the insula (  z-score  \u2009=\u20093.9,   r  \u2009=\u20090.17,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00005), the secondary somatosensory cortex (  z-score  \u2009=\u20094.0,   r  \u2009=\u20090.21,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00003) was also negatively correlated with analgesia but was only significant without correcting for multiple comparisons (Fig.\u00a0 , blue).    Correlations of behavioral placebo analgesia and changes in pain-related brain activity.  \n a   Whole-brain areas of statistically significant correlation (Pearson\u2019s   r  ) between behavioral placebo analgesia (pain \u2009\u2212\u2009pain ) and placebo-related activity changes (pain \u2009\u2212\u2009pain ), thresholded according to   z-  tests (uncorrected for multiple comparisons, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, red and blue), and thresholded according to pTFCE-enhanced permutation test (controlled for FWER, two-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, light blue, increased correlations did not reach corrected statistical significance);   b   unthresholded Pearson\u2019s   r  , range: [\u22120.26; 0.17];   c   between-study heterogeneity   \u03c4   (range: [0, 0.32]) for the same relationship (permutation test controlled for FWER, one-sided   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, indicated no statistically significant voxels);   \u03c4   is plotted as   \u03c4   to emphasize regions of high heterogeneity. all:   n  \u2009=\u2009384\u2013460 individuals from 15 to 18 independent studies per voxel.   a  ,   b  , and   c   are shown with a contour of FWER-corrected permutation test results for pain > baseline, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Correlations were computed across individual participants in the full sample, excluding between-group studies (where individual estimates of behavioral placebo analgesia are not possible). On panels   a   and   b  , red-yellow and blue-light blue shades denote increased and decreased activity associated with larger placebo analgesia, respectively. Three-dimensional coronal slices are equidistantly distributed from   y  \u2009=\u200960 to \u221268\u2009mm. Axial slices range equidistantly from   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221222 to 42\u2009mm. Custom coordinates for sagittal slices are displayed in mm. Source data (results as 3d-volumes) are provided at  . \n  \n\nPositive correlations between behavioral placebo analgesia and brain activity, i.e. increasing brain activity with stronger placebo response, did not reach statistical significance (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWER corrected, pTFCE). Without correcting for multiple comparisons, positive correlations (Fig.\u00a0 , red) were observed near the subgenual cingulate cortex (  z-  score\u2009=\u20091.8,   r  \u2009=\u20090.14,   p  \u2009=\u20090.036), in the orbitofrontal cortex (  z-  score\u2009=\u20092.7,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.17,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003), and the prefrontal pole (  z-  score\u2009=\u20092.6,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.13,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005). \n\nLevels of between-study heterogeneity were negligible in regions showing significant correlations between behavioral placebo analgesia and brain activity (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ), suggesting that correlations were driven by inter-individual differences rather than systematic differences across studies. Across the brain, between-study heterogeneity did not reach FWER significance, but was largest in the basal ganglia, orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices; see Fig.\u00a0 ). Between-study heterogeneity was not spatially associated with correlations across voxels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ); thus, the most heterogeneous regions were not those with the strongest effects. \n\n\n### Network- and region-based results: effects of painful stimulation \n  \nActivation for painful stimulation compared to baseline (averaged across placebo and control conditions) showed activation of multiple expected cortical and subcortical regions (Fig.\u00a0 , Column 2). These included activation in the ventral attention network (which encompasses the insulae), the fronto-parietal network , and the somatomotor network. Positive associations were also found in all insular sub-regions and most thalamic nuclei, including the intralaminar nuclei targeted by ascending nociceptive pathways, the mediodorsal \u2018limbic association\u2019 nucleus, and the ventro-basal complex, including the ventro-posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus . A tendency towards negative associations was found for the lateral geniculate, medial geniculate, and pulvinar nuclei, which are known for their predominantly visual and auditory roles .

In the insula, placebo reduced activity in bilateral middle short gyrus and right posterior short gyrus, corresponding to the dorsal anterior\/mid-insula, as well as a trend towards reduced activity in the right anterior long gyrus (posterior insula, contralateral to stimulation in most studies). Thalamic nuclei showed tendencies towards placebo-induced decreases in areas strongly activated in pain. The strongest decreases were found in the VPL, a primary target of the spinothalamic tract, and the habenula. Observed placebo effects in other regions tended to be smaller. \n\n\n### Network- and region-based results: correlations with placebo analgesia \n  \nAs with the main effects of placebo vs. control, network similarity-based analysis of regions correlated with placebo analgesia indicated that activity in the ventral attention and somatomotor networks was negatively correlated with behavioral placebo responses (Fig.\u00a0 ), i.e., strong placebo responders showed larger deactivation with placebo treatment. Within the right insula, several regions tended towards negative correlations with placebo responses, especially the anterior long gyrus (posterior insula), middle short gyrus (dorsal anterior\/mid insula), and anterior inferior cortex (ventral insula). In the thalamus, stronger placebo analgesia was correlated with reductions in multiple thalamic regions, including all seven regions that responded strongly to pain in this sample (intralaminar, ventrolateral, ventral anterior, ventromedial, mediodorsal, antero-medial, and anterio-ventral nuclear groups), and thalamic targets of the spinothalamic tract (ventro-posterior-lateral [VPL] and -medial [VPM]). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this collaborative effort, we performed a comprehensive, large-scale (  N  \u2009=\u2009603) participant-level voxel-based neuroimaging meta-analysis of placebo analgesia, involving the majority of eligible experimental neuroimaging studies. Our results provide a reliable, aggregated view of the size, localization, significance, and heterogeneity of placebo-effects on pain-induced brain activity. In a previous paper, we focused on the question of whether placebo analgesia involves changes in the neurologic pain signature (NPS) , a machine-learning based weighted, multi-voxel summary metric (covering about 10% of the brain), that can be interpreted as a neuromarker of nociceptive pain. This previous study revealed that behavioral placebo analgesia was associated with significant but small effects in the NPS, pointing to the relevance of other brain areas and networks. Accordingly, characterizing this potentially broader set of changes was the key focus of this voxel-wise whole-brain investigation (for a comparison with regions involved in the NPS, see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The present results corroborated previous findings of increases in frontal-parietal regions and reductions in the insula. In addition, they revealed new effects systematically missed in previous smaller-scale analyses, including reductions in the habenula, specific parts of the thalamus (particularly VPL, a nociceptive nucleus), and the cerebellum, promising new targets in explaining placebo analgesia. \n\nHere, we discuss our results in correspondence to two key open questions: (i) how strongly do placebo treatments affect the same systems involved in nociception and pain generation (as indicated by the contrast control\u2009>\u2009placebo); and (ii) which systems are engaged by placebo treatments (as indicated by the contrast placebo\u2009>\u2009control) and may therefore reflect top-down modulatory mechanisms. \n\nOur study-as-random-effect results provide strong evidence for placebo-associated reductions of pain-related activity in some brain areas linked to nociception and pain and indicate that these are generalizable across experimental paradigms. We also provide strong evidence that the degree to which pain-related activity is reduced in these brain areas correlates with the magnitude of behavioral hypoalgesia across individuals. \n\nSpecifically, the placebo-associated decrease and its correlation with behavioral pain ratings were most prominent in regions located within the ventral attention and the somatomotor cortical networks, including the anterior insula and targets of the spinothalamic tract , including the thalamic VPL complex the posterior insula and, moreover, in the habenula (Figs.\u00a0 b and  ; Fig.\u00a0 , Column 3 and 4). Correlations were additionally pronounced in both lateral (VL and VPM\/VPL) and medial (intralaminar and MD) thalamic nuclei (Fig.\u00a0 ). These regions are targets of ascending nociceptive systems and, as expected, were also strongly engaged during painful stimulation. In summary, placebo-associated down-regulation seems to affect thalamocortical pathways related to nociception and pain , particularly in strong placebo responders. The relatively low between-study heterogeneity in these regions indicates that variability in placebo-related reductions is primarily a function of the individual responder rather than the paradigm used. \n\nThese findings complement previous findings of small but statistically significant placebo-induced reductions in the NPS . In this previous study, NPS reductions also correlated with the magnitude of placebo analgesia. Here, findings of VPL reductions with placebo and widespread correlations between analgesia and correlations in broadly pain-related systems support the conclusion that alterations in nociception and pain construction are an important element of placebo analgesia. The small effect sizes however indicate that nociceptive changes are unlikely to be a complete explanation. The strengths of the previous NPS findings were that the neuromarker was identified independently from the present sample and validated in over 40 published cohorts to date. However, limitations were that (1) the NPS may not perfectly characterize nociceptive processing in this sample, and some nociceptive pain-related effects may be missed; (2) it cannot provide a broad view of effects across the brain, including areas like the habenula and many cortical areas; and (3) it tests a distributed pattern response and is not suited to identify placebo effects in VPL (or any other region) in particular. The present findings of effects in specific thalamic and other regions are complementary and important, in that they provide a region-level inference about effects in neuroanatomically defined nociceptive pathways. Thus, overall, we believe that placebo effects affect the circuitry involved in pain generation to some degree, in a manner that varies across individuals more than across studies in the present dataset, but also includes other brain effects beyond nociception that may be important for the emotions, decision-making, and behaviors surrounding pain. \n\nPlacebo-related decreases were not restricted to pathways associated with nociception. Brain regions traditionally linked to self-regulation and high-level action selection, particularly the SMA  also showed reduced activity during placebo analgesia, particularly in strong placebo responders (Figs.\u00a0  and  ). Thus, it is possible that some of these effects reflect shifts in motivation and decision-making in the context of pain. These findings extend previous meta-analyses, which all highlighted de-activations in the mid-cingulate, but not the SMA or pre-motor areas . In addition to action planning and self-regulation, they may be related to other cognitive operations related to evaluating pain under placebo treatment, including error monitoring, prediction errors, and sequence processing . \n\nOne of the strongest effects was found in the left putamen, which de-activated with placebo in proportion to analgesia. This is in line with multiple studies reporting correlations between placebo analgesia and both fronto-parietal and limbic fronto-striatal pathways  and might be related to the (prefrontal) suppression of striatal prediction errors or other aversive circuits . \n\nInterestingly, each of the main analyses revealed prominent placebo-related reductions in cerebellar regions. While this in line with some previous findings (e.g. ), cerebellar effects were not reported in previous meta-analyses of placebo analgesia, possibly due to insufficient cerebellar coverage across studies. Here, the dorsomedial cerebellum showed a profile of responses to painful events, reductions with placebo, and correlations with the magnitude of placebo analgesia. Some\u00a0cerebellar regions have been linked to pain, and others to other cognitive, affective, and motor processes  and patients with cerebellar infarctions show reduced placebo analgesia . Cerebellar reductions and correlations are centered in vermis areas V and (to a lesser degree) II , which are associated with somatomotor and limbic cortical networks, respectively. Thus, the best interpretation of cerebellar effects here is that they are related partly, but not exclusively, to somatomotor networks and pain. Placebo hypoalgesia-related activity changes in the VL nucleus, a target of cerebellothalamic tract , also suggest that fronto-cerebellar connectivity may pose a promising novel target for future in-depth studies on the mechanisms of placebo analgesia. \n\nIn contrast to these placebo-related deactivations, some regions displayed increased pain-related activity as an effect of placebo treatment, which is often interpreted as participating in the construction of top-down representations of context (including beliefs and expectations). These regions tend to be localized in the frontoparietal network (FPN). These increases were statistically significant only in the fixed effect analysis and involved the right DLPFC (with subthreshold activation on the left side), as well as the bilateral intraparietal sulcus. While the fixed-effect analysis provides limited generalizability, this result is very much in line with previous neuroimaging studies highlighting the importance of the DLPFC in initiating and maintaining the top-down effect of treatment expectation on nociceptive processing and pain. E.g. activity in the DLPFC precedes and scales with activity changes in downstream pain modulatory areas and prevents the extinction of once learned placebo analgesia . Moreover, transient inhibition of the DLPFC using transcranial magnetic stimulation led to reduced placebo analgesia . \n\nThe lack of FWER-corrected increases might be attributed to the reduced power in the study-as-random-effect analysis, which is very conservative. However, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that the between-study variance is significantly higher than expected in key fronto-parietal areas (Fig.\u00a0 ). This suggests that, in contrast to the consistent placebo-induced decreases across studies, placebo-related increases in brain activity are more heterogenous across placebo induction techniques. For instance, significant heterogeneity in the DLPFC and perigenual ACC might reflect the differing engagement of descending pain regulatory mechanisms across studies, although these regions are clearly not exclusively associated with pain modulation (e.g. see ref.  ). \n\nBetween-study heterogeneity was statistically significant throughout the frontal lobe (Fig.\u00a0 ), which may reflect inter-study variation in participants\u2019 appraisal of the context and internal responses, e.g., expectations . The degree to which prefrontal systems are required for analgesia may vary. For example, in ref.  , placebo analgesia was predicted by fronto-parietal activity in regions associated with emotion regulation but not working memory. Emotion regulation, in particular reappraisal strategies involving self-generated positive contexts for experiences, appears to involve fronto-parietal networks in reducing negative affect. Other recent studies have also found correlations between placebo analgesia and DLPFC connectivity  (e.g., with the nucleus accumbens ) and opioid binding in prefrontal cortex . By contrast, other studies have found that mindfulness practice can reduce pain without fronto-parietal activation or appreciable deactivation in spinothalamic targets . These strategies focus on acceptance without judgment rather than active re-contextualization, which may be another important component of placebo analgesia. \n\nIn sum, placebo analgesia may involve multiple alterations in appraisal systems, reflecting multiple underlying mechanisms . Our results suggest that placebo effects are not restricted solely to either sensory\/nociceptive or cognitive\/affective processes, but likely involve a combination of mechanisms that may differ depending on the paradigm and other individual factors. Understanding the neural and neurochemical pathways underlying this variability will pave the way to systematically utilize\/modulate placebo responses in a context-, patient-, and disease-specific manner. Fostering the therapeutic processes underlying placebo effects in clinical settings promises to boost the efficacy (and tolerability) of analgesic drug treatments. Likewise, controlling and homogenizing placebo responses during drug development can enhance the assay sensitivity in clinical trials. Finally, biomarkers based on the types of brain alterations we identify here, and reported in other studies , may help to dissect placebo from analgesic drug responses in pre-clinical trials. \n\nThe present findings must be interpreted in the light of several limitations. First, as our findings are based on experimental placebo interventions in healthy volunteers, they may not generalize to clinical settings. Second, the present study covered a wide range of experimental placebo paradigms and conditions. This is favorable in terms of establishing the broad generalizability of results, but it also means that findings have to generalize over many sources of variation: Paradigm, population\/sample, scanner, and choice of analysis methods. Effect size estimates are thus likely overly conservative compared with what may be possible as analysis methods continue to become standardized and methodological advances reduce inter-subject and inter-study variability. Further, the fact that this meta-analysis was based on participant-level statistical summary images from variety of different pre-processing pipelines (s. Supplementary Table\u00a0 ) likely had a negative impact on spatial brain mapping accuracy, in particular since different software packages  (and therefore MNI-templates ) and different spatial smoothing kernels were used. This study therefore trades off spatial precision for generalizability across scanners, populations, pipelines, and paradigms. Finally, some brain regions, notably the orbitofrontal cortex (including the vmPFC), the inferior cerebellum and the top-most part of the brain were not fully covered (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0  and  ) and placebo-related activation changes in these regions could not be assessed and may be missed. \n\nIn this systematic meta-analysis of individual participant data, we show that placebo treatments induce small, yet robust, inhibitory effects in large parts of the brain. These involve selected regions within the ventral attention and somatomotor networks, including targets of spinothalamic-afferents strongly linked to nociception, and are consistent across studies. Further, our study corroborates the relevance of placebo-related activity in fronto-parietal areas; however, the degree and relevance of fronto-parietal activity show large between-study heterogeneity. Our results suggest, that placebo is neither restricted to sensory\/nociceptive nor to selective cognitive\/affective processes but likely involves a combination of mechanisms that may differ depending on the paradigm and other individual factors. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe present study is a systematic meta-analysis of participant-level data across 20 published studies. A previous paper on this dataset  tested placebo effects on a single, a priori pain-related measure (the neurologic pain signature ). Here, we used the same data set to map placebo responses across the brain. In contrast to the previous analysis, which was restricted to the NPS as a neuromarker of nociceptive processing, this manuscript now focuses on voxel-wise brain-activity. This allows us to investigate placebo effects on individual regions and the distribution of effects across the brain, including in regions associated with affective and cognitive processes beyond nociception. \n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nAs previously described , we performed a systematic literature search to identify experimental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations of placebo analgesia (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0  and ref.   for details). Criteria for study eligibility were: (a) published in peer-reviewed journal in the English language; (b) original investigation; (c) human participants; (d) functional neuroimaging of the brain during evoked pain; (e) pain delivered under matched placebo and control conditions. Definitions of placebo and control conditions (see Supplementary Methods and Results) were identical to our previous meta-analysis . Investigators of eligible studies were contacted and invited to share data. We collected single-participant, first-level, whole-brain standard-space summary images of pain response (statistical parametric maps) from the original analyses, as published, as well as corresponding pain ratings, experimental design parameters, and demographic data (Supplementary Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ). \n\n\n### Outcome definition and comparisons \n  \nThe main outcome was pain-related change in fMRI signal (i.e., blood oxygen level-dependent signal, perfusion changes), i.e., the effect of painful stimulation compared to baseline, as estimated in the original analyses (i.e., beta or contrast images). Based on this outcome, we performed three comparisons: (i) main effect of pain vs baseline, averaging placebo and control conditions; (ii) pain-related activity acquired under matched placebo and control conditions (placebo\u2013control); and (iii), for studies that manipulated placebo vs. control within-subject, correlations across individuals between the effect of placebo treatment on brain activity and behavioral placebo analgesia (i.e., [placebo\u2013control] in pain ratings). \n\nNon-painful or mildly painful  stimulus conditions were excluded. For studies that involved left- and right-lateralized stimulation , strong and weak placebo conditions , or early- and late heat-pain periods  maps were averaged on subject level, as in the previous analysis  (see Supplementary Table\u00a0  for details). The main effect of pain vs baseline was averaged across placebo and control conditions (instead of just using no-placebo conditions) because for some studies  only pooled estimates of the main effect of pain were available (see Supplementary Methods and Results for details). \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \nWe applied the Cochrane risk of bias tool  to assess the risk-of-bias of included studies. (Supplementary Methods and Results and Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\nImages underwent systematic quality control, as described previously  (see Supplementary Methods and Results for details). Voxels missing in >10% of participants (  n  \u2009>\u200960) or outside of the MNI152 brain-template (as implemented in SPM12 , probability of brain tissue <50%) were excluded from analysis. \n\nOutcome assessment was performed in a mass-univariate fashion, separately for each brain voxel. To account for between-study differences in the scaling of pain reports and imaging data, we used standardized effect sizes rather than the raw values. Standardization of effect sizes (mean response to pain and its difference between placebo and control conditions) was based on the between-subject-level standard deviation of pain-related brain activity, separately for each study, by using Hedges\u2019   g   (Hedges\u2019   g   for within-subject studies ), a small-sample bias-corrected version of Cohen\u2019s   d  , commonly used in meta-analysis . Furthermore, we used Pearson\u2019s   r   to assess correlations between placebo analgesia and its effects on brain activity in studies with a within-subject design (18 studies, 460 participants). Study-level effect size estimates were summarized using the generic inverse-variance (GIV) weighting method, accounting for study as a random effect . Pearson\u2019s   r   was transformed to Fisher\u2019s   Z   for across-study averages and tests of statistical inference. Between-study heterogeneity in effect size was estimated using the   \u03c4  -statistic, which represents the study-level standard deviation of effect sizes . Effect size summaries and standard errors were used to calculate   z  -  and pseudo-  z  -scores , the latter was based on smoothened (4 * 4 * 4\u2009mm full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel) instead of raw standard errors, as described in ref.  . Voxel-wise   p  -values were obtained by performing a non-parametric permutation-test of the pseudo-z statistic , correcting for multiple comparisons at Family Wise Error (FWER) level, according to the maximum-z method . Permutation testing was performed at 1500 random permutations, small (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01)   p  -values were approximated by tail-fitting a generalized Pareto distribution . To perform a robust enhancement of spatially extended activations and, at the same time, allowing for simple   z-  score-based thresholding, we performed probabilistic threshold-free cluster enhancement (pTFCE) . Both enhanced and unenhanced   z-  score maps were thresholded at an FWER-corrected alpha level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. For visualization, unenhanced   z  -score maps were thresholded at an uncorrected alpha level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. All   p  -values presented are two-tailed. \n\nTo aid the interpretation of results, we utilized cosine similarity in an exploratory analysis comparing the participant-level contrast maps with brain-parcellation atlases representing (i) canonical large-scale functional connectivity networks  (resting-state), as well as (ii) insular sub-regions (anatomy based) , and (iii) thalamic nuclei (anatomy based) , i.e., the most prominent brain regions involved in pain processing . Note that the large-scale functional connectivity networks are based on resting-state data, thus reverse-inference and direct associations to task-based activity should be performed carefully. On the other hand, large-scale resting-state networks have de-facto evolved as standard means for brain-wide localization . Accordingly, we use these canonical networks solely for localization purposes. Obtained participant-level cosine similarity values were summarized using the GIV method, with statistics based on   t  -tests across studies, treating study as a random effect. No correction for multiple comparisons was performed for the atlas-based analyses due to their exploratory nature. Cosine similarity is equivalent to Pearson\u2019s correlation except for mean-centering, so it remains sensitive to the overall level of activation across the brain and thus reflects absolute normalized activity levels in the regions\/networks tested rather than relative activity across regions. \n\nAll analyses were performed with MATLAB 2016b, SPM12, the CANlab Core Tools neuroimaging analysis toolbox ( ), and custom functions implementing the GIV method. Further analysis details are provided in the Supplementary Methods and Results. \n\nMRIcroGL (v28.5.2017) was used to create illustrations of statistical parametric maps. All neuroimages shown follow the neurological convention (left side corresponds to left hemisphere in coronal- and axial-sections). Effect sizes are interpreted as small, moderate, and large according to the recommendations by Cohen . All result maps from this meta-analysis are available for download as 3d NIFTI images at  . \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0  linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7925520,"text_md5":"47f58e63cffd540c22cadabeaa296460","field_positions":{"authors":[0,87],"journal":[88,98],"publication_year":[100,104],"title":[115,213],"keywords":[227,305],"abstract":[318,1746],"body":[1755,42467]},"batch":1,"pmid":33654105,"doi":"10.1038\/s41467-021-21179-3","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7925520","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7925520"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7925520\">7925520<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7925520  Meta-analysis of neural systems underlying placebo analgesia from individual participant fMRI data"}
{"text":"Hong, Jian and Park, Jin-Hyuck\nInt J Environ Res Public Health, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nEfficacy of Neuro-Feedback Training for PTSD Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nPTSD\nPTSD symptoms\nneuro-feedback training\nNFT\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIf the negative emotions experienced in life become trauma, they affect daily life. Neuro-feedback technology has recently been introduced as a treatment, but many different neuro-feedback protocols and methods exits. This study conducted a meta-analysis of neuro-feedback training for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms to evaluate the effects of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neuro-feedback training. A search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from January 2011 to December 2021. The studies\u2019 quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and publication bias was assessed by Egger\u2019s regression test. Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria were used for the systematic review and meta-analysis. EEG was more effective than fMRI for PTSD symptoms, and the effect on PTSD symptoms was higher than on anxiety and depression. There was no difference in the effectiveness of the training sessions. Our findings showed that EEG-based neuro-feedback training was more helpful for training PTSD symptoms. Additionally, the methods were also shown to be valid for evaluating clinical PTSD diagnoses. Further research is needed to establish a gold standard protocol for the EEG-based neuro-feedback training (EEG-NFT) method for PTSD symptoms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMany individuals fail to endorse their negative reactions at the time of an event [ ]. It is estimated that one in ten people who experience trauma develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ ]. Like PTSD, mood indicators can comprise a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, guilt, or loneliness [ ] and have abnormal brain activity patterns [ ]. PTSD is characterized by re-experiencing a traumatic event and negative alterations in mood and cognition [ ]. PTSD symptoms affect personal and social life conditions [ ], and PTSD symptoms may vary in severity depending on the level of the symptoms the individual feels. The association between PTSD and deficits in emotion regulation is well established [ ]. PTSD is treated using four main therapeutic techniques [ ], which include cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR], and pharmacotherapy [ ]. However, there is no single standard treatment for PTSD [ ] and, especially in the case of pharmacotherapy, 41% of the patients who receive the treatment fail to respond [ ]. \n\nFor PTSD, self-regulation, increased neuroplasticity, and the recapture of the brain\u2019s functional network are the primary factors which are important in healing [ ]. Neuro-feedback (NF) is a relatively new technique that allows us to target certain brain areas for developing neuroscience-guided therapy [ ]. It is a form of behavioral training aimed at modifying the skills needed for the self-regulation of brain activity [ ]. Thus, in an alternative way, the use of NF avoids the potential triggering of negative experiences pertaining to the trauma [ ]. Several studies showed that NF could be helpful for patients with PTSD [ ]. By allowing us to self-regulate our brain activity [ ], neuronal activity and connectivity can be changed [ ], indirectly resulting in behavioral changes [ ]. Brain activity can be fed back in multiple ways using several neurophysiological methods (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], magnetoencephalography [MEG], functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], positron emission tomography [PET], and electroencephalogram [EEG]) [ , ]. These feedback techniques allow the participants to monitor, interact with, and manage their mental states [ ] and current states of cognition [ ] by rewarding desirable patterns of brain activity with visual, auditory [ ], or representational forms such as graphs, numbers, video games, and moving objects [ ]. \n\nPTSD symptoms derive from several areas of the brain. Abnormal contextual processing is often observed in patients with PTSD and it relies on the functional integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala [ ]. A previous meta-analysis found that the medial PFC, including the amygdala and hippocampus, was implicated in PTSD [ ]. Maild and colleagues (2009) showed that patients with PTSD had more amygdala activity and less activity in the PFC and hippocampus than healthy individuals [ ]. The PFC is important for the regulatory capacity [ ] and an increased amygdala activation was seen in all trauma-exposed individuals [ ]. Additionally, PTSD symptom reduction was associated with an increase in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation [ ]. Kohn et al. (2014) considered the dorsal ACC (dACC) as a core node for emotion regulation [ ]. In resting-state studies of PTSD, enhanced slow waves in the left temporal region and decreases in the right parietal cortex were reported [ ]. \n\nMany different NF protocols and methods exist [ ]. NF by both EEG and fMRI represents an emerging adjunctive treatment that allows participants to self-regulate their current neural states [ ]. fMRI-NFT is a novel method [ ] used to identify the associated brain structures [ ] and EEG-NFT is another way to obtain information on the functional neuroanatomy related to clinical symptoms [ ]. fMRI-NFT increases or decreases activity in specific cortical areas and has been used to modulate the neural correlates underlying psychopathology [ ]. fMRI-based NF training (fMRI-NFT) for PTSD has also been used to modulate amygdala activity [ ] and the ACC. In contrast, EEG-NFT is used to regulate more global neuro-signals, indicative of larger-scale brain oscillations [ ]. EEG-based NF training (EEG -NFT) for PTSD is mainly used to regulate the power of alpha waves alone or both alpha and theta waves [ ]. According to an EEG meta-analysis study, NF treatment and protocol characteristics were different in previous studies: some delivered daily treatment and others less frequent sessions, the duration of treatment varied, and the number of sessions and type of NF differed [ ]. However, a previous study [ ] reported that the clinical effect of NFT is still missing. Additionally, these two methods differ in NF, but the difference in their effectiveness is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of fMRI-NFT and EEG-NFT with PTSD participants compared to sham-NFT and no intervention. The primary outcomes were PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Search Strategy \n  \nThe studies were identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases conducted from January 2011 to December 2021. The search string was structured using the PICOS method: P (population) = the patients for PTSD, I (intervention) = neuro-feedback training, C (comparison) = sham, other cognitive training, control group, or no intervention, O (outcome) = PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and S (study design) = randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The search terms were trauma OR (PTSD OR post-traumatic stress disorder) AND (neurofeedback training OR NF-training OR NFT). \n\n\n### 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nWe combined the search results from five different databases and deleted duplicate records. Studies were included if they met the following criteria:   \nLanguage: English; \n  \nDesign: RCT; \n  \nIntervention: fMRI-NFT, EEG-NFT of alpha activity, e.g., alpha peak amplitude, alpha-theta ratio, or alpha and theta activities; \n  \nControl group: PTSD patients who received other treatments, sham-NFT, or no intervention; \n  \nParticipants: PTSD patients; \n  \nEvaluation: assessments of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. \n  \n\nStudies were ineligible if they were not written in English or were conference abstracts or were not full texts. \n\n\n### 2.3. Quality Evaluation \n  \nThe studies\u2019 quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool (Higgins and Green, 2011) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We determined the quality of each study according to the selection bias, allocation, detection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. Three levels (low, unclear, and high) of a risk of bias were evaluated. To determine if there was any bias in the individual results included in this study, publication bias was assessed by the visual inspection of funnel plots and by Egger\u2019s regression test (two-tailed   p  -values of <0.05 were considered to indicate the presence of the bias). \n\n\n### 2.4. Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis \n  \nData were extracted in duplicate using standardized data extraction forms. Information was gathered on the study\u2019s design, participants, NFT characteristics (type, modality, and sessions), and results. The outcomes were PTSD diagnosis, anxiety, and depression in PTSD participants. Studies were excluded if they met the following criteria:   \nNo control group design; \n  \nIntervention: cognitive tasks with no NFT, no EEG-NFT, or no fMRI-NFT; \n  \nControl group: healthy population; \n  \nEvaluation: data without assessment tools. \n  \n\nAll analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.0 software [ ]. We analyzed the total effect on PTSD symptoms (PTSD diagnosis, anxiety, and depression) using Hedges\u2019 g with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Hedges\u2019 g is the index of an effect adjusted for any intervention differences between experimental and control groups (Hedges\u2019 g < 0.3 indicates a small effect and g > 0.6 indicates a high degree of an effect size) [ ]. The I-squared statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity in each included study, with values of 25, 50, and 75% reflecting small, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively [ ]. I-squared > 50% and   p   < 0.05 indicated notable heterogeneity, and a random effect model was used [ ]. Second, EEG and fMRI studies were divided and their effect on PTSD was analyzed. Third, we used meta-regression to explore the effect of NFT sessions\u2019 length on the overall PTSD symptoms. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Search and Exclusion Results \n  \n shows the PRISMA flow chart for the study selection process. A total of 1174 records were identified from the initial database searches. After removing the duplicates, 40 records were screened in the first screening step. The eligibility criteria and a second screening step using PICOS identified 10 records. A total of seven records fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were finally included in this study. \n\n\n### 3.2. Description of Included Studies \n  \nA total of seven records met the criteria for qualitative synthesis ( ). Studies with an RCT were published from 2016 to 2021. There were two from PubMed, seven from the Web of Science, and three from the Cochrane library, of which a total of 9 were duplicated. Three of the included studies used fMRI-NFT and four used EEG-NFT. Overall, all studies included PTSD participants. The intervention protocols, with differences in NFT type, modality, and NFT-sessions are shown in  . The recorded brain regions and electrodes were the left amygdala (fMRI-NFT) and alpha activity (8\u201312 Hz) or the theta (4\u20137 Hz)-alpha (8\u201312 HZ) ratio (EEG-NFT). Of these studies, three studies used left-amygdala NFT, two studies used alpha NFT, and two studies used the theta-alpha ratio. The number of NFT-sessions ranged from 3 to 25 and the duration of the NFT-sessions was in the range of 6\u201340 min. PTSD symptoms including PTSD diagnoses were measured as the primary outcomes in all studies. The following tools were used: the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale(CAPS), PTSD Checklist-Military Version(PCL-M), PTSD Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Checklist-5th edition(PCL-5), the Davidson Trauma Scale(DTS), the Montgemery\u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory(BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HDRS), Beck Anxiety Inventory(BAI), Impact of the Event Scale-revised(IES-R), and Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities(IASC). This study was approved by the local research ethics committee and registered at the RROSPERO ID: CRD42022355878. \n\n\n### 3.3. Synthesis of Results \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Overall PTSD Symptoms \n  \n and   show the effect size of NFT using EEG and fMRI on PTSD symptoms in seven studies. The result showed a significant overall effect on PTSD symptoms (Hedges\u2019 g = \u22120.789, 95% CI: \u22121.004 to \u22120.392,   p   < 0.05) with a high heterogeneity (Q = 18.286,   p   = 0.006,   = 67.188). When divided into NFT types (EEG or fMRI), a significant result was obtained from EEG-NFT (four studies, Hedges\u2019 g = \u22121.132, 95% CI: \u22122.061 to \u22120.203,   p   < 0.05). In contrast, fMRI-NFT (three studies, Hedges\u2019 g = \u22120.368, 95% CI: \u22120.851 to 0.115,   p   < 0.05) showed low heterogeneity (Q = 0.156,   p   = 0.925,   = 0.000), but the effect size was not significant for PTSD symptoms.   shows the funnel plot of overall PTSD symptoms. One out of seven of the included studies was skewed from the mean to left. Publication bias was not found (  p   > 0.05).  \n\n\n#### 3.3.2. PTSD Diagnosis \n  \nOf these PTSD diagnosis assessments, CAPS, PCL-5, and DTS were from EEG-NFT and CAPS and PCL-M were from fMRI-NFT. The effect and heterogeneity tests showed that there was no heterogeneity (Q = 2.930,   p   = 0.711,   = 0.000), and the effectiveness of NFT on the PTSD diagnosis evaluation was significant (Hedges\u2019 g = \u22120.658, 95% CI: \u22120.983 to \u22120.333,   p   < 0.05) ( ).   shows a result of publication bias for PTSD diagnosis, but there was no bias (  p   > 0.05). \n\n\n#### 3.3.3. Anxiety and Depression \n  \nAnxiety assessments were made using MADRS and BDI. Depressions assessments were made by HAM-A, HDRS, and BAI. There was a high heterogeneity (Q = 12.587,   p   = 0.013,   = 68.221). The lower the dependent variable, the greater the effect size. The effect size was not significant for anxiety and depression (Hedges\u2019 g = \u22120.562, 95% CI: \u22121.230 to 0.106,   p   > 0.05) ( ). However, there was no publication bias for anxiety and depression (  p   > 0.05) ( ). \n\n\n#### 3.3.4. Meta-Regression by Dose Effects \n  \nAll of the studies included in this paper experimented with NFT for PTSD participants, and the length of the NFT sessions was different. Therefore, the sessions\u2019 length was broadly divided into short sessions and long sessions. There were three to seven sessions in the short-session group and 16 to 25 sessions in the long-session group.   shows a graph of the correlation analysis of the effectiveness of NFT according to the number of sessions. Although short-sessions tended to be more effective, the effect in the regression analysis was not significant (slope = \u22120.32581,   p   = 0.29661). \n\n\n\n### 3.4. Risk of Bias in the Results \n  \n shows a summary of the RoB assessment. All seven studies were at low levels for data completeness and result reporting, and at a low risk of bias. Most of the allocation and blinding of personnel and assessments showed an unclear or low risk. However, two studies showed a high risk of bias, one study for the blinding of personnel (the experiment was conducted even though the participants recognized that they were in the experiment group) and one study for the blinding assessments (staff knew which group the participants belonged to). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis study aimed to analyze whether NFT was effective in PTSD participants by dividing methods into EEG and fMRI as representative techniques, and whether there was a clinical improvement effect in a diagnosis evaluation and an anxiety and depression evaluation of PTSD symptoms. We found that EEG-NFT was more effective in improving PTSD symptoms than fMRI-NFT, and the effectiveness of NFT was significant in the scores seen in the PTSD diagnostic evaluations. \n\nA previous study [ ] reported that the clinical effect of NFT is still missing. There is no gold standard NFT protocol. The results of this study found that fMRI-NFT did not significantly affect clinical PTSD symptoms. Additionally, Nicholson et al. (2020) [ ] reported that there were differences in the neurobiological mechanisms of EEG and fMRI real-time NFT. fMRI-NFT showed high emotional responses in the PFC as the activity of the amygdala increased, so the connection between the PFC and the amygdala was the main brain region target, whereas in the case of EEG-NFT, PTSD symptoms were reduced by connectivity with the amygdala through the regions that treat processing and trauma memory and emotion regulation in the PFC. It is said that the process of processing information about fear and trauma has an indirect interaction with the amygdala. Therefore, it seems to have a positive effect on the PFC interaction with the amygdala. In addition, according to the last systematic review for EEG-NFT [ ], EEG helped to reduce stress levels by regulating alpha activity because it improved the working memory or the speed of visual information processing. Stress is a common symptom in patients with PTSD and EEG, which is effective in relieving stress, is also considered to be helpful in reducing PTSD symptoms. Additionally, in the recent EEG study for PTSD, the theta band of PTSD patients was significantly reduced [ ]. \n\nPTSD causes cognitive and emotional problems, including negative self-beliefs and expectations and an inability to experience positive emotions [ ]. There is a high level of comorbidity among PTSD participants, especially depression and anxiety [ ]. To evaluate PTSD symptoms, the effects of trauma and adverse life events are usually investigated using clinical interviews and self-reported instruments [ ]. In this study, a tool for diagnosing PTSD according to the cutline score calculated by measuring the level and sensitivity of the PTSD level, as well as anxiety and depression, were considered as psychological factors. As a result, PTSD diagnosis showed significant differences pre- and post-NFT, but not in psychological and physiological responses such as anxiety and depression. According to a study on PTSD [ ], Roemer, Orsillo, Borkovec, and Litz (1998) found that PTSD severity was not necessarily significantly related to fear or other negative emotions caused by trauma. Thus, stress from PTSD causes fear, anxiety, and depression, and these side reactions are not all related to predicting PTSD. PTSD is associated with PTSD symptoms, such as the sensitivity accepted by individuals, where they suffered trauma, what type of trauma they experienced, and how they responded to their emotions. The same study reported that an individual\u2019s emotional response should be measured in a different way than using self-reported measures to evaluate somebody\u2019s emotions. Of course, responses according to negative emotions can be part of PTSD symptoms, but it is not responses that are uniquely visible to every PTSD. \n\nStudies on NFT as a method of treating PTSD were analyzed. Twenty-four sessions of EEG-NFT led to significant improvements in PTSD symptoms and emotion regulation [ ]. Nicholson et al. (2020) [ ] evaluated patients over a long period and found that 61.1% of the participants in the NFT group no longer met the criteria for PTSD. This finding suggested that long-term PTSD treatment would be required. However, in this study\u2019s analysis, there was no effect on PTSD symptoms following short and long NFT sessions \n\nTaken together, in the current study, out finding showed that EEG-NFT was more likely to affect PTSD symptoms than fMRI, and NFT was found to be more effective in PTSD diagnosis than anxiety and depression. However, care should be taken with the interpretation of our results. Because of our small sample size, the results of the publication bias and the effect size are less reliable [ ]. \n\nSince the gold standard protocol for NFT used to treat PTSD symptoms remains unclear, future studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of different sessions, brain target-regions, and training protocol methods on PTSD symptoms. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nWe explored the effect of neuro-feedback training on PTSD symptoms. Our findings indicated that EEG-based neuro-feedback training was more helpful to train PTSD symptoms than fMRI-based neuro-feedback training. Moreover, this effect suggests that it is also valid for the evaluation of PTSD symptoms for clinical diagnoses. This meta-analysis study demonstrates the potential for affecting PTSD symptoms using EEG. Further research to establish a gold standard protocol for EEG-based neuro-feedback training for PTSD symptoms is needed. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9603735,"text_md5":"94f5980d3260b3c7ec9b55c1eef2b775","field_positions":{"authors":[0,30],"journal":[31,62],"publication_year":[64,68],"title":[79,171],"keywords":[185,263],"abstract":[276,1667],"body":[1676,20951]},"batch":1,"pmid":36293673,"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph192013096","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9603735","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9603735"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9603735\">9603735<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9603735  Efficacy of Neuro-Feedback Training for PTSD Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"}

We performed a whole-brain meta-analysis based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to elucidate the neurobiological basis underlying reward anticipation between CHR individuals and healthy controls. In our meta-analysis, we found that CHR individuals showed increased anticipation-related activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex as well as decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuit, including the putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, cerebellum, and supramarginal gyrus. These results provide further support for the aberrant salience hypothesis in at-risk populations, help us understand the neurobiology of the high risk of psychotic disorder, and could have implications for early identification and early intervention. \n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is a developmental disorder that begins with a prodromal period of altered functioning or symptomatology before the onset of threshold psychosis ( ). It has been recognized that the behavioral and neuropsychological manifestations in the early phases of SZ are different from those of late symptoms and chronic illness stage ( ), thus highlighting the importance of exploring the neural correlates of reward processing in the prodromal phase ( ). Moreover, the recruitment and evaluation of individuals at clinical high risk for SZ (CHR) could overcome confounding factors that are encountered when studying patients with SZ, such as antipsychotic medications and illness duration ( ). It is therefore important to investigate the psychopathological mechanisms among CHR individuals that could highlight early vulnerability factors. \n\n\u201cClinical high risk\u201d individuals have been defined as individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, or a recent decline in functioning ( ;  ). These prodromal syndromes can generally be assessed by several structured instruments [e.g., the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes ( ) and the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States ( )]. However, detecting psychosis risk solely based on the symptom characteristics of CHR individuals yields low efficiency. For example, relying on subtle symptoms in a CHR group led to a correct 24-month disease prediction in only 29% ( ). Fortunately, there are early neurobiological abnormalities apparent long before behavioral and subclinical symptoms emerge, such as abnormal laminar cortical organization, genetic alterations, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) abnormalities ( ;  ). A recent study used a support vector machine approach to analyze structural and fMRI data and effectively identified CHR individuals with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 76%, resulting in an accuracy of 72% ( ). Therefore, it is essential to examine potential neurobiological markers in CHR individuals that can shed light on early altered neural processes prior to significant psychopathologies, as found in patients with psychiatric disorders. \n\nImpaired anticipation of future rewards might play an important role in understanding psychotic symptoms in CHR individuals. Studies measuring monetarily incentivized responses have found that CHR individuals are more likely to attend to irrelevant stimulus features, which is interpreted as an aberrant motivational salience attribution ( ). It is hypothesized that chaotic firing of dopaminergic neurons projecting to limbic and cortical areas mediates the inadequate attribution of salience to irrelevant events, which in turn results in positive symptoms ( ). Wotruba and colleagues reported a significant correlation between positive symptoms and the anticipation signal in the ventral striatum (VS) and the insula in CHR individuals ( ). In addition, negative symptoms are thought to be associated with the transition to psychosis ( ). In a study that examined reward processing among the CHR population, individuals with greater negative symptoms showed greater BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( ). These studies provide some evidence that the CHR state may be associated with alterations in reward anticipation. Therefore, studying reward anticipation in the at-risk period may help us understand aberrant salience in CHR individuals. \n\nAlthough previous studies have identified several likely neural substrates for monetary anticipation in CHR individuals to date, the results are inconclusive. Several fMRI experiments have demonstrated abnormal brain activity in mesocorticolimbic circuitry during anticipation of reward-capturing \u201cmotivational salience\u201d in the CHR population ( ;  ). Alterations in motivational salience processing in the VS and cortical regions (such as the prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex) have been described in prepsychotic individuals ( ;  ). However, findings from these studies have been relatively mixed. Some studies have found that CHR individuals exhibit greater activations in the cingulate cortex ( ;  ), insula ( ), and superior frontal gyrus ( ). In contrast, other studies have reported that CHR individuals show deactivations in the posterior cingulate cortex and postcentral gyrus ( ) during anticipation. Such inconsistencies may be due to multiple factors, including the heterogeneity of the employed reward paradigm, the difference in clinical features, and the data processing strategy. \n\nConsequently, a recent meta-analysis attempted to address the question of the neural bases of reward signaling in SZ from the perspective of distinct stages of reward processing ( ). However, the sample of this meta-analysis included both CHR and SZ, resulting in unclear neurobiological mechanisms underlying CHR. In addition, this meta-analysis focused only on the VS instead of the whole brain. To map the potentially distinctive neural profiles associated with CHR and identify whether anticipation-related dysfunction predates the onset of SZ, it is necessary to investigate the biological mechanisms underpinning CHR during reward anticipation. \n\nTherefore, to address these doubts and inconsistencies and to improve current knowledge of reward impairments in CHR individuals, the current meta-analysis systematically synthesized the available evidence regarding whole-brain neural correlates of reward anticipation in CHR individuals and identified potential neuroimaging markers of SZ prodrome. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task ( ) and salience attribution test (SAT) ( ) are operant conditioning paradigms to study reward anticipation in which participants learn to respond to a discriminative stimulus by pushing a button, thereby creating a distinct state of reward anticipation ( ). We further examined the influence of demographic and clinical factors that contribute to reward-related brain responses with meta-regression analysis. Based on the literature reviewed above, we expected to find abnormal brain activation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in CHR individuals compared with healthy controls (HC) during anticipation. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Search Strategy \n  \nA comprehensive literature search of whole-brain fMRI studies comparing CHR individuals and HC was carried out in the PubMed ( ), Web of Science ( ), and ScienceDirect ( ) databases from January 1, 2000, to May 1, 2022. The search terms used were (1) \u201cschizophrenia\u201d OR \u201cschizophrenic\u201d OR \u201cschizoaffective\u201d OR \u201cSchizotypy\u201d OR \u201cpsychosis\u201d OR \u201cpsychotic\u201d; (2) \u201chigh risk\u201d OR \u201cultra-high risk\u201d OR \u201cat-risk mental state\u201d OR \u201cclinical risk\u201d OR \u201cbasic symptoms\u201d OR \u201cpsychotic-like experiences\u201d OR \u201cprodromal phase\u201d; (3) \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d; and (4) \u201cmonetary incentive delay task\u201d OR \u201cMID\u201d OR \u201cSalience Attribution Task\u201d OR \u201cSAT\u201d OR \u201creward anticipation.\u201d To increase the chances of identifying additional, relevant studies, the reference lists of the included articles and relevant review papers were manually searched. For studies without available coordinates at the whole-brain level, we asked the authors whether they could provide such information. If the authors did not respond, we excluded their studies if we could not obtain coordinate information and included their studies if we could not obtain some clinical data (e.g., psychiatric symptom scale score) but could obtain coordinate information. The flow diagram of the inclusion and exclusion process of the selected articles is described in  . \n  \nFlow diagram of the inclusion and exclusion process of selected articles. Of the 439 articles initially identified, a total of 13 studies were enrolled for the reward anticipation meta-analysis. CHR, clinical high risk for schizophrenia; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; HC, healthy controls; MID, monetary incentive delay; ROI, region of interest; SAT, salience attribution test.  \n  \nStudies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) included CHR individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, or a recent decline in functioning ( ;  ); (2) reported neuroimaging findings allowing a comparison of CHR and HC groups; (3) investigated fMRI brain responses during reward anticipation; and (4) reported significant results as 3D coordinates in either the Talairach or the Montreal Neurological Institute space based on a whole\u00adbrain analysis. \n\nThe exclusion criteria included the following: (1) publications were case reports, book chapters, reviews, or meta-analyses; (2) individuals were clinically diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; (3) absence of a control group; and (4) studies reported only region of interest findings. Four fMRI studies including unaffected relatives\/siblings of SZ patients were thus not included in our meta-analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). For 1 study where multiple independent CHR samples were compared with HC, the appropriate coordinates were included as separate datasets ( ). \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThe following data were recorded from each article: sample sizes, mean age, percentage of males, ethnicity, education level, income, collection site, severity of positive and negative symptoms, task performance (including the reaction time [RT], RT acceleration [mean RT differences between gain\/loss and neutral conditions], hit rate, and total amount gain), and several MRI methodological parameters (including the MRI field strengths, imaging data analysis software, and the statistical threshold). \n\nTo facilitate the comparison of different scales used in different studies, a common variable of positive\/negative symptoms was created. First, we extracted the mean and SD of the positive\/negative symptom dimension from the included articles as measured by the following rating scales: the Community Assessment of Psychic Experience, Chapman Social Anhedonia Scale, Revised Chapman Social Anhedonia Scale, Revised Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale, Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States interview, and Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes. For each measure of symptoms, we then rescaled each sample mean score according to the highest obtainable score on each particular instrument. For samples with more than 1 measure reported, the average value was calculated and recorded. \n\nThis meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines ( ). A 9-point checklist was used to evaluate study rigorousness via an objective description of the individual studies (  for the full criteria). The literature search, quality evaluation, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 investigators. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and, when necessary, by consulting a third member of the meta-analysis team. Kappa statistics showed a high agreement between reviewers for study selection (k\u2009=\u20090.78,   P  \u2009<\u2009.01). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and assessments of study quality are provided in the  . \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Relevant Studies \n  \nReward-related activation differences during reward anticipation between CHR individuals and HC were analyzed using seed-based d mapping (SDM) software (version 5.15,  ), which combined peak coordinates and statistical parametric maps, and used standard effect size and variance-based meta-analytic calculations. This method has been widely applied in previous meta-analyses of structural and fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ). In the SDM analysis, studies reporting no significant group differences can be included, and both positive and negative differences can be reconstructed in the same map. Therefore, it is an optimal method for comparing CHR individuals with HC without biasing the results ( ;  ). \n\nThe SDM methods and steps have been described in detail elsewhere ( ). First, peak coordinates and corresponding statistics of task-evoked brain activation differences between CHR individuals and HC were extracted from the included articles, and maps of statistics other than   t   values, such as   Z   scores and   P   values, were converted in advance into   t   values by online converters. Second, standard Montreal Neurological Institute maps of the differences in anticipation-related activation were created by means of a Gaussian kernel. Third, the mean map was calculated and weighted by the squared root of the sample size of each study. The default kernel size and statistical thresholds were as follows: full width at half maximum\u2009=\u200920 mm,   P  \u2009=\u2009.005, peak height threshold\u2009=\u20091, and extent threshold\u2009=\u200910 (Radua et al.,  ,  ). \n\nIn addition, to examine the effect of potential confounding variables and moderators on abnormal task-evoked activation as well as to assess the robustness of the findings, complementary analyses, including jackknife sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression analyses, were performed. We performed meta-regression analyses with a strict threshold of   P  \u2009<\u2009.0005 and considered only the brain regions identified in the main analysis of brain activation differences between the CHR and HC groups during reward anticipation (Radua et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nFourteen datasets from 13 whole-brain fMRI studies with 318 CHR individuals (mean age\u2009=\u200923.30 years; percentage of males\u2009=\u200955.00%) and 426 HC (mean age\u2009=\u200923.24 years; percentage of males\u2009=\u200959.00%) were included during the reward anticipation phase ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). No significant difference was found for age (  t  \u2009=\u20090.025,   P  \u2009=\u2009.659) or sex (\u03c7 \u2009=\u20091.626,   P  \u2009=\u2009.202) between the CHR and HC groups. The participant demographics and imaging characteristics of the included articles are provided in  . \n  \nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis \n    \n\n### Main Meta-Analysis \n  \nIn the pooled meta-analysis of reward anticipation, relative to the HC, the CHR individuals exhibited higher activations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lower activations in the left cerebellum (extending to the parahippocampal gyrus), right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and right insula (extending to the putamen) in response to monetary stimuli ( ;  ). \n  \nResults of the Anticipation Meta-Analysis for Brain Activation Difference Between CHR Individuals and HC \n      \nTask-evoked activation differences during reward anticipation between clinical high risk for schizophrenia (CHR) individuals and healthy controls (HC) in the meta-analysis. Brain regions that showed significant differences in anticipation-evoked activity in CHR individuals relative to HC. Red indicates regions that showed hyperactivity in CHR individuals relative to HC, and blue indicates regions that showed hypoactivity in patients relative to HC. The color scale represents probability values from statistical permutation testing (  Z   values). For the main analysis of the anticipation stage, CHR individuals showed increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) but decreased activations in the left cerebellum (extending to the parahippocampal gyrus), right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and right insula (extending to the putamen).  \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n  \nThe mean score for quality assessment was 8.5 out of 9 points (range = 8\u20139 points), as shown in supplementary  . In the whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis, the decreased activation in the left cerebellum was preserved in all included datasets. The hyperactivations in the mPFC and ACC remained significant in 13 datasets and failed to emerge in 1 dataset ( ). The hypoactivity in the right SMG and right insula remained significant in 13 datasets and failed to emerge in 1 dataset ( ) ( ). \n  \nSubgroup and Jackknife Sensitivity Analyses in Brain Activation Difference Between CHR Individuals and HC During Reward Anticipation Stage \n    \n\n### Heterogeneity and Bias Analyses \n  \nAs shown in  , there was no significant between-study heterogeneity in any of the peak coordinates. Additionally, Egger\u2019s test showed no \u201csmall study\u201d bias (  P\u2009  >\u2009.05) for any of the clusters reported as significant ( ). See   for detailed results. \n\n\n### Subgroup Analyses \n  \nTo control for any possible differences observed between studies, the subgroup analyses were repeated to include only those studies that were methodologically homogenous. Therefore, we conducted subgroup analyses for those datasets including only adult CHR individuals, for those including CHR individuals without comorbidities, for those using the MID paradigm, and for those using a 3-T MRI scanner. The main results of the meta-analysis remained largely unchanged when the analyses were repeated in all subgroup analyses, except for the adult subgroup analysis. For the adult subgroup analysis, the hyperactivation in the mPFC and ACC in the pooled main analysis did not remain significant. The hypoactivation in the left cerebellum, right SMG, and right insula in the adult subgroup analysis was consistent with that in the pooled main analysis. The detailed results are shown in  . \n\n\n### Meta-Regression Analyses \n  \nMeta-regression analysis revealed that the mean age, percentage of males, positive and negative symptom severity, RT, RT acceleration, and hit rate were not linearly associated with task-related activation during reward anticipation. The effect of other variables, including ethnicity, education level, income, and total amount gain on brain activation, could not be explored due to insufficient data. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn the current whole-brain meta-analysis of brain activation from published reward-related fMRI studies, we examined the neural basis of monetary anticipation in CHR individuals. Our whole-brain meta-analysis provided evidence that CHR individuals showed increased anticipation-related activations in the mPFC and ACC cortical regions but decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuit, including the right putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus, left cerebellum, right SMG, and right insula. These findings in the CHR group confirmed brain reward-related activation during reward anticipation while performing the reward task, which might indicate a broader vulnerability to motivational-related symptoms in persons at risk for psychosis. \n\nIn the present study, we observed hyperactivity in response to monetary reward in the mPFC and ACC during reward anticipation in CHR individuals. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have also identified exaggerated prefrontal activity during reward processing in populations at high familial risk for psychosis ( ;  ;  ;  ), ultra-high risk populations ( ;  ), and healthy people with SZ risk\u2013associated genes ( ). In particular, the PFC dysfunction found in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis is associated with an increased risk for transition to psychosis ( ). The frontal lobe regions, including the mPFC and ACC, have been reported to play a role in learning reward associations, selecting reward goals, choosing actions to obtain reward, and monitoring the potential value of switching to alternative courses of action ( ). In detail, the ACC is important for value integration to guide effort-based decisions in humans and reflect both anticipated effort and anticipated reward ( ;  ). The frontal medial regions of the prefrontal cortex, having reciprocal connectivity with several neuromodulatory systems, are key components of neural circuits involved in detecting the motivational significance of external stimuli ( ). These results support the \u201caberrant salience\u201d notion that psychotic symptoms may arise from inappropriately attributing salience to irrelevant stimuli. The increased responses of the mPFC\/ACC in CHR individuals may be due to oversensitivity to the salience of external stimuli and reward monitoring ( ). Another possible explanation is that the prefrontal cortex exerts top-down control over the interaction between midbrain dopaminergic systems and the striatum, and increased activity in the PFC may inhibit reward-related behavior ( ). The hyperactivation in these regions was considered to be a compensatory mechanism for structural and functional deficits of the mesolimbic system ( ;  ). Thus, our findings of greater responses in the mPFC and cingulate cortex may suggest increased reward expectation, salience processing, and cognitive responses to the task or could be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the changes in the mesolimbic regions. \n\nIn contrast, we found that CHR individuals exhibited decreased activation in the mesolimbic system, including the putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, SMG, and cerebellum, during reward anticipation. A considerable number of fMRI studies have revealed a correlation between activity in the ventral and dorsal striatum and reward prediction error in regard to both primary rewards ( ) and monetary rewards ( ). Individuals with CHR also exhibited reduced striatal activity during reward anticipation compared with controls, which has been widely reported in previous studies ( ). Volumes in the putamen, whose output is modulated by dopaminergic inputs, are known to be abnormal in SZ ( ;  ) and in individuals at high risk for psychosis ( ;  ). Given the key role of dorsal striatal regions in anticipatory or motivational components of reward-seeking behavior, the smaller volume and reduced activity in the putamen may be a neural substrate for anticipatory anhedonia and an indication of an earlier high-risk stage ( ). The insula is widely connected to many areas of the cortex and limbic system involved in reward and decision-making, such as the frontal pole, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ACC, and striatum ( ). Human and animal studies have implicated the insula in the assessment of stimuli and the allocation of appropriate arousal for motor preparation and selective attention, 2 processes that play key roles in the MID task ( ). These processes may be inhibited in CHR individuals, thus leading to decreased activation in the insula during the anticipation of reward ( ). Additionally, the hippocampal-parahippocampal region showed both reduced activity and reduced coupling during declarative memory with fMRI in high-risk populations, thus reflecting abnormal memory function in at-risk individuals ( ). The current findings highlight mesolimbic circuit dysfunction in the pursuit of reward, which contributes to motivational impairment in the risk state of psychosis. \n\nOur meta-analysis also revealed that blunted brain activation was found in the cerebellum in CHR individuals compared with HC. By sending direct excitatory projections to the ventral tegmental area, the cerebellum can modulate brain-wide reward circuitry ( ). Recent evidence has indicated that granule cells in the cerebellum encode salient predictive information about the future and signal reward expectations ( ). An accumulating body of work has also highlighted cerebellar dysfunction in psychosis-risk individuals (Bernard et al.,  ,  ). Abnormal cerebellar activation in CHR may imply difficulties in learning and achieving automaticity in task execution. Therefore, our finding of reduced cerebellar activation could be a neural substrate for reward anticipation-related deficits in CHR individuals. \n\nThe findings of decreased activation in the right SMG in the CHR group with respect to the controls have previously been reported in reward anticipation ( ). Anatomically, the SMG is one of the largest areas of the inferior parietal lobule, a key region that receives and recognizes visual information activated by visual cortices ( ). SMG abnormalities may reflect deficits in recognizing reward expected visual cues among CHR individuals. Similarly, an fMRI study on CHR individuals also reported decreased activation of the SMG during the N-Back task ( ). Compared with the prefrontal cortex or cingulate, the SMG appears to be relatively overlooked, although it has been widely considered a crucial component of the impaired frontal\u2013limbic\u2013temporal\u2013parietal network involved in the SZ development process ( ). Here, we provided evidence for this finding by showing decreased SMG activity in CHR individuals compared with that in controls. \n\nNotably, the subgroup analyses showed that the increased brain activity in the mPFC\/ACC did not survive in the adult CHR subgroup analyses. The critical role of the mPFC and ACC in reward prediction, reinforcement learning, and prompting effortful behavior has been widely documented ( ). In line with previous studies, we found that hyperactivity in these regions appeared to be more pronounced in younger participants ( ;  ). Uniquely adolescent characteristics such as risk-taking behavior and impulsivity are typical of this age and might substantially contribute to both psychological and neurobiological vulnerability in those groups ( ;  ). Some evidence supported that adolescent risk-taking behavior might be driven by disproportionately increased activation of the motivational circuit by potential gain cues relative to the influence of inhibitory circuits ( ;  ). Together, our subgroup results suggested that adolescents exhibited more recruitment of the mPFC\/ACC region while anticipating responses for gains than adults. Future studies could conduct longitudinal research on the at-risk individuals or directly compare adult CHR individuals with young CHR individuals to better observe the potential effect of neurodevelopmental mechanisms associated with reward processing. \n\nConsidering the significance of brain-behavior association, it is important to investigate relationships between brain measures and behavioral performance. However, in our current study, correlations between task performance (RT, RT acceleration, and hit rate) and monetary-induced activities were not significant. Many previous studies and reviews have disentangled the relationships between MID variables and symptom deficits, and there is tentative but mixed evidence for the association. At the behavioral level, the HC group appeared to win a higher cumulative total of money ( ) and show a faster response to reward ( ) or a higher hit rate ( ) compared with high-risk individuals. Moreover, most studies have suggested an association between monetary reward deficits and psychotic symptoms ( ;  ) such that poor MID is associated with more pronounced psychotic symptoms. However, several studies have also reported that RT ( ), monetary win ( ), and hit rate ( ) did not differ in high-risk individuals. At the neural level, 1 study revealed that insular activation was negatively correlated with RT acceleration (as indexed by the mean RT difference between neutral and salience conditions) during the presentation of salient stimuli compared with that during the presentation of neutral stimuli ( ). This may imply that insular activation in CHR individuals was associated with impaired discrimination of salience and could be linked to aberrant motivational salience processing in CHR individuals. Another study found that the risk population showed increased ACC activity with a gain in reaction speed but at the expense of correctness during a choice reaction task ( ). Considering the function of the PFC\/ACC in mediating the cognitive control of response selection ( ), enhanced neural activation may reflect more focus on, more effort required for, or improved efficiency in modulating, coordinating, and integrating goal-relevant information within the task demand. The null results in the current meta-regression analysis can be attributed to multiple sources, such as clinical features, cue features of the employed paradigm, and data processing strategy. Clearly, whether incentive salience\u2013induced brain activity directly correlates with actual behavioral responses will be an important question for future study. \n\nFocusing on common and distinct dysfunctional patterns of brain activation between CHR groups and SZ groups is of great significance to delineate neurobiological characteristics in different stages of psychosis. Although we did not make a direct comparison of SZ and CHR individuals in the current meta-analysis, compared with the results of recent meta-analyses focusing on SZ, we found that SZ and CHR individuals showed similar brain hypoactivation patterns in the mesolimbic circuit but different activation profiles in the PFC\/ACC during reward anticipation ( ;  ). Importantly, SZ exhibited reduced anticipation-related activity in both ventral and dorsal striatal regions ( ), whereas the CHR group showed reduced activation only in the DS region. Hypoactivation in the dorsal and VS during the anticipation of monetary incentives was also observed in first-episode SZ patients ( ;  ;  ;  ), chronic SZ patients (Juckel, et al.,  ,  ), and their unaffected first-degree relatives ( ;  ). Our finding of only DS hypoactivation in CHR individuals is in contrast to findings of decreased activation in the VS in patients ( ) and siblings of patients ( ) but is in line with the findings of 1 study in people with subclinical psychotic experiences ( ). DS dysfunction in the CHR group may suggest impairment in the construction of associations between monetary rewards and cues, thereby impeding salience attribution ( ). Contrary to the finding of decreased activations in the PFC\/ACC in SZ patients ( ;  ), CHR individuals exhibited increased mPFC\/ACC activation in our meta-analysis. This is consistent with results from a previous study that the high-risk sample exhibited enhanced activation in the superior frontal gyrus and the cingulate cortex ( ). These results may provide evidence that PFC\/ACC activity could be disturbed before the transition to psychosis, and this pattern is different from that of SZ patients. However, shared and unique functional brain activity patterns between psychotic patients and high-risk individuals need to be clarified in future studies. \n\nExploring the pathophysiology in at-risk individuals prior to psychosis onset is potentially important for early diagnosis and intervention. SZ is now considered to be a brain disorder and developmental disorder rather than only a psychological conflict or stable disease ( ). The onset of mental illness generally occurs early, but its diagnosis is delayed ( ). One of the possible interpretations of this phenomenon is that clinical and neurobiological profiles in the early phases are unlike those in the later phases ( ). In our current meta-analysis, our findings of distinct patterns of enhanced responses in the mPFC and ACC and lower reactivity in the mesolimbic circuit in CHR individuals may represent a putative biomarker in individuals at high risk for psychosis. These patterns may contribute to our understanding of abnormalities in the CHR population, thus offering great potential to identify reliable biomarkers of psychosis prodrome and diagnostic criteria for presyndromal SZ. Furthermore, by studying individuals with a risk of developing this pathology, CHR research will help guide the development of an evidence-based early intervention for reducing symptoms or preventing the transition to psychosis. Such research may also help to improve the prediction of subsequent psychosis. However, translating these findings into clinical practice is a challenge, and further research is needed to produce clinically validated biomarkers and proven therapeutic strategies for psychotic disorders. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations should be considered when assessing the impact of these findings. First, instead of focusing on cross-sectional studies, longitudinally following individuals to identify functional alterations would have been ideal. A longitudinal study could be performed to determine whether the altered trajectories of brain activation during reward tasks precede psychosis onset and predict the transition to psychosis in a high-risk group. Second, the correlations between reward-related activation and task performance variable (including total amount gain) could not be investigated because of insufficient data. Third, this meta-analysis is unable to indicate whether the reported monetary response is reflective of psychosis-specific risk or general vulnerability for psychopathology because all the included studies relied on healthy volunteers as a reference point and there were too few studies that recorded help-seeking information for controls. Future research will be needed to recruit help-seeking controls to elucidate psychosis-specific vulnerability mechanisms. Fourth, we included only studies that used monetary stimuli to elicit brain responses. Because clinical and CHR individuals have extensive cognitive impairment, it is not clear whether other forms of reinforcing stimuli (e.g., social and emotional stimuli) would lead to the same results. Furthermore, some reward paradigms, such as the MID task, are relatively simple, so it is difficult to identify the reinforcement learning deficits of individuals. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn summary, we demonstrated that CHR individuals showed increased activations in the prefrontal regions involving the mPFC and ACC and decreased activation in the mesolimbic circuitry during reward anticipation. Our results further support the notion that the CHR state is associated with abnormalities in reward-related brain function, thus enhancing the understanding of the pathophysiological characteristics in the CHR stage. \n\n\n## Supplementary Materials \n  \nSupplementary data are available at   International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology (IJNPPY)   online. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10109154,"text_md5":"e3c0df361aeb27e1e6e76f550933cd0a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,112],"journal":[113,139],"publication_year":[141,145],"title":[156,265],"keywords":[279,351],"abstract":[364,2010],"body":[2019,37257]},"batch":1,"pmid":36893068,"doi":"10.1093\/ijnp\/pyad009","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10109154","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10109154"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10109154\">10109154<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10109154  A Meta-Analysis of Neural Correlates of Reward Anticipation in Individuals at Clinical Risk for Schizophrenia"}

We undertook systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies in which healthy new mothers were exposed to visual stimuli of own versus other infants to determine the quality of evidence for a dedicated maternal neural network. Systematic literature review revealed a pattern of specific neural responses commonly induced by visual infant paradigms. Brain areas consistently reported as activated in mothers in response to own versus unknown infant included the left thalamus, bilateral pre-central gyrus, left limbic lobe, uncus, amygdala and left caudate. These regions are implicated in reward, attention, emotion processing and other core social cognitive skills. Meta-analysis, however, revealed a more limited subset of brain areas activated in mothers specifically in response to their own versus unknown infant and suggested considerable inter-study variability. Further work is needed if functional imaging is to become an objective tool for the assessment of neural pathways associated with distinct patterns of maternal care behaviour. Such a tool would be invaluable in developing biomarkers of neural activity associated with healthy maternal care and for monitoring treatment\/intervention effects of costly parenting interventions. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007\/s00737-018-0878-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of seven new mothers listening to sounds of infants crying nearly two decades ago (Lorberbaum et al.  ), this powerful technique has been increasingly employed in an attempt to identify a specific brain circuitry for maternal care behaviour (Swain et al.  ). Using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect, fMRI can indicate which brain areas are being used in response to different conditions\u2014this works on the principle that areas which are more active in response to a particular stimuli will require greater perfusion to meet the demand for oxygen. Squire and Stein ( ) argued that use of fMRI (with a spatial resolution ~\u20093\u20134\u00a0mm; Glover  ) could strengthen our understanding of maternal care behaviour in order to provide much needed insights into its neural basis. \n\n\u2018Maternal sensitivity\u2019 as a construct that involves ability for perception, accurate interpretation and appropriate responsiveness to infant\u2019s signal (Ainsworth et al.  ) is believed to foster secure attachment and promote child\u2019s development. Literature has suggested that variation in maternal sensitivity (i.e. sensitive and less sensitive mothers) is an outcome of interaction between behavioural, social factors that charts a discrete profile of the maternal brain that is mediated by stress- and reward-related neural systems. \n\nIn imaging terms, \u2018maternal responsiveness\u2019 refers to neural brain activation patterns associated with a mother\u2019s response to own infant stimuli. Within clinical settings, observations of maternal-infant interactions by professionals provide useful \u2018snapshots\u2019 that may be helpful in highlighting specific issues requiring extra support. However, due to their very nature, these judgements are quite informal and subjective. There are standardised and validated observer-rated scales of maternal or caregiver interaction available (e.g. CARE-index, Crittenden  ). Such scales, however, are time-consuming and costly requiring trained raters and so are only used in research settings. fMRI offers the opportunity to develop newer more accurate observer-rated scales of maternal interaction that can be used in clinical settings or to evaluate innovative parenting interventions. \n\nIt is likely that a number of different pathways or mechanisms could result in a mother exhibiting suboptimal maternal care. Studies that focus on the neurobiological correlates of maternal sensitivity in a distinct group of mothers representing natural variations in maternal sensitivity were few, including one of our own (Elmadih et al.  ). Preliminary evidence from these studies showed that maternal sensitivity appears to be accompanied by a discrete neural correlate and that modulation of maternal brain responses by oxytocin (OT) is possible (i.e. as evidenced by the significant correlation between plasma OT and BOLD activation). Yet, further studies are needed before fMRI could be used as a biomarker for maternal sensitivity. Other analysis parameters, such as connectivity, are being explored to see if more subtle changes are present. In the future, such parameters could be used in conjunction with reported and observational measures to help identify mothers at risk of suboptimal responsiveness at an earlier stage and help to evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to enhance sensitive parental caregiving. \n\nPrevious fMRI studies have used either auditory (infant cries) or visual (images\/videos of infants) stimuli to compare maternal brain responses to infant versus non-infant control stimuli; or to own versus unknown infant control stimuli. Such studies have used a range of sample sizes from small to large numbers of participants (  N  \u2009=\u20094\u201330). \n\nStudies reveal a diverse pattern of responses to infant stimuli, including activation in dopamine-associated reward processing areas, cortico-limbic modules, emotional processing pathways and the mirror neuron system. Swain ( ) proposed a model for the brain circuitry underlying parental responsiveness involving subcortical and cortical regions (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This model has been updated (Swain et al.  ) with a breakdown of activate areas commonly reported by parental imaging studies in response to infant stimuli.   \nSwain\u2019s model for the brain basis of parental responsiveness. Source: Swain ( ); used with the permission of the author \n  \n\nFollowing salience appraisal involving sensory, autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways which activate the sensory cortex, three potential responses were identified:   \n\u2018Reflexive caring\u2019, located in the subcortical brain, including the hypothalamus, medial preoptic area, lateral septum, amygdala and thalamocingulate regions; \n  \n\u2018Empathic and related cognitive emotional responses associated with mentalization\u2019, including mirror neuron systems in the frontal, insular and superior temporoparietal cortices, cingulate and regions associated with memory such as the hippocampus; \n  \n\u2018Drives and habits related to emotions, alarm and preoccupations\u2019, including the ventral tegmental area, striatum, amygdala, insula, cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex. \n  \n\nThis model is based on a review of neuroimaging studies to date. Our meta-analysis seeks to refine this parental brain model using quantitative techniques. Given the diversity of findings, spatial meta-analysis (Turkeltaub et al.  ) may be the most appropriate way more robustly to establish whether (and which) specific brain areas are most likely to represent a dedicated neural network for maternal responsiveness. Lieberman and Cunningham ( ) recommended greater focus on drawing conclusions from meta-analysis rather than from a single fMRI study. This has the potential to provide more reliable results by reducing type I errors (i.e. false positives) and, where appropriate, allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid type II errors (i.e. missing true effects). \n\nThe primary aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether there is indeed evidence for a dedicated maternal neural network associated with brain responses to visual cues from own versus control infants (up to the age of 2\u00a0years). First, we undertook a systematic review to summarise reported maternal brain activation. Second, we examined quantitatively evidence for distinct activation patterns in maternal responding to own infant, focusing on studies using visual stimuli. Auditory stimuli used in studies of maternal response typically comprise emotionally laden baby laughter or cry sounds. By contrast, studies using visual stimuli include neutral as well as emotional faces, allowing responses to infants per se to be disambiguated from responses specifically to infants expressing emotion. It is important to note that whilst visual and auditory cues are most commonly used within fMRI imaging studies due to the constraints of the technique, in a naturalistic setting, other infant stimuli such as tactile and olfactory are likely to influence maternal brain responsiveness. \n\nWe hypothesised that (1) maternal brain responsiveness to infant versus control stimuli in healthy new mothers is associated with a distributed neural network; (2) this network is consistent with current models of maternal neural responses (Swain et al.  ); (3) differences in activation to own versus control infant will be particularly significant for neural regions associated with hedonic responses (reward from the experience of maternal love) and emotional salience. More specifically, we predict that there will be differences in activation in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and septal regions, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula and basal ganglia (in relation to the hedonic response and emotional salience of infant stimuli). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic review: inclusion criteria for studies \n  \nOnly original fMRI studies were included, in which healthy mothers were exposed to visual stimuli of own as well as control infants (up to 24\u00a0months in age), and a comparison of maternal brain activation in response to these stimuli was undertaken. To reduce bias in spatial meta-analyses, it is important that only data from independent studies is included. Therefore, study data were excluded if it contributed to another study, in which case the study with the largest group size was included. Studies including infants older than 24\u00a0months were eliminated to avoid excess heterogeneity between infant stimuli that may minimise the areas of brain activation identified through meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Identification of studies \n  \nPapers were identified by typing the word combination [\u2018parent\u2019 or \u2018mother\u2019 or \u2018maternal\u2019] and [\u2018fMRI\u2019 or \u2018imaging\u2019] into the search engines \u2018PubMed\u2019, \u2018Web of Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Google Scholar\u2019. The words \u2018fMRI\u2019\/\u2019imaging\u2019 and \u2018parent\u2019\/\u2018mother\u2019\/\u2018maternal\u2019 had to appear in the title or abstract in order for the papers to be identified. Works that incorporated one of these words, such as \u2018mother  ing  ,\u2019 were also valid. Relevant research and review papers were searched for mention of additional studies. Researchers identified as leading the field were contacted to enquire whether they had carried out additional research. The methodology was in line with the principles of systematic reviews as outlined by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (2011). \n\n\n### Method of meta-analysis \n  \nEstimates of association were meta-analysed using the software GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ), which is suitable for studies with comparable experimental paradigms even if the number of studies is small. Studies using photographs or videos of infants were combined in the analysis. Confirmation was obtained from studies\u2019 authors that data did not overlap between studies to ensure data points were not included more than once. All reported findings satisfy criteria of   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.001 for fixed effects (whole brain uncorrected) or   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 FWE corrected\/  p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.001 whole brain uncorrected for random effects analysis. The field strength of the scanners used in each included study was also recorded (see supplementary Tables\u00a0 \u2013 ). Potentially, studies using lower field strength scanners may impact the spatial resolution but not localisation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Identified studies \n  \nTwelve identified studies were published between November 2002 and January 2016. Results from an additional unpublished study (Abel et al.  ) were obtained directly from the researchers. Strathearn et al. ( ) was reported to be an earlier version of the authors\u2019 later papers (Strathearn et al.  ,  ), and was hence excluded from reported summaries and further analyses leaving. Of the 12 studies remaining, 7 used static images (i.e. photographs) and 5 used moving images (i.e. videos). \n\nSupplementary Table   (S1) provides a chronological summary of all identified studies (both static images and videos), the stimuli used, their research design, and the contrasts they provided \n\n\n### Summary of identified brain activity \n  \nAn overview of areas reported as significantly activated in identified studies of mothers exposed to visual stimuli of own versus control infant stimuli is given in supplementary Tables\u00a0  and   (S2 and S3). The diversity of reported results suggests that a broad range of brain areas are associated with a mother responding to visual stimuli of her own infant. Within the current literature, there is a wide range of findings from studies with relatively small sample sizes. Meta-analysis was therefore performed and related to existing literature. \n\n\n### Studies included in the meta-analysis \n  \nTable   shows a summary of included and excluded studies, how many participants took part in each study, and how many relevant foci were provided by each study. Of the 12 identified studies, 9 (Nitschke et al.  ; Ranote et al.  ; Noriuchi et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ; Atzil et al.  ; Barrett et al.  ; Wan et al.  ; Abel et al.  ) provided foci for maternal brain activation in response to images of own versus control children (familiar or unknown). Two studies (Swain et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ) were excluded as it was not possible to obtain the relevant foci for them\u2014they were not reported in the papers and the authors were unable to provide them upon request.   \nIncluded and excluded studies \n  \n\nOne study (Atzil et al.  ) reported foci for both intrusive and synchronous mothers; however, for the purpose of the analyses, foci for the combined results were used (i.e., including all mothers). In this study, synchronous mothers were those whose behaviour was appropriate and relevant to the infant signals whilst intrusive mothers demonstrated excessive maternal behaviour not in keeping with the infants\u2019 signals. Another study (Strathearn et al.  ) reported foci for activation in response to happy, sad and neutral infant faces, while Barrett et al. ( ) reported foci using happy and sad infant faces; for the purpose of the analysis, the combined results (i.e. responses to all faces) were used. One study applied small volume correction to their initial results (Noriuchi et al.  )\u2014it was not possible to obtain the coordinates for activation prior to small volume correction and so this study was excluded in order to prevent spatial bias. The nine included studies provided 136 foci overall, with 147 subjects included. Eight studies provided coordinates in Talairach space, while one study (Abel et al.  ) reported coordinates in MNI space. These were converted into Talairach space using GingerALE. \n\nProbability maps were generated uncorrected at   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001. This strict   p   value was chosen in lieu of correction for multiple comparisons and in absence of cluster level stats. This approach is recommended in the GingerALE manual. Once the analysis had been run in GingerALE, \u2018Mango\u2019 software (v 3.8; Designed and developed by Jack L. Lancaster, Ph.D. and Michael J. Martinez) was used to produce images of activated brain areas. \n\n\n### Results of meta-analysis \n  \nTable   shows results for meta-analysis of nine studies (total sample\u2009=\u2009147 participants), uncorrected (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) level of significance. Based on the combined results of these studies, maternal exposure to visual stimuli of own versus control children was associated with activation (uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) of the following brain areas: left thalamic ventral lateral nucleus, bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 4), left uncus (BA 34) and amygdala in the limbic lobe and left caudate body (Fig\u00a0 ).   \nSummary of maternal brain activity as identified by meta-analyses in response to visual stimuli of own and control infant (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) (  n  \u2009=\u2009147) \n  \n ACT   activated \n    \nBrain activation in mothers exposed to visual stimuli for own versus control infant. Activation was found within the thalamus, post-central gyri, caudate and parahippocampus.   P  \u2009=\u20090.0001, uncorrected \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time formal meta-analysis methodologies have been used to integrate evidence for a distributed maternal brain circuitry. The main finding was that significant activation occurred in far fewer areas than suggested by conventional systematic literature review. Meta-analysis identified increased activation in response to own versus unknown infant visual stimuli in left thalamic ventral lateral nucleus; bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 4), left uncus (BA 34) and amygdala in the limbic lobe, and left caudate body. \n\nOur findings differ from models previously proposed by Swain ( ), Swain et al. ( ) primarily because we highlight fewer areas robustly activated by visual contrasts of own versus unknown infants. \n\nAlthough the diversity of brain areas robustly activated in response to infant visual stimuli concords with the complexity of maternal behaviour, it is also likely to reflect differences in the stimuli and fMRI paradigm across studies, as well as the variety of neural responses which depend on the particular \u2018affective cognitive\u2019 style of individual mothers. The interface between affective and cognitive processing, termed \u2018affective cognition\u2019, includes the ability to attend to, recognise and interpret different emotional stimuli (e.g. emotive sounds, words, facial expressions, body language), as well as how such information is categorised, encoded and subsequently recalled from memory to guide current behaviour (Elliott et al.  ). Thus, a mothers\u2019 individual affective cognitive style is likely to be another factor influencing the neural responses identified by fMRI. We consider, therefore, evidence from fMRI studies of affect, emotion and cognitive processing that should (in relation to the each of the brain areas) be activated robustly following meta-analysis. \n\n### Thalamus \n  \nWe identified thalamic activation in response to own versus control infants; this is consistent with previous studies in mothers who reported an increase of positive emotional experience when seeing their own infants (Swain et al.  ). The thalamus is high in dopaminergic projections (S\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.  ) and activation within this area has been associated with motivational salience of infant stimuli (Swain et al.  ). \n\nThalamic activation is found in neural responses to own versus other infants in both visual and infant cry paradigms (Swain et al.  ); and it is activated differently by infant compared to adult, or animal faces of any age (Caria et al.  ). In the Swain et al. models ( ) (Swain  ), the thalamus is considered important for reflexive caring. However, thalamic activation may also be part of a thalamic-cortical-basal ganglia loop associated with repetitive or reflex behaviours (Baxter  ; Leckman et al.  ). \n\n\n### Precentral gyrus \n  \nOur analysis revealed bilateral activation in precentral gyrus. Human maternal care is a very tactile and active process which involves the coordination of many motor outputs; lifting, cuddling, cradling, rocking, feeding etc. Activity in this area may, therefore, be associated with planning behavioural outputs, provoked in a mother when she views images of her infant and associated with her intent or desire to respond to her child needs (Swain et al.  ). Alternatively, this activity may be related to the \u2018readiness-to-act\u2019, perhaps associated with hypervigilance that comes with appropriate maternal sensitivity. \n\n\n### Limbic lobe \n  \nLeft limbic lobe activation, comprising activation in uncus (BA 34) and amygdala occurred in mothers looking at own versus other infants. The uncus is the most anterior and medial portion of the parahippocampal gyrus, located directly above the amygdala (Tamraz et al.  ). The attribution of emotional salience to stimuli engages these areas along with insula, amygdala and basal ganglia (Phan et al.  ). \n\nThe parahippocampal lobe plays an important role in encoding emotional memory and retrieval (Ferreira et al.  ). The ability to call on previous experience is an essential aspect of maternal caregiving, especially in new mothers who are learning new skills constantly. Processing and regulation of emotional information, alongside memory retrieval, is likely to be a key aspect in appropriate maternal behaviour. In Swain et al.\u2019s   model, several other areas including the insula, cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex were included under the \u2018drives and habits\u2019 response. Survival of the limbic lobe\u2019s focus of activation through meta-analysis shows that it is consistently activated by maternal imaging paradigms. The absence of foci of activation within other limbic areas such as the insula and cingulate cortices may reflect the diversity of paradigms in studies of maternal responses to infant stimuli. For example, in Swain et al.\u2019s   review, children aged up to 6\u00a0years, fathers and non-visual stimuli have been included. \n\n\n### Caudate \n  \nOur analysis revealed a focus of activation within the left caudate nucleus, one of the structures of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are part of a reward network that includes septal regions and left orbitofrontal cortex (Bechara et al.  ; Peters and B\u00fcchel\u00a0 ). Basal ganglia activation has also been associated with obsessional behaviours (Hars\u00e1nyi et al.  ). It has been suggested that activation of these areas implies that a mother\u2019s feelings towards her new infant are akin to obsessional or addictive behaviour in terms of their reward response (Burkett and Young  ). This notion is supported by mothers\u2019 descriptions of the powerful emotions they experience on exposure to their new infant (e.g., Leckman et al.  ; Swain et al.  ). The dopaminergic reward system in the midbrain is crucial for the motivation of caregiving in new mothers (Numan and Numan  ; Strathearn  ). Activation of basal ganglia in response to own versus control children mirrors findings of similar responses to romantic partners (Bartels and Zeki  ), which the authors associated with the feeling of reward that comes from love and attachment for a salient other and with exposure to representations of that object of attachment. \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nAs far as we are aware, this is the first study to use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess evidence for the neural correlates of maternal responding. Systematic review ensures that all studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria are included and are identified using an explicit search technique. This reduces selection bias when describing positive findings from the research literature. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative method for integrating findings with the advantages that (1) consistent regional effects are identified (and inconsistent ones discarded), (2) statistical power is increased and (3) use of coordinate data avoids the problems of different neuro-anatomical labelling systems which may be present in the primary studies. \n\nOf the nine included studies, three included only first-time mothers (Nitschke et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ). A limited literature has addressed the impact of \u2018first time\u2019 mothering on maternal brain responsiveness (e.g. Strathearn et al.  ), maternal sensitivity (e.g. Elmadih et al.  ) or oxytocin responsiveness (Feldman et al.  ). However, no significant differences were found in these parameters in relation to first-time mothering, possibly because the lack of experience with parenting, seen in first-time mothers reflected as maternal \u2018competency\u2019 rather than maternal \u2018sensitivity\u2019. \n\nThere are some important limitations to consider. None of the included studies compared mothers\u2019 responses to own infants with responses to other key attachment figures including romantic partners or other reward stimuli. It is not possible, therefore, to establish whether activation of the identified brain areas are unique to mothers being exposed to their infants. We do not believe that the quality of included studies caused the relative lack of brain areas showing significant activation following meta-analysis. It may be simply that even the relatively minor variations in paradigms between studies produced too much change in voxel-based foci of activation to generate meaningful results in meta-analysis. The GingerALE software advises that studies with similar paradigms can be used, but the use of a standardised maternal sensitivity paradigm may be of considerable value in generating more reproducible and robust results, as will be discussed below. Interpretation of patterns of activation may also be compromised because stimuli were only representations of children and, although some stimuli were videos which provide more ecological validity, the visual stimuli were presented without auditory (Swain and Lorberbaum  ), olfactory (Porter et al.  ) or tactile cues (Kaitz et al.  ); all of which induce maternal neural responses. Although stimulus modalities are not regularly combined within studies, addition of such cues could add ecological validity to future research designs. \n\nMost (but not all) of the included studies (Nitschke et al.  ; Lenzi et al.  ; Strathearn et al.  ; Barrett et al.  ; Wan et al.  ; Abel et al.  ) clearly specified using only right-handed mothers. This variation could potentially have impacted the interpretation of activation localisation for example in areas such as the precentral gyrus (although we found bilateral activation of this area)\u2014future studies would benefit from clearly specifying handedness. \n\nAs in any meta-analysis, the studies with more participants may have greater effect on the final results, skewing them towards findings in those studies. Similarly, heterogeneity between samples, stimuli and designs may reduce areas of brain activation identified. We minimised this bias by eliminating studies with infants older than 24\u00a0months (the oldest infants in the included studies were 16\u00a0months) which provided an acceptably narrow range given the nature of meta-analysis requiring integration of individual paradigms. All studies used unknown children as control stimuli. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nOur findings suggest that future imaging research in mothers should be collaborative. This would allow standardisation of experimental fMRI paradigms using a greater number and a more demographically diverse subject group (e.g. ethnicity or parity). This is key to increasing statistical power and robustness of the results (Dale  ). \n\nWe also suggest comparisons with matched non-mothers, mothers with varying behavioural maternal sensitivity (Elmadih et al.  ), mothers with mental illness (Abel et al.  ) and fathers of the same infant, as piloted by Swain et al. ( ). Infant temperament and sociality is known to regulate and interact with maternal behaviour, but few studies have examined this in relation to maternal neural responses. Infant eye tracking could be employed alongside fMRI to explore such associations further. Multisite collaboration is also required to recruit mothers from hard-to-access groups (e.g. those with severe mental illness) which may be associated with poor maternal sensitivity so that we may optimise the patient and public benefits of this innovative research stream. Although much can be done to share fMRI stimuli and analysis paradigms, cross-country, intergroup funding applications are key to facilitate such an approach in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nFunctional imaging is increasingly employed to study the neurobiology underpinning human parental response. Regional brain activation may serve as a benchmark of healthy responsiveness. Research is beginning to detail ways in which brain responses to infants may be modulated in new parents. Such approaches are likely to be of increasing interest in the development of novel parenting interventions; for example, those involving the administration of intranasal oxytocin alone or in combination with behavioural approaches. However, its utility can only be exploited to improve clinical outcomes if studies produce consistent results and many studies have been too small and varied to do so. Meta-analysis provides a powerful technique whereby fMRI data can be integrated to identify robust changes. This study highlights the importance of using meta-analysis, as well as common experimental designs, to allow larger sample sizes. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6440933,"text_md5":"925e5d8a4968abedd836436f2f1e745e","field_positions":{"authors":[0,231],"journal":[232,255],"publication_year":[257,261],"title":[272,347],"keywords":[361,410],"abstract":[423,2031],"body":[2040,29391]},"batch":1,"pmid":29987638,"doi":"10.1007\/s00737-018-0878-2","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6440933","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6440933"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6440933\">6440933<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6440933  Neural pathways of maternal responding: systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Such data-pooling can be achieved through meta-analysis (the pooled analysis of published results), mega-analysis (the pooled analysis of raw data) or multi-site studies, which can be seen as designed mega-analyses. Current limitations in function-location brain mapping and how data-pooling can be used to remediate them are reviewed, with particular attention to power aggregation and mitigation of false positive results. Some recently developed analysis tools for meta- and mega-analysis are also presented, and recommendations for the conduct of valid fMRI data pooling are formulated. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA goal of brain mapping in healthy subjects is to associate mental functions with specific brain locations. In its clinical application, brain mapping aims at identifying the location of brain activation differences between persons suffering from a given neurological or psychiatric disorder and healthy controls during the performance of a cognitive task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the main tool in the brain mapping field as, relative to other techniques, it is non-invasive, has increased spatial resolution, wider availability and lower cost (Pekar,  ). Conversely, brain mapping studies represent well over half of the fMRI literature to date (Logothetis,  ). \n\nIt has been recognized that data pooling across individual studies has the potential to significantly accelerate progress in the brain mapping field (Van Horn et al.,  ), following other successful data-sharing initiatives, such as The Human Genome Project (Collins and Mansoura,  ). The most immediate advantage of data pooling is an increase in power due to the larger number of subjects available for analysis. Data pooling across scanning centers can also lead to a more heterogeneous and potentially representative participant sample. Finally, the study of the causes of variability across related experiments may also lead to novel scientific insights (Matthews et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ). \n\nMeta-analysis techniques based on published coordinates of activation have been used since early on to summarize research data and generate novel insights (Fox et al.,  ). Mega-analysis, defined as the pooling of the fMRI time-series, has been less successful so far in spite of its much greater potential, probably due to the difficulty in databasing and making publicly available these \u201craw\u201d data, and a lack of specific analysis methods that recognize the additional heterogeneity introduced by different scanning centers. Such difficulties may be easing as the field evolves towards multi-site studies (Schumann,  ), which can be seen as designed mega-analyses, and the necessary databasing, data-sharing and analysis tools are emerging (Keator et al.,  ,  ; Bockholt et al.,  ). \n\nIn the following, current limitations in function-location brain mapping are examined, along with strategies for their remediation through data pooling. Following the meta\/mega-analysis distinction frequently employed in the field, the advantages and shortcomings of different types of data-sharing based on the type of data used as prime matter for pooling are also discussed. Finally, the different steps for a valid data pooling exercise, from data collection to the selection of suitable analysis methods, are considered. \n\n\n## Limitations in Brain Mapping and Data-Pooling Remedies \n  \n### Erroneous results in single-study fMRI analysis \n  \nThe aim of conventional group analysis of fMRI data is to detect the regions that show significant increases in BOLD signal in response to a given task. For explanatory purposes, a comparison between an active task and a baseline condition will be assumed, although the following reasoning can be easily extended to more complex designs. Localizing significant changes is often done through voxelwise hypothesis testing, where a null (  H  ) and an alternative (  H  ) hypothesis are compared. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in mean signal across subjects between the active and the baseline tasks, while the alternative hypothesis states that such difference exists. The decision as to whether or not   H   should be rejected in favor of   H   is then made on the basis of the value of a suitable test (e.g.   t  -test). Table   presents the possible decision outcomes. \n  \n Outcomes of hypothesis testing  . \n  \n#### False positive results \n  \nThis mapping strategy is liable to false positive (FP) findings, if   H   is rejected when it is in fact correct, that is if the area declared to be active was truly not engaged by the active task. The probability \u03b1 of a FP result can be kept acceptably low by using multiple comparisons control procedures such as the random field theory (Worsley et al.,  ). In practice, the level of FP results in the literature is likely to be higher than the conventional 5% value of \u03b1, as uncorrected results are sometimes reported and sub-optimal fixed-effects group analysis is still occasionally used. \n\nHowever, under the assumption that FP appear at random brain locations, aggregating results across studies is likely to result in improved brain mapping accuracy in the sense of FP reduction, as a FP finding in a given region is unlikely to be replicated across studies (Fox et al.,  ). In other words, the more studies which have reported that a given area is recruited by a certain paradigm, the less likely it is to be a false positive result. This idea can be formalized: if an observed level of replication in a given location across studies is greater than what would be expected by chance alone, then the null hypothesis of a FP result can be rejected. Recent years have seen the development of several voxel-based meta-analysis methods (Chein et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Neumann et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The initial breakthrough was provided by the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method presented by Turkeltaub et al. ( ). ALE is a kernel-based approach currently implemented in BrainMap, an online database of published studies (Laird et al.,  ). In kernel-based methods, individual studies are represented by a pattern of activation peak coordinates, which are smoothed using a spatial kernel function (Silverman,  ). The smoothed patterns are aggregated to obtain a summary map with voxel-level scores representing the local density of activation peaks. This summary map is then thresholded using simulation (Wager et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) or parametric (Costafreda et al.,  ) approaches, and the areas that survive the threshold are declared as true positive activations. Voxel-based meta-analysis techniques have liberated the meta-analysis process from simple counting of anatomical labels reported by each study and have increased sensitivity to detect aggregate sub-regional activations. A workflow example for one of such methods, Parametric Voxel-based Meta-analysis (PVM, software available from the author; Costafreda et al.,  ), is presented in Figure  . \n  \n Parametric Voxel-based Meta-analysis  . Step 1: the coordinates for each study are plotted in standard space brain (MNI). Step 2: After smoothing with a uniform kernel of size   r  , each study map is transformed into an indicator map, where voxels with 1 values (red) indicate the presence of at least one activation within distance   r  . Step 3: all study-level indicator maps are summed and then divided by the number of studies   n  , to obtain a summary map reflecting the proportion of studies reporting an activation within distance   r   of each voxel. Step 4: the   p   value of the observed proportion is computed, under the null hypothesis that the activations are generated at random spatial locations. The final thresholded map reflects the areas where the proportion of studies reporting activation is too high to have been generated by such null random process alone. In this example of a meta-analysis of language production in healthy subjects, Broca's area and anterior cingulate are revealed as areas of significant activation (Costafreda et al.,  ). \n  \n\n#### False negative results \n  \nBrain mapping also suffers from False Negative (FN) reporting, when a region truly active during the task is not recognized as such. This problem is exacerbated by the low number of subjects and, hence, low power that is common in fMRI research. Using a 3T scanner, Thirion et al. ( ) estimated that at least 20 and preferably 27 or more subjects were needed to obtain reproducible results with a simple sensori-motor task under random-effects assumptions. Although specific to the particular scanner, task and analysis employed by the authors, these findings suggest that many fMRI studies may be underpowered. Additionally, Thirion et al. ( ) also found that high inter-subject variability was the key element producing low reliability of group mapping. Factors which increase inter-subject variability in BOLD response, such as the inclusion of psychiatric or neurological populations, will therefore require larger samples. \n\nUnder certain conditions, data pooling may also result in an increase of power to detect brain activations and therefore a decrease in FN results. It is this potential for increased power through the aggregation of sub-significant results that underpins meta-analysis applications in most fields (Whitehead,  ). This type of effect-size meta-analysis is based on study-level estimates of a given scalar effect size (e.g. difference in treatment effects across clinical trials) plus, crucially, the standard error of such estimates. Effect sizes from several studies are then statistically pooled to obtain a summary effect size, which has increased precision over any of the original studies. \n\nAn equivalent for fMRI research of this primary data would be the (group-level) effect size image or \u201cbeta map\u201d accompanied by its corresponding standard error image. However, fMRI researchers rarely publish the complete statistical images, but instead present a highly compact and refined, but impoverished, representation of the original brain activation maps. Regions of significant brain activation, also known as \u201cblobs\u201d, are three-dimensional structures which approximately follow grey matter distribution and its associated complicated topography. As a description of such structures, only a list of three-dimensional coordinates is available in a standard paper, usually the points of maximum activation (most statistically significant voxel) for each blob, or its centroid. Results published in this format also lack a measure of variance (i.e. standard error), which precludes the use of traditional effect-size meta-analytical techniques (Fleiss,  ). \n\nKernel-based meta-analysis methods can be seen as an attempt to recover a richer representation by deeming as active not only the point of the activation coordinates, but also some neighboring area (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ). Non-active areas are simply represented by zero. An unavoidable consequence of this impoverished representation is that subtleties in the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the blobs are lost when studies are pooled. Another result is that because the (non-significant) measurements of non-active areas are also lost and simply coded as zero it is not possible to add non-significant findings across studies to decide whether the pooled outcome does, in fact, reach significance. In other words, meta-analysis of coordinate-based data cannot aggregate power across studies and thus cannot remediate the FN problem. Improvements in power can only be obtained through mega-analysis. \n\nIn fact, current meta-analysis techniques for brain mapping can be described, from a statistical point of view, as spatial vote-counting (Hedges and Olkin,  ), where each study \u201cvotes\u201d through its reported peak coordinates on whether a particular location is active or not. Vote-counting is a less than ideal technique for research synthesis in statistical terms (Hedges and Olkin,  ). In particular for fMRI research, detection of significant activation in a given study is a factor of both activation effect size and power, mainly determined by its sample size. Given that sample size is usually limited in typical fMRI experiments, there is scope for misleading findings when aggregating vote-counting results. \n\n\n\n### Variability in experimental design, power and generalization \n  \nFrom the previous discussion, it can be seen that the initial appeal of pooling fMRI data is therefore a very practical one: to increase the reliability of findings and the power of the statistical analysis. However, this comes at a price: relative to a single large-scale study, a multi-site (or analogously multi-study) design of a similar scale would suffer from inflated variability in its fMRI measurements. This is because it is rare that independent fMRI experiments can be considered exact replicates of each other. For instance, Matthews et al. ( ) described how a subtle variation in the visual presentation of the cue for a simple hand-tapping task across centers in a multi-center study generated significant between-study variability in visual cortical BOLD responses. Findings such as this one suggest that minor changes in experimental conditions may result in significant differences in brain activation. Examples of experimental characteristics with empirical evidence of an effect on fMRI results include: scanner strength (Friedman et al.,  ), subject sample composition (D'Esposito et al.,  ) and analysis method (Strother et al.,  ). The resulting inflation in variability of the fMRI measurements due to these between-study or between-site factors, even when a standardised protocol across sites is enforced (Zou et al.,  ; Friedman et al.,  ) may reduce the statistical power relative to a large single-site design. \n\nAlthough optimal from the point of view of maximising statistical power, recruitment and other pragmatic issues have tended to make such large-scale single site studies an exception in neuroimaging. Particularly when elusive clinical samples are necessary, recruitment difficulties may recommend a multi-site design (see for example the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Mueller et al.,  ). Also, for many research questions, a sample of relevant studies already exists, and pooling results across this sample through meta- and mega-analysis techniques will often be a more efficient use of these data than considering the findings of each study in isolation (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). \n\nApart from the above practical considerations, the increased variability inherent to multi-site or multi-study design is not necessarily detrimental, and can even present advantages for certain research questions. The main potential benefit is that including participants from different sites may lead to a more representative sample of participants, an important consideration if the results of the analysis are intended to be generalized to the population at large. Additionally, activations that generalize over sites and studies are more likely to be linked to the substantive research question under consideration than to idiosyncrasies in study design. As an illustration, the discovery of the resting state brain network in an early mega-analysis was \u201c(\u2026) particularly compelling because these activity decreases were remarkably consistent across a wide variety of task conditions\u201d (Raichle and Snyder,  ). Data pooling can then be useful to quantitatively examine the generalization of a finding by pooling the results of related studies performed under different conditions. Finally, the causes of between-study variability may also be of interest in themselves. In Costafreda et al. ( ), we applied a meta-regression approach to a large sample of experiments on emotional processing to identify the study characteristics that predicted amygdala activation. Independent predictors of amygdala activation included the type of emotion depicted in the experimental stimuli (e.g. fear), along with more \u201cmethodological\u201d variables such as modality of presentation of the stimulus or scanner strength. \n\n\n### Reverse inference \n  \nReverse inference in functional neuroimaging is the deduction of the presence of a particular cognitive process as a component of a task due to the engagement of the region (or set of regions) during the task (Poldrack,  ). An example of reverse inference is concluding that reward may be present during a particular task on the basis of observing activation in striatum. Although problematic from a logical point of view, used cautiously reverse inference may be useful to elucidate the component processes for a task, and it is often used by functional neuroimaging practitioners (Poldrack,  ). \n\nIn Costafreda et al. ( ) we reported quantitative estimates of the selectivity of amygdala for different emotions relative to neutral material. For example, we found that the amygdala is four to seven times more likely to be activated by fear than by stimuli of neutral content. This probabilistic estimate may be useful in the interpretation of a particular study finding by quantifying the specificity of the link between an area (or network) and a cognitive process. This estimate also acts as an explicit reminder of the limitations in reverse inference, in that such link is not absolute, but probabilistic and necessarily relative to an alternative state (in this example, a neutral stimulus). Therefore, detecting amygdala activation in a particular experiment cannot lead to the conclusion that the task must have involved a fearful stimulus, but simply that it is more likely that the stimulus was fearful than neutral. Additionally, this single estimate cannot exclude a number of credible alternatives, such as amygdala reactivity to social stimuli   per se   or emotions other than fear. \n\n\n### Spatial resolution and functional segregation \n  \nThe spatial resolution of fMRI has been estimated as a point spread function with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 3.5\u2009mm for 1.5\u2009T scanners (Engel et al.,  ) and as low as 2\u2009mm for 7\u2009T scanners (Shmuel et al.,  ). However, inter-subject variability in cytoarchitecture is substantial (Amunts et al.,  ), which significantly reduces the resolution obtainable at group level. In addition, the analysis of fMRI data usually involves Gaussian filtering, with typical filter sizes (FWHM) being in the range of 6\u201315\u2009mm, thus further limiting the effective resolution obtained in practice. \n\nSpatial resolution is particularly relevant to the study of functional segregation. Functional segregation aims to delineate discrete cortical regions along functional lines. Very fine-grained examinations of functional segregation have been attempted by pooling results from different studies (Picard and Strick,  ). In Costafreda et al. ( ; Figure  ), we developed a quantitative method to determine whether two sets of activation peaks are spatially segregated in their cortical distribution. We applied this method to the analysis of verbal fluency studies demonstrating different distributions for the activation peaks of phonological and semantic studies within Broca's area. The significant difference in mean location identified between both distributions (2\u201318\u2009mm) was comparable or below the usual resolution of any single study. \n  \n Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the mean locations of peak activations in a meta-analysis of phonological and semantic verbal fluency activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus  . Updated version of the analysis in Costafreda et al. ( ): the systematic literature search has been updated to September 2008 with a total of 25 studies included, and the bootstrap method has been modified to take into account the clustered nature (activations within studies) of the data. The conclusions are the same as the ones in the published paper. Left lateral view of a rendered image of the brain (MNI template). The confidence intervals (CI) for the mean location of peak BOLD responses associated with semantic verbal fluency (red) were significantly more ventral (  z  -axis) than for those for phonological verbal fluency (blue) at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Areas of intersections of the CI (phonological semantic) are shown in mauve. \n  \n\n\n## A Typology of fMRI Data-Pooling \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \n#### Activation coordinates as primary data \n  \nAlmost all the pooling exercises to date have been meta-analysis, conducted using the coordinates of the location of activations as the primary data. Some of this popularity may be due to the availability of coordinate data, which has become a standard of neuroimaging reporting (Laird et al.,  ). As discussed earlier, its main disadvantage is the impossibility to aggregate power across studies. Therefore most meta-analyses compute estimates of between-study reliability of activations, although many other coordinate-based approaches are possible, such as the examination of between-study co-activation of brain as a proxy of functional connectivity (Toro et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Meta-analysis using additional descriptors \n  \nNeuroimaging publications often report both coordinates of peak or maximum activation and their associated anatomical label. Meta-analysis based on labels (Laird et al.,  ), or a combination of labels and coordinates (Costafreda et al.,  ) is possible, and can even be more powerful than voxel-based meta-analysis when the number of studies is low (<10) as multiple testing is reduced from the number of voxels to the number of regions. However, the variability in anatomical nomenclature in published studies can be a serious limitation. Additionally, voxel-based meta-analysis may be more sensitive if the clustering of activations across studies is not well matched by the chosen anatomical label (Laird et al.,  ). \n\nOften, in addition to location coordinates, additional measures of the activation characteristics are reported. If the volume of the activated \u201cblobs\u201d was consistently reported, then it could be used for more accurate approximation of the original activations. In our experience though, volume of activation is not consistently\u2009reported. \n\nOften the   T   or   Z   statistics of significant activations are also reported. It is possible to employ these quantities to generate effect size meta-analyses. The difficulty with this approach, however, consists of how to handle non-significant effects, for which no effect size estimate is given: are we to assume these unknown effect sizes are zero, or just below significance, or simply exclude them from the dataset? In our view any of these alternatives leads to further difficulties in the form of potential biases of our results, while the benefit is only an apparent increase in power (apparent because the subsignificant results are unknown). \n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the serious limitations inherent in coordinate-based data, and short of a decided move towards full voxel-based reporting of significant and non-significant effect sizes discussed below, coordinates are currently the best available substrate for meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n### Mega-analysis \n  \n#### fMRI time-series as primary data \n  \nAs the raw time-series contains the record of all the measurements obtained during an fMRI experiment, it would seem the obvious prime matter for data pooling: mega-analysis can reduce both false positive and false negative results. However, three practical difficulties have severely limited the application of this approach. First, fMRI measurements from a single study typically generate gigabytes of data. Databasing such large volumes of information and making it publicly available is no trivial technical task (Van Horn et al.,  ; Bockholt et al.,  ). Secondly, fMRI data sharing initiatives have in the past sparked serious objections in the scientific community, which has often proven reticent to share data that are difficult and expensive to acquire (Koslow,  ). Only a very small fraction of fMRI experiments are nowadays publicly available for download. Finally, there is currently a paucity of quantitative methods that are able to cope with the processing complexity that may arise in fMRI data mega-analysis. These factors create a classical egg and chicken situation: as very limited data are available for download, limited effort is put into developing mega-analysis methods, which in turn further limits the appeal of data-sharing in this format. \n\nThis situation, however, is starting to change. Empirical studies have shown low scanner-related variance relative to between-subject variability and measurement error (Costafreda et al.,  ; Suckling et al.,  ) thus encouraging multi-center designs and associated databasing technology (Keator et al.,  ). Methods of analysis are also starting to reflect the need for large-scale integration of results (Pinel et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ; Dinov et al.,  ; Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ), as discussed below. \n\n\n#### Statistical maps as intermediate format \n  \nThe complexity in databasing and publishing time-series data would be reduced if instead statistical brain maps were made publicly available. If effect-size brain maps were accompanied by their standard error images, then usual effect-size meta-analysis methods could be applied (Whitehead,  ), and power could be aggregated across studies with smaller databasing overheads. Additionally, standard random-effects fMRI analysis techniques could be used validly on such summaries (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). If subject-level statistical maps, rather than group-level maps, were to be released, this would also allow the examination of the causes of between-subject variability, which has been consistently identified as the main source of heterogeneity in fMRI measurements (Zou et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ; Thirion et al.,  ; Suckling et al.,  ). \n\nIn spite of its convenience, it must be stressed that such intermediate data format would also have its disadvantages. Temporal data, and therefore, connectivity information, would be lost in the translation. Relative to time-series pooling, extraneous variability would also be introduced by those statistical maps, as different labs would report maps obtained through varying pre-processing and first-level analysis approaches. \n\n\n\n\n## Requirements and Analysis Tools for Valid fMRI Data Pooling \n  \n### Systematic search strategy \n  \nThe validity of data pooling is crucially dependent on which studies are included. In effect-size meta-analysis, a particularly important problem is publication bias. Also known as the \u201cfile-drawer\u201d problem, it originates from the fact that negative studies are less likely to be published, biasing the overall estimate of effect size towards higher values (Sterne and Egger,  ). Unbiased, exhaustive and   a priori   literature-sampling strategies are necessary to ensure the inclusion of all relevant studies, or at least of a representative sample, of which only clearly flawed or inadequate studies should be excluded. It is worth insisting that these sampling considerations also apply to mega-analysis of fMRI data, as negative studies may be less likely to be represented in publicly available data repositories. In our view, databases containing the results of fMRI experiments (e.g. Brainmap, fMRIDC) (Laird et al.,  ) should be used to complement the systematic literature search bearing in mind the caveat they do not include all potential studies, and the criteria for inclusion in the database are often not explicitly stated, creating room for selection biases. By contrast, in coordinate-based meta-analysis, the focus of the analysis is usually the determination of the location of an effect, which may be less affected by the exclusion of non-significant results (Fox et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Study as a random effect \n  \nBoth meta- and mega-analysis require analysis methods adapted to the specificities of pooling data across experimental designs. As discussed earlier, functional MRI experiments are highly heterogeneous in their subjective recruitment strategies, cognitive paradigms, acquisition software and hardware, and analysis methods. Even with standardized protocols and adequate data preprocessing (Zou et al.,  ; Friedman et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ) two fMRI measurements coming from the same center can be expected to be more similar to each other than what would be expected by chance alone, compromising crucial independence assumptions inherent to most analysis methods. Therefore, the existence of multiple sites for data acquisition will in most cases have to be recognized during data analysis as well. \n\nIn the analysis of the efficacy of clinical interventions, meta-analysis of (scalar) data from heterogeneous trials is also the rule (Whitehead,  ). It is often dealt with in a double strategy: (1) by employing study-level covariates that are likely to explain some of the study heterogeneity as fixed-effects in a meta-regression approach, and (2) through the inclusion of a study-level error term capturing residual inter-study variability. This second point is equivalent to treating the study factor as a random effect, in a similar way as subjects are treated in fMRI group-level estimates (Mumford and Nichols,  ). \n\nMeta- and mega-analysis of functional imaging data could benefit from a similar approach. The study should therefore be recognized as a further level in the usual fMRI data hierarchy of task runs within subjects within studies (Penny et al.,  ). Most methods currently in use for fMRI meta-analysis, however, consider the foci of activation as the independent observations and ignore the clustering of coordinates in the original studies (Chein et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Neumann et al.,  ). These approaches are therefore fixed-effects meta-analysis techniques. The results of fixed-effects meta-analysis only apply to the specific sample of experiments under consideration and cannot be generalized to a population of studies if between-study heterogeneity is present. In practical terms, the main undesirable consequence of omitting study-level clustering is that statistically significant density can be obtained with fixed-effects methods simply by the report of several contiguous foci by a single paper, which may have been obtained through overly generous statistical thresholding and thus a marker of poor study quality (Wager et al.,  ). Random-effects alternatives for fMRI meta-analysis have been recently developed using simulation-based (Wager et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ) and parametric analytical approaches (Costafreda et al.,  ), and should in our view be preferentially employed. \n\nIn particular, PVM (Costafreda et al.,  ; Figure  ) is a statistical method for function-location meta-analysis that allows valid, powerful, fast and scalable detection of the areas with significance concordance between studies for maps expressed in proportions. That is, the statistic computed in this approach is, for each voxel, the proportion of studies that have reported activation within a pre-determined local neighbourhood. Proportions are \u201cnatural\u201d random effects estimators, in the sense of taking between-study variability into account. They are also easily interpretable, even when translated into a map. Finally proportions, and ratios between proportions, can be directly used as quantitative estimates of probability, for example as guidance in reverse inference. \n\nRegarding mega-analysis, the existence of study-level clustering effects would need to be recognized through, for example, the introduction of a study level in the analysis hierarchy (e.g. runs within tasks within subjects within group within centers\/studies). If the highest-level, \u201ctop\u201d summary map is of interest, a random-effects analysis can be obtained through the application of split-level analysis using usual software libraries, such as FSL (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). Costafreda et al. ( ) presents a mega-analysis tool that may be useful for more complex designs, especially in the presence of clusters (families, studies) with potentially low degrees of freedom. If covariate estimation is required, then clusters with low counts may present an identifiability problem (if number of parameters\u2009\u2265 items in cluster). The Bayesian all-in-one approach allows the estimates to \u201cborrow strength\u201d across clusters, thus stabilizing the model fitting process (Bowman et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Study differences as fixed effects \n  \nAs discussed earlier, heterogeneous experimental designs are inevitable in many data pooling situations. Some of this heterogeneity may have direct consequences on the results of the experiments. Known or suspected sources of heterogeneity may be controlled at the study selection step by restriction, for example by only including studies with exclusively right-handed samples in a language meta-analysis. At the analysis step, covariates can be included as fixed effects in a meta-regression strategy (Costafreda et al.,  ). Covariate adjustment is often an attractive option, because the addition of the extraneous factor as a covariate maximizes power both by allowing the inclusion of a larger number of studies than if a restrictive approach had been used, and by removing the variability associated with the covariate factor. Whether a covariate is, in fact, influencing the summary findings can then also be determined, which may be interesting in itself. \n\nFinally, if the covariate is associated with both the outcome under study and the predictor of primary interest, this association may result in confounding, which would lead to biased meta-analytical findings if not taken into account (Greenland et al.,  ; Lawlor et al.,  ). A hypothetical example of confounding would be created if fMRI was a more sensitive technique than PET, and experiments on negative emotions were mostly done with fMRI while those on positive emotions were conducted with PET. Thus, ignoring this potential confounding effect in the analysis would create an apparent increase in the probability of amygdala activation for negative over positive emotions. Two difficulties have to be acknowledged when dealing with confounding. First, potential confounders are not always accurately measured. For example, while functional neuroimaging publications do not always disclose enough methodological detail to ascertain whether fixed or random-effects multisubject analysis was performed, this methodological choice influences the sensitivity and generalizability of the analysis (Friston et al.,  ). Accurate and extensive meta-data collection is thus a pre-requisite for pooled data analysis, which should benefit from recent advances in automated meta-data collection (Bockholt et al.,  ). Second, the number of potential confounding factors that can be effectively introduced in the analysis depends ultimately on the size of the available dataset. A general rule-of-thumb in linear modeling is that one predictor may be included for each 10\u2009independent observations (Harrell,  ), although newer statistical approaches may be able to remediate this limitation (Fu et al.,  ). If these steps for heterogeneity control are not available, for example due to incomplete information, then the likely impact of potential confounding factors should be addressed when discussing the results (Costafreda et al.,  ). \n\nCrucially, random and fixed-effects strategies are not competing alternatives to deal with between-study heterogeneity. When possible, pertinent covariates can be used in a meta-regression to explain some of the variability or to study the causes for between-study heterogeneity. Additionally, all attempts at fMRI data pooling should include a study-level error even if study factors are already included as fixed effects, because it is unlikely that the measured covariates capture all the between-study variability. \n\n\n\n## The Value of fMRI Data Pooling \n  \nPooling data across sites responds primarily to pragmatic necessities, such as the maximization of sample size, especially in elusive clinical populations. It can also satisfy the need to utilize already existing, but frequently underpowered, neuroimaging studies in a more efficient way than the consideration of their individual findings. Last but not least, as fMRI research grows exponentially, quantitative synthesis of published fMRI research will remain necessary simply to allow researchers a summary of a mountain of research data. As functional neuroimaging becomes more data-rich, such computational approaches able to extract novel insights from existing large-scale datasets are likely to become increasingly valuable. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":2759345,"text_md5":"90835336151aafb515d1060d17065573","field_positions":{"authors":[0,20],"journal":[21,43],"publication_year":[45,49],"title":[60,132],"keywords":[146,266],"abstract":[279,1058],"body":[1067,37551]},"batch":1,"pmid":19826498,"doi":"10.3389\/neuro.11.033.2009","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2759345","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2759345"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2759345\">2759345<\/a>","list_title":"PMC2759345  Pooling fMRI Data: Meta-Analysis, Mega-Analysis and Multi-Center Studies"}

Results: GD showed greater bilateral clusters of activation compared with HC, mainly located in the head and body of the caudate, right middle frontal gyrus, right putamen, and hypothalamus. Differently, AUD showed enhanced activation compared with HC in the right lentiform nucleus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the precuneus; it also showed clusters of deactivation in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left middle cingulate cortex, and inferior portion of the left putamen. Conclusions: Going beyond the limitations of a single study approach, these findings provide evidence, for the first time, that both disorders are associated with specific neural alterations in the neural network for executive functions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) [ ] and its revised edition (DSM-IV-TR) [ ], pathological gambling (PG) was defined as an impulse control disorder (not otherwise specified) and characterized by \u201cpersistent, recurrent and maladaptive behavior that compromises personal, family or work activities\u201d [ ]. In contrast with the previous classification, in the DSM-5 [ ] Gambling Disorder (GD) is currently included within the spectrum of dependencies and disorders related to substance use (substance-related and addictive disorders). It is described as a chronic and relapsing disorder that affects an individual\u2019s health and sociality, mainly due to addictive behavior (i.e., individuals aim to continue playing despite losing money), loss of control (i.e., despite willingness to stop, they cannot avoid playing again), withdrawal syndrome (i.e., physical and psychological feelings of discomfort when gambling is stopped), and craving (i.e., the compulsive desire to play again). \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the co-occurrence of one or more addictive behaviors (i.e., poly-dependence conditions, namely, different substances and\/or gambling addiction in the same individual), as well as cross-dependence (i.e., shifting from one type of addiction to another in the lifespan) [ , , ]. Accordingly, the current literature on GD has evidenced comorbidity with substance-related abuse and addictive disorders (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, and illegal psychoactive substances), in addition to comorbidity with other diseases, such as depression, hypomania, bipolar disorder; and personality disorders (i.e., antisocial, narcissistic, histrionic, borderline), attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia); and other medical disorders associated with stress, including peptic ulcer and arterial hypertension [ ]. Moreover, several studies investigating the neurophysiological correlates of addictive behaviors and the similarities between drug addiction and behavioral addictions, such as GD, have shown that compulsive behaviors may produce a physiological activation (i.e., arousal) similar to psychoactive substances [ ]. \n\nAlcohol Use Disorder (AUD) involves deficits in controlling alcohol consumption, extreme concern about alcohol, substance consumption even when it causes problems, the need to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to achieve the same effect, or the presence of withdrawal symptoms (the individual has symptoms such as irritability and emotional outbursts, anxiety, low energy, trouble sleeping, memory problems, dizziness, increased accident proneness, delayed reflexes) when the individual quickly reduces or stops drinking [ ]. Harmful alcohol consumption includes the use of alcohol that affects an individual\u2019s health and\/or safety, also yielding to other alcohol-related disorders (i.e., alcoholic liver disease, peptic ulcers, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and alcoholic dementia). It also includes binge drinking, in which five or more drinks are consumed within two hours. Alcohol abuse can have different effects on different individuals, and many theories suggest that individual factors, such as genetic, psychological, social, and environmental variables, are involved [ ]. Alcohol consumption usually begins in adolescence, but alcohol consumption disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, although it may begin at any age [ ]. The risk factors include drinking steadily over time, early age of onset, family history, depression or other mental health problems, and a history of trauma, as well as social and cultural factors [ ]. \n\nFollowing the recent inclusion of GD among the spectrum of dependencies in the DSM-5 [ ], a number of studies have attempted to disentangle the common traits of GD and drug addiction. Interestingly, GD and AUD have similar characteristics, such as decision-making deficits and impulsivity, which are also related to relapse and poor therapeutic outcomes. Recent studies on the etiology of GD and AUD report that these two conditions are frequently associated in the same individual (i.e., comorbidity) [ , , ]. Additionally, GD incidence is up to 10 times higher in alcohol-dependent patients than in the general population [ ]. One of the possible reasons for the high comorbidity of AUD and GD is their biological and phenomenological similarity [ ]. Specifically, AUD and GD seem to be associated with common clinical features, such as compulsive engagement in a behavior, decreased control over problematic behaviors, craving states, withdrawal symptoms, unsuccessful efforts to stop, and disturbances in the main areas of functioning [ ]. Both conditions have been described as sharing a common neurobiological mechanism, which consists of neurofunctional alterations in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [ ]. Moreover, both disorders are associated with specific cognitive-emotional mechanisms, including the processing of rewards\/punishments and its relation to behavioral conditioning; the increase in the relevance of particular stimuli [ ], which often translates into an uncontrolled desire to gamble\/drink (craving) [ , ]; and impulsiveness [ , , , ], which is considered both a factor of vulnerability to developing addictions and\/or the factor that often leads to relapses. Regarding the social context, the prevalence of GD is closely related to the availability and expansion of gambling establishments [ ]; this is also true for AUD, since alcohol is usually easily available on the market. Moreover, in contrast to other dependence conditions, such as the use of psychoactive drugs that are stigmatized from the very first encounter, both gambling and alcohol drinking are widely accepted by society as leisure-time activities. \n\nThe present literature review suggests that the definition of \u201cexecutive functions\u201d includes a large umbrella of multiple processes and several, different definition of executive function exist, which refer to different cognitive and neuropsychological models. Therefore, we found that in studying executive functions in GD and in AUD, authors referred to different models and, accordingly, used different tasks to analyze executive functions. The problems of the absence of a homogenous definition of executive function and the large variety of tools used to assess them in the clinical population has already been underlined in other meta-analyses [ ]. \n\nHere, we provide a revision of the current neuropsychological and neuroimaging literature on AUD and GD, evidencing possible differences or common features of the two conditions. The above-reported literature suggests that both conditions yield alterations in executive functions and the associated brain networks. Thus, we perform a meta-analysis on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies assessing executive functions (e.g., decision-making, delay discounting, inhibitory response) in individuals with AUD and GD with two main aims, namely (1) summarizing previous findings about the neural correlates of the two conditions in terms of the activation and\/or deactivation of the brain areas devoted to executive control, and (2) providing new evidence for common and distinct neural mechanisms in these two conditions. \n\n\n## 2. Neuropsychological Features of GD and AUD \n  \nThe pathophysiology of GD, which seems to have common traits with drug addiction [ ] and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders [ ], suggests the possibility of a common psychobiological substrate. GD should result from a strong and complicated interaction between individual vulnerability and environmental factors. This type of behavioral dependence can affect brain functions without the harmful biochemical effects caused by neurotoxic substances. A neuropsychological study of patients with GD identified common traits in neurological patients affected by frontal lobe damage [ ], involving an impairment of the decision-making processes; this decision-making deficit leads gamblers to not consider, and thus to ignore, the negative consequences of the immediate reward, inducing them to overestimate the real chances of winning by relying on erroneous beliefs. Patients with GD are more likely to have a reduced sensitivity of the reward system and to be more prone to seek gratifying events. A prevalent symptom in GD is certainly the strong impulse to gamble, which often leads to a relapse [ , ]. Impulsiveness is considered both a factor of vulnerability to developing addictions and a consequence of GD and a deficit in decision-making processes [ ]. Potenza and colleagues [ ] used the Stroop test to assess neurofunctional alterations associated with deficits in the inhibition of automatic responses in individuals with GD. People with GD showed lower prefrontal activity during the Stroop test compared with healthy controls (HC). GD was associated with both an altered inhibition of impulsive actions and an inadequate ability to delay gratification (impulsive choice) [ ], as supported by a number of studies using delay discounting tasks. Delay discounting is an indicator of an individual\u2019s preference for immediate and minor rewards, rather than greater but delayed rewards; it also allows an assessment of the inability to delay rewards. Indeed, an interesting study by Clark and colleagues [ ] investigated the possible neuropsychological mechanisms underlying GD, analyzing the \u201cnear-miss\u201d trials, in which failures occurred close to the jackpot, thus resulting in an increased desire to play. In a streamlined slot machine scenario, the near winnings were experienced as less pleasant and increased the desire to play compared to full losses. This effect emerged more markedly when the individual actively controlled the bet, supporting the idea that near wins would strengthen the aspects of GD correlated to the desire to play by involving the reward circuit in an anomalous way. \n\nLikewise, patients with AUD have shown a compromised inhibitory process. The effects of alcohol on the brain are different: with low doses, it activates the pleasure areas linked to the release of endorphins; with increasing doses, however, alcohol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system [ ]. In particular, it inhibits the function of one of the excitatory neurotransmitters, namely, glutamate, thus slowing down brain activity [ ]. The main effects of this inhibition are learning deficits, altered judgment, and lowered levels of self-control [ , ]. Consequently, those who are intoxicated by alcohol often fail to properly assess their abilities. Overall, AUD leads to a progressive loss of judgment and a progressive deterioration of the personality, related to the organic brain damage produced by alcohol [ , ]. This deterioration of personality is manifested by an accentuation of traits, lack of attention and will, loss of interest, emotional disturbances, mood liability, wayward social behavior, reductions in capacity and judgment, and memory loss [ ]. The impairment of all these functions can lead to alcoholic dementia [ , ]. Brain damage also occurs in the medium\/long term and yields deficits in attentional processes, executive functions, problem solving, decision-making, working memory, and long-term memory [ ]. Alcoholic brain damage seems to be partially reversible in some cases, although organic brain damage often remains permanent [ , ]. The neuropsychological consequences of AUD inevitably include a reduced control of behavior and the suppression of psychosocial adaptability skills [ ]. Patients with AUD were found to show higher levels of impulsive choice than controls in a delay discounting task; also, higher delay discounting rates were markedly correlated with greater impulsivity trait scores [ ]. With regard to delayed decisions, impulsive choices were specifically correlated with higher activity in systems involved in reward processing and monetary evaluation [ ]. Abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals showed a greater activity than HC during \u201csooner-but-smaller\u201d rewards [ ]. Lim and colleagues [ ] examined whether the severity of AUD was associated with discounting rates on delay discounting tasks, and found that individuals with more severe AUD showed higher discounting rates\u2014namely, a higher tendency to prefer \u201csooner-but-smaller\u201d to \u201clater-but-larger\u201d rewards. It has also been observed that the performance of individuals with AUD in tasks that use alcohol contextual cues is worse than that of HC [ ]. In go\/no-go tasks, patients with AUD showed worse performances than controls (both in accuracy and reaction times) during the presentation of alcohol-related images [ ]. The alcoholic context may therefore induce a further worsening of the response inhibition deficit in patients with AUD, putting these subjects at risk of making habitual, unwanted responses and relapsing. Decision-making assessed by means of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was worse in patients with AUD, especially during \u201cadapt\u2014choice\u201d behavior; in contrast with HC, patients made a shift in their decisions to disadvantageous cards during the last trials, especially in the last block [ ]. \n\n\n## 3. Neurobiological and Neurofunctional Alterations in GD and AUD \n  \nDifferent fMRI studies have analyzed neurofunctional alterations in decision-making processes in individuals with GD. In three studies, the Iowa Gambling Task was used [ , , ], while three other studies evaluated the decision-making process within a semi-realistic blackjack scenario [ ], a card-deck paradigm [ ], and a probabilistic gambling scenario [ ]. Decreased activity in the ventro medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and in striatal regions of GD individuals has been reported, likely reflecting an orientation to riskier decisions in response to monetary rewards, especially during deck selection [ , , , ]. These functional alterations may reflect the poorer performances on the IGT reported above in the \u201cNeuropsychological features of GD and AUD\u201d section, and could lead to decreased contextual learning or decreased sensitivity to monetary punishment correlated with hippocampal and amygdala deactivation [ ]. On the other hand, Tanabe and colleagues [ ] found a greater reduction in the vmPFC activity in patients with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and GD comorbidities. This result suggested a relative preservation of vmPFC function in individuals with GD, in contradiction to prior fMRI studies. Scores on the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) were found to be correlated with the ventral striatum (VS, including nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle) activity in individuals with GD [ ]. Using an adapted version of the card-deck paradigm, Brevers and colleagues [ ] found that patients with GD showed decreased activation in the right globus pallidus during risky decision-making relative to ambiguous decision-making; nonetheless, greater neural activity within the putamen before risky choices than safe choices was reported. \n\nFurthermore, in contrast to HC, patients with GD showed greater activation in the right putamen before high risk choices than before safe choices. Gelskov and colleagues [ ] found that, despite similar behavioral performances in individuals with GD and HC (i.e., a similar number of errors in both groups), patients with GD showed greater neural sensitivity in the dorsal cortico-striatal network to the most appetitive and aversive gain\u2013loss ratios. Miedl and colleagues [ ], using a delay discounting task, found that those with GD (who showed higher discounting rates) showed an altered functionality in the reward network involving the OFC\/VS, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the VTA. Moreover, the degree of the correlations between the subjective representation of the value and the activity in these areas during the \u201cdelay discounting\u201d was directly proportional to the severity of the gambling [ ]. Concerning AUD, excessive exposure to the effects of alcohol affects the transmission of signals underlying adaptive learning behavior, assessed in different learning tasks, such as goal-directed vs. habitual learning and instrumental learning [ , ], with an increase in prediction errors, which has been associated with weaker activation of the vmPFC and with an altered connectivity between vs. and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [ , , ]. This functional alteration has been hypothesized to be associated with a shift from goal-directed actions to habitual actions that, in turn, could reinforce compulsive alcohol consumption and recurrent relapses [ , , ]. Decreased activity in the vs. has frequently been reported in alcohol-dependent individuals and has often been correlated with the severity of craving, impulsiveness and depressive symptoms [ , ]. However, some studies have reported controversial results, showing an increase in ventral and dorsal striatum activity during tasks of winning or losing anticipation [ ], which suggested an impairment in the computation of expected values. A study used a card-guessing task [ ] to observe the differences in coding on the expected value of winnings and losses, distinguishing the effects of probability and magnitude of the results: in individuals with AUD, a more pronounced neural response in the left caudate nucleus (CN) was present during the anticipation of winning and in the left CN and left putamen in relation to the magnitude of the results. A general imbalance in the conflict-monitoring brain circuitry underlying decision-making under risk has been described in AUD: specifically, patients with AUD showed enhanced anticipatory activity in neural circuitries of executive and motor control, encompassing the insula (INS), the ACC and the basal ganglia [ , , ]. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that the dorso lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may be particularly hyperactive in individuals with AUD during delayed and cognitively difficult decisions [ ]. This activity is associated with cognitive control, suggesting that patients with AUD recruit these brain regions to a greater extent when they make the delayed choice [ , ]. Additionally, brain areas in the parietal and occipital lobes, including the precuneus, angular gyrus and occipital cortex, were more activated during impulsive decisions than delayed choices [ , ]. These regions have been widely reported in the delay discounting literature [ ] and are involved in spatially directed attention, multisensory perception and visual processing [ ]. McClure and colleagues [ , ] suggested the presence of two separate systems for immediate evaluations and delayed rewards: parts of the limbic system associated with the midbrain dopamine system, including the paralimbic cortex, are preferably driven by decisions involving immediately available rewards, and in contrast, the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex are engaged by intertemporal choices irrespective of delay. \n\n\n## 4. Methods \n  \n### 4.1. Inclusion Criteria for Papers \n  \nWe used a systematic approach to review the literature and select appropriate articles for the present meta-analysis. The search for relevant literature was performed using PubMed and Web of Knowledge (Web of Science); the data included in this meta-analysis have been collected from early 2019 to February 2020 and the search was run simultaneously on these databases, using the following keywords and their combinations: fMRI AND \u201cGambling\u201d OR \u201cAlcohol\u201d AND \u201cDecision Making\u201d, AND \u201cGambling disorder\u201d, OR \u201cAlcohol Abuse Disorder\u201d, OR \u201cMRI\u201d, OR \u201cFunctional MRI\u201d. This search produced 2461 papers. There were 2152 total records remaining after the duplicates were removed. \n\nThese articles were then screened according to our a priori inclusion criteria for papers, which were as follows: (1) whole-brain activity analysis performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); thus, we excluded positron emission tomography (PET) studies and excluded papers reporting only results from region of interest (ROI) analyses; (2) the coordinates of the activation foci were provided either in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach [ ] reference space; the participants included (3) adults who fulfilled the criteria for AUD or GD\u2014hereafter called Groups\u2014without comorbidity or dependence on other substances and (4) HC as a reference for the contrast studies; and (5) the experimental task required participants to perform a decision-making task or similar tasks that engage decisional processes. Studies were included if they met the above inclusion criteria. We followed the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement [ , ]. Independent double-checking was used to avoid the biases in the data extraction. Differently from the effect-size meta-analysis, the neuroimaging meta-analysis allowed us to test for the spatial convergence of effects across experiments [ ]. Moreover, the strict inclusion criteria of the study defined at the beginning allowed us to check and control for some of these biases. In addition, the same independent investigators have provided the correctness of the space (MNI or Talairach) and the coordinates. Using these criteria, we selected 34 peer-reviewed journal articles (these studies are summarized in   and  ). \n\nThe flowchart of article selection is shown in  . Further details about the study classification are reported below in the \u201cActivation Likelihood Estimation\u201d section. \n\n\n### 4.2. Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nThe meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach [ , , ]; ALE is one of the most commonly used techniques for the coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data and is found in the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ). It is a powerful tool to integrate the neuroimaging literature where relevant regions of activations are identified across a series of studies. Specifically, peak coordinates are obtained from studies that share a common feature of interest, such as specific tasks or processes. The ALE algorithm has been applied in many aspects of normal brain function [ , , ], as well as in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders [ , ]. A central feature of the ALE algorithm is to model the coordinates given as the centroids of Gaussian 3-D probability distribution [ ], thus embracing the spatial uncertainty of neuroimaging results caused by interindividual neuroanatomical variability and the limits of the signal-noise and spatial resolution of neuroimaging methods. Other algorithms for the meta-analysis of fMRI data do exist\u2014for example, the traditional meta-analysis on mean %BOLD signal change within region of interest (ROI) or Intensity-Based Meta-Analysis (IBMA) on the activation map. However, the former may be affected by different strategies used to identify the ROI in different studies (e.g., atlas-based ROI, using an independent localizer scan, and individual or group ROI); instead, the latter inevitably restricts the number of studies to be included in the meta-analysis, because activation maps are provided very rarely. Thus, a coordinate-based meta-analysis, such as the ALE meta-analysis, offers a good tool to summarize previous findings and generate new hypotheses [ ]. \n\nThe Talairach coordinates of the studies included in the ALE meta-analysis were automatically converted into MNI coordinates using GingerALE. According to the modified procedures of Eickhoff and colleagues [ ], the ALE values of each voxel in the brain were computed, and the null distribution of the ALE statistic was calculated for each voxel. The ALE method incorporates a variable uncertainty based on subject size. Since implementing the variable uncertainty of the random-effects method, GingerALE needs subject information for each foci group to calculate the Full-Width Half-Maximum(FWHM) of the Gaussian function used to blur the foci [ ]. The thresholded ALE map was computed using p values from the previous phase, and we used a cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 Familywise Error (FWE)corrected [ ]. For each group (GD and AUD) activation (activation and deactivation), we performed separate ALE meta-analyses (  and  ). \n\n\n\n## 5. Results \n  \n### 5.1. Neural Alterations in Gambling Disorder \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis on GD ( ) revealed clusters of activation in both hemispheres ( ), mainly located in the head and body of the cuneus (CN;  ), in the lentiform nucleus (LN), and in the hypothalamus (see  ). We also found clusters of activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and in the right putamen. No significant suprathreshold cluster of deactivation was detected in GD. \n\n\n### 5.2. Neural Alterations in Alcohol Use Disorder \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis on AUD (  and  ) revealed clusters of activation in the lentiform nucleus (LN) including the superior portion of the left putamen ( ). We also found clusters of activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus. The ALE meta-analysis revealed clusters of deactivation in both hemispheres located in the MFG, and also the boundary between the middle and anterior portion of the left cingulate gyrus cortex (CGC) and the inferior portion of the left putamen ( ). \n\n\n\n## 6. Discussion \n  \nExecutive functions encompass several cognitive processes, such as decision-making, response inhibition, conflict monitoring, cognitive flexibility, and their possible relationship with reward-related decision-making processes [ ]. Executive functions have been repeatedly found to be altered in GD and AUD (see the \u201cIntroduction\u201d section above). There are multiple reliable and valid computerized neurocognitive tasks used during fMRI scanning to assess neurofunctional alterations in GD and AUD; by including these tasks in our meta-analysis (see   and  ) and summarizing previous fMRI findings on AUD and GD, we demonstrated neurofunctional alterations in the brain network of executive control in individuals with AUD and GD. The present meta-analysis and results, going beyond the limitations of a single-study approach (e.g., low power and generalizability), provide, for the first time, broad and converging evidence that both disorders are associated with specific neural alterations in neural networks related to executive function. For ease of exposition, the discussion will be divided into subheadings. \n\n### 6.1. Neurofunctional Alterations in the Executive Function Brain Network in GD \n  \nOur results revealed clusters of abnormal activation in GD bilaterally in the head and the body of the CN, in the right LN (including the putamen), and the right MFG. These results are in accordance with previous studies [ , , , , ]. Individuals with GD, relative to HC, also showed increased activity in the left dorsal ACC. The brain reward system is crucial to survival by stimulating food consumption, social bonding, or reproduction through the release of dopamine in the NAc and frontal lobes. Our findings support the idea that some regions, such as the vs. and its afferent and efferent projections, are pathologically involved in \u201cunnatural rewards\u201d, leading to compulsive activities such as gambling, as occurs also for other types of addictions such as alcohol and nicotine [ ]. \n\nThe striatum has been widely reported to be involved in the subjectively discounted value of delayed rewards and in the anticipation of monetary rewards [ , , , ]. Indeed, individuals with GD showed greater activity in the bilateral dorsal striatum, linked to stronger action\u2013outcome associations [ ], which could be explained by an overestimation of the gambling outcomes. The hyperactivity of these regions appears to be associated with higher reward-seeking behavior, which could be a compensatory mechanism correlated to reward gaps in GD [ ]. Instead, the vs. seems to be more involved in the processing of rewards per se [ ]. The present findings showed higher activation in the LN during tasks engaging executive functions in individuals with GD, consistent with the idea that GD is a behavioral dependence associated with dysfunction in the reward circuit. The fronto-striatal cortical circuit (encompassing the right lenticular nucleus and the MFG) plays a pivotal role in executive functioning [ ] and inhibitory control [ ], including reward, control, and motor planning [ ]. When the clinical syndromes are more severe, with higher SOGS scores, the patients with GD fail to regulate their gambling behavior due to the hyperactivity of the striatum. Thus, the functional alteration we detected here may contribute to fronto-striatal dysfunction in GD, which in turn results in abnormal self-regulation and the intense desire of gamblers to maximize the reward.  \n\nIn this vein, GD may arise from the imbalance between the dopaminergic system, including limbic motivational areas and neural pathways connecting the frontal lobe regions with the basal ganglia (fronto-striatal circuits), which results in impaired cognitive control, leading to progressive loss of control over gambling behaviors [ ]. \n\n\n### 6.2. Neurofunctional Alterations in the Executive Function Brain Network in AUD \n  \nThe present results revealed three clusters of activation in individuals with AUD, mainly located in the PCC extending to the precuneus, in the right MFG, and in the left putamen. The highest activation we detected in the left putamen may have been related to the computed value and\/or hedonic elements of making an enhanced risky choice as monetary earnings in individuals with AUD. These areas receive both glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs and have been involved in developing and maintaining alcohol dependence, consistent with behavioral evidence that alcohol-dependent individuals show a greater sensitivity to earning experiences in support of the future risky search for a reward. The greater activation we found in the occipital areas might be explained by the fact that those with AUD needed to recruit more resources in the visual area to inhibit processing of alcohol-related pictures [ ]. We also found clusters of deactivation in the bilateral MFG, the cingulate cortex, and the left putamen. All of these areas work together and are involved in cognitive control, error processing, impulse control, and decision-making processes. Our results suggested that individuals with AUD have difficulties in adapting their responses to the changing contingencies of reward-guided decision-making. Weaker activity in the bilateral DLPFC and the dorsal anterior cingulate, associated with loss of adaptive control of action selection, could be linked with cognitive inflexibility when reinforcement contingencies change [ ]. In Wrase and colleagues [ ], individuals with AUD showed weaker sensitivity in the putamen and in the caudate head during the anticipation of monetary gain. Moreover, activity in the nucleus caudate was implicated in linking the reward to behavior and could be associated with an increased learning benefit from a reward in the HC [ ]. \n\n\n### 6.3. Evidence for the Neurobiological Hypothesis of AUD and GD \n  \nThe most accredited neurobiological hypothesis for addictive behavior is dysfunction in the \u201ccortico-striatal reward pathway\u201d, which includes areas such as the vs. and mPFC [ ]. fMRI studies do not clarify the nature and direction of this dysfunction, with a number of studies showing activations and an almost equal number showing deactivations [ , ]. The converging evidence for activation in GD that we found here is in line with two seminal theories: the \u201cincentive sensitization theory\u201d and the \u201cimpulsivity theory\u201d. The incentive sensitization theory posits an attentional bias towards cues related to addiction, thereby exacerbating compulsive pathological features [ ]. This leads to an abnormal recruitment of the reward system, which results in a greater activation of the VS, especially when, as in GD, the reward is monetary. When incentive sensitization is combined with altered executive control, uncontrolled impulsiveness and sensation seeking, it can lead the individual to dependent behavior such as that observed in GD. \n\nOur results also provide converging evidence for the deactivation in AUD of different brain circuits, including areas of the mPFC, the superolateral prefrontal cortex (sPFC), the ACC, and the striatum. These results are consistent with the theory of reward deficiency syndrome (\u201cRDS\u201d) [ ], which highlights a general and chronic deactivation of reward circuits that reduces the pleasure of the gratification experience. These deactivated brain areas (striatum and mPFC), operating in a dysfunctional way, generate deficits in the monitoring of anticipation, expectancy, salience of rewards, and decision-making processes [ ]. \n\n\n### 6.4. Conclusions and Future Directions \n  \nHere, we detected interesting findings about the direction of functional alterations in individuals with AUD and GD that have not been previously described. We found that GD was mainly associated with the higher activation of the fronto-striatal circuit (including the basal ganglia, MFG, and ACC). In contrast, AUD was associated with the higher activation of the occipital cortex and of the superior portion of the putamen, as well as with the deactivation of the fronto-striatal network (including the MFG, MCC, and inferior portion of the putamen). Thus, GD seems to be associated with an activation of the reward network, whereas AUD seems to be associated with both the deactivation and activation of the different nodes of this circuit. The direct comparison between the two conditions (namely, AUD and GD) is currently unfeasible due to the paucity of the studies meeting the inclusion criteria for an ALE meta-analysis. In addition, the state of the literature does not allow a clear distinction between the different executive processes involved, just as it is not possible to determine which is the most appropriate task to measure them. For such a reason, it has not been possible to distinguish between different sub-processes of the executive functions, because often the available studies do not describe what aspect of the executive functions has been investigated. This is due to the paucity of studies, and it represents both a limitation of the present study and the current modelling of executive function itself. Future studies should clarify and shed light on which aspects of the executive functions are really lacking in GD and AUD. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7348890,"text_md5":"a4c3e71a2776e0b9c02aeb47152c6fdc","field_positions":{"authors":[0,130],"journal":[131,140],"publication_year":[142,146],"title":[157,306],"keywords":[320,432],"abstract":[445,1734],"body":[1743,36500]},"batch":1,"pmid":32517334,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci10060353","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7348890","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7348890"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7348890\">7348890<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7348890  Brain Network Underlying Executive Functions in Gambling and Alcohol Use Disorders: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies"}

We used PubMed to retrieve task\/resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry studies. Stereotactic data were extracted from fifteen studies, and subsequently tested for convergence using activation likelihood estimation. We found convergent evidence for structural atrophy and functional disturbances in the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and the right central insula. Functional characterization of these regions using the BrainMap database suggested associated dysfunction of emotional, sensory, and limbic processes. Assessment of task-based co-activation patterns furthermore indicated that the two regions obtained from the meta-analysis are part of a joint network comprising the anterior insula, posterior-medial frontal cortex and thalamus. Taken together, our findings highlight the role of right amygdala, hippocampus and insula in the abnormal emotional and sensory processing in OSA. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic disorder that arises from recurrent partial or complete pharyngeal obstruction during sleep ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In patients with OSA, this leads to nocturnal apneas and hypopneas, intermittent hypoxia, reoxygenation and hyper-\/hypocapnia events, along with sleep fragmentation, and changes in cerebral blood flow ( ,  ,  ). The prevalence of OSA is noticeable in general population and around 50% in patients with cardiovascular or metabolic disorders ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nSeveral recent studies highlighted that OSA contributes to emotional and cognitive decline, and it is increasingly considered as one of the rare modifiable risk factors for neurodegenerative dementia ( ,  ,  ,  ). If untreated, OSA can result in varying degrees of cognitive deficits such as difficulties with attention, memory, executive functioning, and quality of life ( ,  ). In addition, excessive daytime sleepiness, labile interpersonal relationships, and decreased work and school efficiency have all been documented in OSA patients ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, it is recognized that OSA patients are two to thirteen times more likely to experience a driving-related traffic accident ( ,  ,  ,  ). Such accidents are more likely to occur in those who manifest greater daytime sleepiness, but are not necessarily related to sleepiness alone ( ,  ). In addition to cognitive and emotional deficits, increased prevalence of OSA in several psychiatric disorders has been reported, of which major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appear best documented ( ,  ). \n\nIt has been suggested that adaptive and maladaptive processes both occur in patients with OSA in response to hypoxemia ( ). The fine balance of these processes, and its eventual impact on neurocognitive and emotional performance, will depend on the stage of this dynamic process, effects on other organ systems, cognitive reserve, and idiosyncratic susceptibility ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Although these deficits are not always reversed with treatment ( ), a meta-analysis ( ) and a meta-review ( ) suggest beneficial effects of treatment (e.g. continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) on cognitive performance, sleepiness and neural injury in patients with OSA. \n\nOver the last three decades, numerous structural and functional neuroimaging studies, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) have been conducted on patients with OSA. Structural and functional MRI imaging studies, however, often point to diverse results in OSA ( ,  ). The variability of the findings has been suggested to be due to relatively small sample sizes, with heterogeneous patient groups that differed in several key respects (e.g. diagnostic criteria, IQ, age, gender, and the imaging acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis methods); for more detailed discussion, please refer to ( ,  ,  ). To date, OSA structural studies have used a spatially unbiased analytical approach, such as commonly used mass-univariate approaches that rely on conservative statistical thresholds mandated by the large number of voxels compared between-groups ( ). On the other hand, task fMRI studies used a variety of paradigms to study functional disturbances in particular disease. Recently, the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method has been proposed as a useful methodology that, using coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), provides a powerful tool to attain a synoptic view of distributed neuroimaging findings and different neuroimaging methods (e.g. structural and functional) in an objective and quantitative fashion ( ,  ). More specifically, CBMA method searches for \u201cwhere\u201d in the brain the amount of convergence between reported foci is more than expected by chance, which yields to statistical inference on the integration of previous findings ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOnly structural OSA studies were hitherto analysed using the ALE method ( ), and in order to fully address some of the previously raised concerns in the field about the diversity of these findings, we undertook the ALE meta-analysis of both functional and structural abnormalities recorded in patients with OSA. Our aim was to elucidate converging findings and to emphasize important brain nodes as highlighted via different neuroimaging modalities. We then functionally characterized the obtained regions that showed neurobiological aberrations in OSA patients by means of the BrainMap database, and also assessed their brain wide co-activation patterns to reveal networks that are (conjointly) connected to these obtained areas. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategies and study selection \n  \nIn accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement ( ), references for this meta-analysis were collected by a search of the PubMed database in April 2015, and by reference tracing of retrieved articles. Keywords for the search were as follows: (i) ((\u201cSleep Apnea Syndromes\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSleep Apnea; Central\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSleep Apnea; Obstructive\u201d[Mesh]) OR sleep apnea) AND ((\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d) OR \u201cfMRI\u201d); which resulted in 45 studies; (ii) (\u201cSleep Apnea Syndromes\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSleep Apnea; Central\u201d[Mesh] OR \u201cSleep Apnea; Obstructive\u201d[Mesh]) OR sleep apnea AND ((\u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d) OR \u201cVBM\u201d) that resulted in 21 studies ( ). No positron emission tomography (PET) studies met our criteria. Of note is that here; \u201cstudy\u201d reflects an individual scientific paper and \u201cexperiment\u201d represents a single analysis or contrast of interest in a given study yielding localization information (i.e. OSA>controls; OSA<controls). \n\nOnly peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies that were published in English language and that compared groups of human adult OSA patients (above 18 years old) to healthy controls were included. The exclusion criteria were as follows:   \nCase-reports, letter to editors, meta-analysis or review studies reporting no original data. \n  \nStudies that did not report whole-brain analysis. \n  \nStudies which did not report standard space coordinates. \n  \nStudies that reported coordinates only in sub-sample. \n  \nIntervention studies (pre\/post treatment contrasts such as CPAP). \n  \nStudies without a \u201ccontrol group\u201d i.e. those focused only on a group of OSA patients. \n  \nStudies where less than 7 patients were included in each group. \n  \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nTwo investigators independently extracted the information (M.T and A.A.S). Recorded data included the first author\u2019s name, year of publication, age, gender and number of patients and controls, the imaging modality (resting-state\/task fMRI or VBM) and type of task in the task fMRI studies. Moreover, we recorded the peak coordinates (x,y,z) in Talairach ( ) or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) ( ) stereotactic space from all experiments and transformed all data into MNI coordinates for analysis ( ). We used the extracted stereotactic coordinates to conduct the ALE meta-analysis. \n\nIf a publication did not report the coordinates of activation maxima, we contacted the authors. Two studies were excluded ( ,  ) because the authors published two papers based on the same samples i.e. ( ,  ,  ,  ). It is worthy to note that one study performed both VBM and rs-fMRI measurements ( ) and another one applied both VBM and task fMRI ( ) ( ). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nThe statistical analyses were performed using the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) ( ) based on coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA) ( ,  ,  ). ALE assessed the significant convergence between activation foci from different experiments (e.g. OSA>controls, OSA<controls) for a given study in comparison with a random distribution of foci. More specifically, as the first step, ALE algorithm models the reported foci as center peaks of 3D Gaussian probability distributions that acknowledge the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus. The uncertainty is mainly due to between-subject variations (neuroanatomical variability and small sample sizes) and between-laboratory differences (various brain templates, normalization, and analysis strategies). The number of participants per experiment determines the width of the spatial uncertainty of any focus ( ). As the second step, the probability distributions of all activation foci in a particular experiment are combined for each voxel, which creates a modeled activation map (MA map). Thus, these MA maps summarize localization probabilities of studies and the final ALE map results from interpolation of these MA maps describing the convergence of results across all experiments. During the third step, an analytical approach based on a non-linear histogram integration is applied to test against the null hypothesis of randomly distributed foci and subsequently significant statistical threshold set at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 family-wise error in cluster level (cFWE). The recent analysis approach tested for convergence by experiments (random effects) rather than foci (fixed effects) ( ); for further details and a summary of the ALE method please refer to ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Functional decoding using the BrainMap database \n  \nTo assess the functional roles of the abnormal brain regions in OSA, behavioral decoding using the BrainMap database was consequently performed. More specifically, we tested which types of tasks were more likely than chance to activate for each of the meta-analysis common regional gray matter loss and functional abnormalities (or seeds) ( ,  ,  ). The behavioral domain and paradigm class meta-data categories from the BrainMap database were used for functional characterization of the clusters. At the time of analysis, the database included coordinates of reported activation foci and associated meta-data of more than 10,000 neuroimaging experiments ( ,  ,  ). Behavioral domains of the BrainMap database consist of several main categories including cognition, action, perception, emotion, and interoception, and their related sub-categories, which define the neural processes isolated by the respective contrast. However, paradigm classes specify the particular applied task ( ) (see  ). For the functional characterization of common regional atrophy and functional abnormalities, all experiments in the BrainMap database that featured at least one focus of activation within the seed regions were determined based on reported activation coordinates. Subsequently, for each behavioral domain and paradigm class category, we identified regional functional profile by discerning taxonomic labels for which the probability of finding activation in the respective cluster is significantly higher than the overall chance across the entire BrainMap database. Significant level was identified as p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 using a binomial test ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Whole-brain co-activation profiles \n  \nIn order to map brain regions that feature significant co-activation with the regions identified in the OSA structural and functional meta-analysis, we performed meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM). More specifically, we tested how likely it is that the experiments activating the particular region also activate other brain voxels above chance ( ,  ). In order to perform MACM, first we identified all experiments in the BrainMap database that activate the convergent seeds. Then, quantitative meta-analysis was applied to test for convergence across the foci reported in the experiments. Inevitably, the highest convergence will be observed in the seed regions because experiments are already selected by activation in those seeds. Significant convergence of reported foci in other brain areas represents consistent co-activation or functional connectivity of other voxels with the seeds. More specifically, MACM provides information on the functional interactions of cortical modules based on their whole-brain co-activation pattern across the BrainMap database ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFifteen publications that recruited 290 OSA patients and 290 healthy controls were included ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) ( ,  ). These publications collectively reported results from 30 experiments; of which 17 experiments were reported as the \u201cOSA<controls\u201d contrasts and 13 experiments for the \u201cOSA>controls\u201d contrasts. \n\n### Convergence of neuroimaging findings in OSA \n  \nTesting for significant convergence across all eligible neuroimaging experiments comparing subjects with OSA to healthy controls yielded two significant clusters, one located in the right amygdala\/hippocampus, the other in the right central insula (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE corrected in cluster level) ( ). \n\nThe cluster of convergence in the right amygdala\/hippocampus was driven by a 62.5% contribution from task-fMRI studies (cognitive stimulation paradigms contributed 35% and sensory stimulation paradigms contributed 27.5%). Further 37.5% of contribution was driven by VBM studies. No contribution from resting-state fMRI was noted. The identified shared cluster of reduced grey matter volume and functional hypo-activation in OSA patients (local maximum: 22\/-10\/-22 in MNI space) was then anatomically allocated to the internal subdivision of the human right amygdala and hippocampus, as defined by histological ( ) and functional ( ,  ,  ,  ) criteria using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox ( ). Majority of the cluster volume (31%) appeared assigned to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, with smaller portions extending into the CA1 (14%), CA3 (13%), and subiculum (9%) ( A). A second cluster of significant convergence was located in the right central insula (local maximum: 40\/2\/-4 in MNI space) ( ,  ). This result was almost completely driven by the hypo-activations in task-fMRI studies (99.9%). Among those, cognitive stimulation paradigms contributed 55.4% and sensory stimulation paradigms contributed 44.5% to the right central insula ( B). \n\nSupplementary analyses targeting convergence among specific aspects confirmed these key findings. We then tested for significant convergence across the functional MRI findings, pooling across task- and resting-state fMRI analyses in order to provide a global assessment of aberrant functional patterns in OSA patients. Accounting for multiple comparisons across the entire brain, a significant convergence was again identified in the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula. Subsequently, we sub-analysed only task-based fMRI studies, identifying the same regions as significant. Due to the low number of available experiments, resting-state functional imaging findings could not be reliable assessed in isolation at this point. \n\nIn summary, the performed series of quantitative meta-analyses on structural and functional neuroimaging findings in OSA patients revealed consistent evidence for primarily structural atrophy and functional disturbances (task-related hypo-activations) in the right amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula. \n\n\n\n## Functional decoding using the BrainMap database \n  \nIn order to assess the functional roles of these two brain regions, which feature the most consistent evidence for OSA-related aberrations, we performed behavioral decoding using the BrainMap database. More precisely, we tested which types of tasks were more likely than by chance to activate the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula regions identified in the main ALE analysis. We found a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) association of the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus region with affective and emotional processing, perception\/interoception, memory-related processes, somatosensory functions ( A). The cluster located on the right central insular cortex was reported as associated with somatosensory processing, and in particular with pain processing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) ( B). \n\nIn summary, the behavioral decoding of the two identified regions via BrainMap functional database indicates their previous significant association with sensory and phylogenetic older limbic processes. \n\n### Whole-brain co-activation profiles \n  \nAs our next step and in order to map brain regions that feature significant co-activation with the two identified regions, we performed MACM. In first instance, those experiments in BrainMap that feature activation in the region of the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and the right central insula were identified. Those regions that were more likely than by chance to be co-recruited with these seeds and may hence be considered as a part of the functionally connected networks, were then further investigated by an ALE meta-analysis across identified experiments. \n\nThe MACM analysis indicated significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE corrected in cluster level) co-activation of the right amygdala\/hippocampus region with several bilateral brain regions. In particular, co-activations were found with the left amygdala\/hippocampus ( ,  ,  ), medial prefrontal (area FP2 ( )), anterior cingulate cortex (areas s24 and s32 ( )), posterior-medial frontal cortex ( ), and bilateral mid-fusiform gyrus (presumably corresponding to the fusiform face region) ( ). We also found significant co-activation with the bilateral thalamus (e.g. mediodorsal and anterior nuclei projecting to the prefrontal cortex and the ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei shown to project to motor and premotor cortices ( )). In addition the anterior insula and adjacent ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) ( ), as well as precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ( ) were identified bilaterally ( A). \n\nSignificant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cFWE corrected) co-activation of the right central insula was largely symmetrically across both hemispheres. Co-activated regions comprised the bilateral parietal operculum (areas OP 1 and OP 4) ( ,  ) and adjacent inferior parietal cortex (areas PFop and PFcm ( )), bilateral thalamus ( ) and posterior-medial frontal cortex ( ). We also found significant co-activation with the bilateral ventral striatum and the basal forebrain. Finally, co-activated regions comprised the entire insula and perisylvian cortex including the adjacent ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex ( ,  ,  ) ( B). \n\nAs the last step, we analysed the concurrence activations across both MACM analyses in order to identify regions that feature significant task-based co-activation with both seeds (right amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula). This analysis revealed the bilateral anterior insula and left opercular area OP 1, bilateral thalamus, as well as posterior-medial frontal cortex ( A). Assessing the functions significantly associated with this entire network through behavioral characterization using the BrainMap database similarly suggested a strong connection with perception and somatosensory processing ( B). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIt has been suggested that the diverse and often conflicting findings regarding brain structure and function in a variety of disorders may be ameliorated by a more finely tuned understanding of which structures in networks are most implicated ( ,  ). In this vein, in our study, we have undertaken to gain greater understanding of core features of regional volume and activity alteration in patients with OSA across the published literature by using the ALE meta-analysis of currently available functional and structural imaging studies. This has been done with view to address the impact of diffuse changes in important areas on emotions, sensory and cognition impairments in patients with OSA. \n\nIn our study, the combined ALE quantitative analyses on group contrasts between patients with OSA and healthy controls highlighted structural atrophy and functional disturbances (task-related hypo-activations) in the clusters corresponding to the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and the right central insula ( ). These highlighted regions, the amygdala\/hippocampus and the insular cortex, have so far been relatively neglected nodes in the OSA neurocircuitry fingerprint. The likely contribution of these structures to recognized deficits and disabilities in OSA is hence explored here further. Behavioral decoding analyses of these two regions demonstrated the possible dysfunction of emotional, sensory, and cognitive processes ( ). The results of MACM analysis inferred that the right basolateral amygdala\/hippocampus and central insula also comprise a network with the bilateral anterior insula, posterior-medial frontal cortex and thalamus ( ,  ). \n\n### Amygdala\/hippocampus \u2018node\u2019 and OSA \n  \nConvergent functional and structural alteration in the right basolateral amygdala and the CA1\/CA3 regions of hippocampus and the subiculum ( A) in our results appears to have been driven by contribution of both structural and functional neuroimaging. \n\n#### Basolateral nucleus of amygdala \n  \nIt has been posited that one of the functions of the amygdala is to link sensory input to emotional responses that then guide behavior ( ). Aberrant facial emotions processing, emotional blunting and even aberrant sexual behaviors, dysfunctional memory and olfactory processing ( ), have all been reported with damage to amygdala ( ,  ). Apart from the emotional processing, it has also been shown that basolateral nucleus of amygdala is involved in spatial and motor learning ( ). The majority of listed deficits have also been reported to a smaller or larger degree in patients with OSA ( ,  ). \n\nThe importance of amygdala as one of structures affected by the chronic process of OSA has been previously intimated by several studies ( ,  ,  ). For instance, in children with OSA, during watching empathy-eliciting scenarios, the severity of OSA predicted less sensitivity to harm in the left amygdala ( ). In general, a greater neural recruitment of regions implicated in cognitive control, conflict monitoring, and attentional allocation has been required in those children with OSA in order to perform at the same level as children without OSA ( ). The results of our meta-analysis may go some way to explain an aberrant facial cues processing previously noted in children. Namely, our findings implicated the co-activation of nominally important regions and circuitry for this processing, e.g. the right amygdala region co-activation with the mid-fusiform gyrus, corresponding to the face region, and the anterior hippocampus, ventral striatum, contralateral amygdala, and the contralateral prefrontal cortex was found ( A). Of all nuclei, the basolateral nucleus of amygdala appeared most affected according to the pooled results of the meta-analysis ( A). \n\nPreclinical investigations of the amygdala connectivity suggest that the basolateral amygdala receives sensory information from the thalamus, hippocampus and cortex and then activates or modulates synaptic transmission in target areas appropriate for the reinforcement signal with which the sensory information has been associated ( ). In animals, amygdala has been shown as vital for learning procedures and stress-induced conditioning that involves pairings of potent and arbitrary chemosensory stimuli ( ). For example, an animal study demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing factor receptors within the basolateral amygdala are involved in regulating fear-conditioned alterations in sleep ( ). \n\nSimilarly, and in keeping with these studies behavioral decoding of the regions highlighted by our meta-analysis suggested a significant association with affective and emotional processing, memory-related processes, and chemo-sensory processing ( A). \n\nMoreover, it has been suggested that the role of the amygdala in modulating momentary levels of vigilance in response to uncertainty underscores its likely importance for the etiology of anxiety disorders, MDD and PTSD ( ,  ,  ). The increased prevalence of these psychopathologies has been recognized in patients with OSA, possibly also suggesting a dual relationship. A meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies in PTSD and anxiety patients has suggested the basal portion of the amygdala as the major focus of hyperactivity ( ), the same part of amygdala suggested by findings of our meta-analysis ( A). \n\nRecent evidence further suggests that the amygdala is part of a complex network that mediates the formation of a larger repertoire of positive and negative emotions and it\u2019s dysfunctions may lead to various psychiatric disorders ( ). The pivotal role for the basolateral amygdala in differentiation of stimuli, and subsequent prediction of either positive or negative outcomes, has been suggested ( ). Specifically, it has been shown that synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala mediates the acquisition of associative memories of both end of emotional valences, and that different populations of neurons of that complex may encode fearful or rewarding associations ( ). For example, it appears that basolateral nucleus neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens undergo synaptic changes following reward conditioning, whilst those that project to centromedial nucleus of amygdala undergo synaptic changes following fear conditioning ( ). Hence, it follows that the importance of hypotrophy of such pivotal region such is basolateral nucleus of amygdala in patients with OSA should not be ignored. It is easy to postulate that this deficit must have reverberating impact on the patients\u2019 ability to decipher the very valence of ongoing life experiences and that in others lead to emotional blunting such can be seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia ( ,  ,  ). \n\nBzdok and colleagues highlighted the role of basolateral amygdala for processing and integrating environmental information and coordinating high-level sensory input, while the centromedial area is associated with mediating attentional, vegetative, and motor responses. Furthermore, they showed that the right basolateral amygdala is coactivated with the following regions: the left amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporal pole, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex bilaterally, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus\/associative auditory cortex, middle frontal gyrus\/frontal eye field, hippocampus, and posterior superior temporal sulcus on the left side ( ). Our results are largely in agreement with the above-mentioned findings and also with the results of a previous study on amygdala that applied MACM ( ) ( A). It also follows that dysfunction of emotional, sensory, and limbic processes reported in some patients with OSA might be partly explained with structural and functional alteration of right amygdala\/hippocampus region ( A). \n\n\n#### Hippocampus \n  \nThe very possibility of a tripartite link between amygdala, memory impairment and OSA also posits itself as worthy of further exploration. The notion that activation of the amygdala during emotional arousal enhances memory in part by modulating plasticity in the hippocampus is not a new one ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, aberrant functional connectivity of amygdala and hippocampus may interact with dysfunctional intrinsic network activity in MDD ( ), which might be related to emotional memory disturbances in OSA as well. Moreover, an aberrant connectivity between the hippocampus and the cerebellum has been reported in OSA patients, with view that this may lead to alterations in a distributed memory system for associative learning ( ). In addition, bilateral enlargement of hippocampus in OSA patients has been reported previously ( ) \n\nOf some note is that our results suggest higher damage to the anterior\/ventral part of the hippocampal formation. In primates amygdala-projecting neurons are focally restricted to the most anterior (uncal) CA1 and pro-subiculum ( ), and fMRI activations associated with emotional memory in humans have been found to be primarily in anterior regions ( ). There is also evidence of double dissociation between semantic processing in the anterior hippocampus and non-semantic processing in the posterior hippocampus. One example of semantic processing that requires flexible expression of memory is transitive inference ( ), or a form of inferential and deductive reasoning, another previously reported deficit in OSA patients ( ). \n\nSimilar to our findings, Weng and colleagues found significant grey matter atrophy mainly on the right in the parahippocampus in their meta-analysis ( ). Several preclinical studies also highlighted parahippocampus and hippocampal formation as important node contributing to the structural and functional abnormalities in OSA. For example, it has been demonstrated that the hippocampus is the region with high vulnerability to intermittent hypoxia, which may underlie the high frequency of neurobehavioral deficits observed frequently in OSA ( ). Moreover, chronic episodic hypoxia during sleep impairs substantial region-selective neuronal loss within the CA1 region and leads to spatial learning impairments ( ). The co-activation results of our study for the right hippocampal formation, (inclusive of anterior CA1 region), are also in agreement with the previously reported hippocampal co-activated networks (e.g. mPFC, bilateral superior frontal gyri, left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, cingulate cortex, thalamus, fusiform gyrus) and as such they might go some way towards explaining deficits in patients with OSA in perceptual, cognitive and affective processing domains ( ). In the same vein, the functional characterization of the regions highlighted by our study suggests deficits in the perceptual, cognitive and affective processing domains (Figs.   A,   A). Also, one can argue that recently shown association of OSA with AD and cognitive deficits noted in patients with OSA could be in part explained with hippocampal dysfunction, as previously demonstrated in AD ( ,  ,  ). In addition, another meta-analysis recently suggested that patients with AD could have 5 times higher rate of presenting OSA symptoms than healthy individuals ( ). \n\nOf note is also that a majority of highlighted aberrant findings in our study were found to be non-dominant-sided. It has been suggested that there is a general hemispheric lateralization of perceptual processing, with lateralization of serial or local processing (on the left) versus parallel, global or holistic processing (on the right) ( ). In a similar manner, some authors argue that rather than providing a single common function, the two hippocampi provide complementary representations for navigation (e.g. places on the right and temporal sequences on the left), both of which likely contribute to different aspects of episodic memory ( ). The right hippocampus appears specifically involved in memory tasks requiring allocentric processing of spatial locations and hence its impairment may have clinical reverberations in patients\u2019 accurate large-scale navigation ( ), and it may possibly also negatively affect the driving ability in OSA patients. By contrast, the left hippocampus appears to be involved in episodic\/autobiographical memory ( ). Similarly, it has been suggested that during response monitoring, the right amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex may mediate aversive conditioning to errors, whereas the left amygdala may underpin detrimental negative affect concerning performance ( ). The possible clinical implication for our OSA patients would be that combined activity in these structures, which may serve to help us learn from our mistakes without becoming overly upset about them, is not optimal. Malfunction within this system could conceivably also contribute to the genesis of previously reported neuropsychiatric deficits prevalent in OSA, such as depression, emotional lability, anxiety or even aggravation of the PTSD. \n\nTaken together, our study posits the amygdala and the hippocampal formation as important affected nodes in OSA neuropathology. \n\n\n\n### Insula and OSA \n  \nThe right insular cortex has been highlighted as another cortical structure of importance by our results ( B). So far, insular cortex has been somewhat ignored in theoretical constructs of likely neuropathology that underscores the affective and cognitive deficits in patients with OSA. Neuroanatomically, insula presents a nexus at the confluence of several neural pathways. It is densely interconnected with itself and with almost all cortical association regions ( ,  ,  ). It has been shown to receive sensory, somesthetic and interoceptive inputs from cortical areas and via the thalamus ( ,  ). It is also interconnected with the medial temporal lobe, amygdala, and basal ganglia ( ). It has been long proposed that the integration of all these inputs might present the neural substrate for human phenomenological experience, i.e. our own idiosyncratic conscious perception and understanding of a particular situation or phenomenon, further underscoring the importance of this structure (for detailed overview please refer to ( ). \n\nOur data suggests that OSA patients have convergent hypo-activation of the right central insula compared to healthy controls ( B). Novel insights into the functional organization and specialization of the insula suggest that activity in the insula correlates with the degree of subjective salience, whether it is influenced by homeostatic, emotional or cognitive factors ( ,  ). Moreover, the subdivisions of insular cortex have been shown to be co-dependent, and each subdivision participates to varying degrees in nearly every task domain that has been investigated, including those involving language, memory, sensory (from gustation and olfaction, to music perception), interoception, somesthesis and emotional processing ( ). Again, it can be argued that the majority of listed functions have been recognized as abnormal or lacking to a varied degree in some patients with OSA ( ). \n\nThe relative salience of the multitude of informational inputs during wakefulness determines those inputs which deserve attention ( ). An intrinsic brain system known as the \u2018salience network\u2019, with key nodes in the insular cortices, has a central role in the detection of behaviorally relevant stimuli and the coordination of neural resources ( ). Emerging evidence suggests that atypical engagement of specific subdivisions of the insula within the SN is a feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including of AD and MDD ( ,  ,  ). In OSA, localized cortical thinning has been reported in the region of insular cortices ( ) and bilaterally anterior insular neuronal damage and increased glial activation has also been shown ( ). Similarly, selective functional disconnection between the right anterior insula and the medial prefrontal cortex was correlated with the severity of the OSA in a very recent study, whilst the functional disconnection between the insula and the posterior cingulate cortex was correlated with depressive scores and working memory performance of patients with OSA ( ). Of other sleep disorders, patients with insomnia have also been shown to have a greater involvement of the anterior insula, as well as insula BOLD correlation with EEG gamma frequency power during rest ( ). Moreover, this increased involvement of the anterior\/ventral insula was associated with negative affect. For instance, it has been suggested that here aberrant activation of the insula in arousal networks may underlie the misperception of sleep quality and subjective distress in insomnia ( ). Given that insomnia and sleep apnea frequently co-exist ( ), it is tempting to postulate that recently highlighted divergent results of subjective versus objective complaints in OSA patients may also be a reflection of similar misperception and\/or interoception of variety of bodily and cognitive functions in a subgroup of patients with OSA ( ). \n\nCauda and colleagues demonstrated that anterior insula, mainly on the right side, plays an important role in saliency detection and cognition ( ). Moreover, the insula can be parcellated to the anterior part, which is characterized by an attentional pattern of connectivity with frontal, cingulate, parietal, cerebellar regions, whereas the posterior part is characterized by a more local connectivity pattern with connections to sensorimotor, temporal and posterior cingulate areas ( ). It has also been shown that posterior insula is mainly activated by interoception, perception and emotion ( ). In broad agreement with previous functional implications for insular cortices, the results of our meta-analyses implicate right central insular region as well as point to the deficits in perceptual, somatosensory and affective processing (Figs.   B,   B). Arguably our findings also suggest that sensory and cognitive task-related modulations of the altered wider neurocircuitry in sleep apnea patients lead to a weaker central insular cortex\u2019s functional connectivity and activation during a given task, by comparison to healthy volunteers. However, the possibility that, as of yet unclear maladaptive structural process in sleep apnea patients, leads to plastic alterations and to the \u201cfunctional\u201d deactivation of this very region, should not be overlooked. \n\nIn that vein and regarding hemispheric lateralization of insular changes highlighted by our study, an interesting study suggests insight into the potential mechanisms behind the pathological process at hand ( ). Namely, Yadav and colleagues recently showed bilateral insular neuronal damage in OSA patients with higher glial activation and neuroinflammation on the left ( ). The authors speculated that asymmetrical outcome could stem from the larger cerebral blood flow on the right side with the consequences of hypoxemic periods during apnea having a relatively reduced effect on the right over the left side ( ). In view of our results, however, another interesting possibility presents itself. In contrast to their finding, our results suggest higher impact on the right and conceivably may also suggest an adaptive role for the microglial activation early on, or at certain stages, during the chronic process of OSA in some patients. How, when and which of the neuroinflammation processes may be protective\/adaptive, and which detrimental\/maladaptive, has become one of the crucial questions in fields of neurodegenerative, psychiatric, traumatic and ischemic diseases, and it is of further interest that many of diseases (etc. MDD, AD, stroke) have been found co-morbid or even prevalent in patients with OSA ( ). \n\n\n### The convergent role for amygdala and insula? \n  \nIn order to perform a particular neural function, to form a thought or an emotion, a set of brain networks or systems needs to transiently interact ( ). The function and structure of such networks is of particular interest given that abnormalities in the interactions of network components can play a critical role in neuropsychiatric disorders, with damage to specific functional connectivity nodes and networks giving rise to distinct neurological and psychiatric syndromes ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The results of our conjunctional meta-analysis point to functionally important co-activation between our seeds (in the right amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula) and the bilateral anterior insula, bilateral thalamus, as well as the posterior-medial frontal cortex ( A). Assessing the behavioral characterization of both seeds using the BrainMap database demonstrated significant involvement of somatosensory and affective processing (  B). These findings are in agreement with previous MACM and behavioral decoding studies on the right amygdala\/hippocampus and right insula ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nThe regions highlighted by our meta-analyses: the right amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula all exist, or contribute to, the flow of information as connection hubs on one of the three important intrinsic connectivity networks: the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN) and the salience network (SN). Of these, CEN (including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex) and DMN (including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) and PCC are two important anti-correlated cognitive-related networks ( ,  ). The DMN plays a competitive role with the majority of task-related networks and the activation of a cognitive task-related network is commonly accompanied by deactivation of the DMN ( ,  ). It has been shown that the connectivity within DMN regions in task-fMRI studies contributes to the facilitation or monitoring of cognitive performance, and that the differences in functional coupling within DMN regions can predict differences in cognitive performance ( ). \n\nOver the years, numerous neuroimaging studies have been performed to identify structural and functional brain impairments in OSA patients in order to explain for noted emotional and cognitive deficits, including altered brain activation and deactivation in the CEN, DMN and SN ( ,  ). Defective deactivation of DMN in patients with OSA during task has been suggested by findings of one study, which also proposed the intermittent hypoxia damage as a more likely culprit behind observed aberrant connectivity ( ). In addition, differential compensatory spatial recruitment of the task positive network and DMN has been demonstrated, with a different pattern of spatial recruitment and deactivation noted in comparison to healthy controls ( ). An altered activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN during working memory tasks in OSA patients has also been shown ( ). Similarly, in rs-fMRI studies functional disconnection in brain areas of the CEN and DMN in OSA patients has been reported ( ). Taken together, these findings might be taken to suggest a role for the functional impairment of the CEN and DMN in cognitive deficits in patients with OSA. Of note, some of those alterations have been reported as reversible and CPAP treatment has been shown to increase the connectivity of the DMN in elderly patients with OSA and to attenuate cortical thinning ( ). \n\nThe functional disconnection of the insular cortex with the CEN and DMN networks has been reported in normal aging and many neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative disorders ( ,  ,  ). In keeping with the findings of our meta-analysis that highlighted ventral insular cortex as an important node in somatosensory, neurocognitive, perceptual and affective deficits in patients with OSA, a recent study has demonstrated decreased functional connectivity of the right insular cortex with the main nodes of the DMN. This has been taken to indicate the functional disconnection between the SN and DMN in OSA patients ( ). In addition, the decrease in functional connectivity between the right AI and the mPFC has been significantly correlated with the apnea and hypopnea index (AHI value). This correlation has been taken to suggest the injury by the intermittent hypoxia as the most likely culprit underscoring the aberrant disconnection ( ). It has been suggested that the functional disconnection between the insular cortex and the DMN may in itself be sufficient to lead to aberrant cognitive control signals and to result in cognitive impairment in OSA patients ( ). In addition, in another study, the abnormal insular cortex metabolites in adults with OSA showed significant correlations with disease severity and neuropsychological status, suggesting not just cognitive but also emotional\/affective impact of this disconnection ( ). \n\nFinally, we found significant connectivity between the seeds (the right amygdala\/hippocampus and right central insula) and bilateral anterior insula and left opercular area, bilateral thalamus, as well as posterior-medial frontal cortex ( A). This pattern closely resembles the canonical frontoparietal executive control network (e.g. CEN) identified in many studies of cognitive control over emotional and non-emotional material ( ). This coordinated network has also been observed using rs-fMRI and as previously noted; it has been reliably dissociated from the SN ( ). The executive control network in healthy controls does not normally include the amygdala or insula, and thus coupling of these two structures with this network and impaired dissociation with SN, and possibly also impaired deactivation of DMN in patients, likely further reflects a chronic disorder driven network-level neural adaptation. \n\nIn summary, the noted aberrant connectivity could be argued to underlie previously reported dysmetric deficits of affect, attention, information processing and visuo-motor control ( ,  ). Of further note, similar aberrant connectivity with some of these networks has also been recently reported in patients with generalised anxiety disorder, MDD, and PTSD ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Research in context \n  \nRecently, an ALE meta-analysis on eight VBM studies found significant reductions in gray matter of the bilateral parahippocampal (more robust on the right side) and frontotemporal regions (less-pronounced) in patients with OSA ( ). Similarly, our meta-analysis suggests convergent grey matter atrophy and functional hypo-activation in the basolateral amygdala and the hippocampal formation. Unlike their study, our ALE analysis included both structural and functional (e.g. task-fMRI and rs-fMRI) neuroimaging studies in order to comprehensively assess both abnormalities in OSA. Due to our stringent inclusion criteria we have excluded several structural studies that were otherwise incorporated by them ( ), For example, we excluded all those previous studies that did not report standard space coordinates ( ,  ), studies that did not find group difference between OSA patients and controls ( ), and one interventional study ( ). In addition, in our meta-analysis we used as a statistically significant cut off point P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the FWE in cluster level. This cut off point is more conservative than False Discovery Rate (FDR) used in that meta-analyses ( ) and as such has likely had an impact on our results. Moreover, we indentified behavioral characterization of the seed regions using the BrainMap database and also task-based co-activation patterns of functionally connected areas to these regions, which have not been previously done. \n\n\n### Potential limitations of the present study \n  \nCoherent summary of the neuroimaging literature about the impact of OSA on the brain that is growing in scope and complexity requires increasingly sophisticated tools for synthesizing findings across studies. The meta-analysis has been accepted as an important tool to develop new hypotheses on structure\u2013function correspondence and to establish consensus on the locations of functional regions in diseases such as OSA across previously published studies ( ,  ,  ). Nonetheless, the meta-analysis itself is not fully immune of limitations that arise from characteristics of the primary studies under review ( ). It is hence of importance to recognize that despite best efforts to circumvent many limitations connected to single studies and the stringent exclusion and inclusion criteria used, the studies included in our meta-analysis differed regarding design, methodology, and the study population. Unfortunately, none of the above mentioned analysis, controlled for age or gender covariates across studies due to current methodological limitations. In addition, the majority of the included studies in our meta-analysis investigated the brain activation or changes in a sample of men without consideration of possible gender differences and thus, we were not able to identify the activation patterns separately for both genders. Similarly, it is impossible to account for separate activation patterns at various stages of OSA in different study populations, and to discern the temporal vector of the noted changes. Additionally, it should be also noted that although we included all available neuroimaging studies that satisfied our predetermined criteria, it is still possible that the sample size for our meta-analysis has underpowered our findings. For example, in this study our exclusion criteria stipulated exclusion of interventional studies and it is possible that their inclusion might have strengthened our findings. Future studies can apply various cognitive and emotional task fMRI to understand different angels of the associated neuropsychiatric symptoms of OSA (e.g. memory loss, depression). Moreover, we did not find any results from rs-fMRI experiments maybe because of low number of available rs-fMRI studies. rs-fMRI as a promising non-invasive tool is, however, currently widely employed to measure functional connectivity alteration in different neuropsychiatric disorders and maybe future studies can implement it to assess the intrinsic functional abnormalities in OSA. \n\nBeside those primary source-related issues, the very determination of the consistent brain structures differences remains the problem in various meta-analysis methods, including in the ALE method, which was utilized in this study. The CBMA method uses precise coordinates (rather than general regional labels) as its input. The issue arises from the fact that these peak coordinate foci are limited indicators of the location of a significant anatomical difference ( ,  ). Finally, during the ALE analysis, overlapping clusters of difference are commonly found by averaging across different peak coordinates, increasing the risk that with two or more relatively nearby peak foci, ALE will find an average, \u2018significant\u2019 cluster somewhere between these foci in a brain region which was actually not reported in the source studies ( ). On the other hand, one study recommended using image-based rather than CBMA method in ALE meta-analysis, which was applied in this study. The reason is the CBMA method provide less information from each study ( ). However, the original data is often very difficult to obtain from previous studies than reported peak coordinates. Hence, CBMA is still the standard ALE approach to detect convergent regional abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe impact of oxidative and neuroinflammatory effects of OSA on the right amygdala\/hippocampus along with the right insular cortex and other subcortical and cortical structures plays an important role, which has been previously suggested to underscore several of subjective and objective cognitive and emotional complaints of adult OSA patients ( ). Here, we present findings of the meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies that also implicates the right amygdala\/hippocampus complex and the insular cortex as important nodes on the affected cognitive and affective circuitry in OSA patients. Moreover, in accordance with this and previous studies, the behavioral characterization of the entire highlighted network using the BrainMap database suggested implications for the emotional and memory related functions, as well as somatosensory processing in the affected patients. A MACM analysis demonstrated that the right amygdala\/hippocampus and insula are part of a joint network comprising the anterior insula, posterior-medial frontal cortex and thalamus. Further, our study strongly suggested non-dominant lateralization of noted chronic deficits in OSA. It was outside the scope of this paper to provide any detailed mechanistic insights behind this phenomenon, however, its significance should not be ignored and should be further explored in future studies. \n\nTaken collectively, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies in patients with OSA have delineated a putative regional \u201cfingerprint\u201d of OSA-induced brain injury. They purport a disconnection of the fronto-parietal regions and a disruption of the thalamocortical oscillator, with involvement of the hippocampal formation ( ,  ). \n\nOne of the challenges for future research will be to establish and differentiate the nuanced task fMRI profiles and patterns of functional connectivity of particular subdivisions of the insula and amygdala with the intrinsic brain networks in OSA patients. Given the burgeoning body of research into aberrant connectivity of intrinsic brain networks and their implication in disorders such as AD and other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, the ability to decipher correct or convergent biomarkers for each of these disorders can not be overstated. Ideally, any such research would also make it possible to delineate specific contribution of several of neuropathological facets of OSA injury on any changes noted, e.g. sleep fragmentation versus the impact of intermittent hypoxia versus any other confounding factors such as obesity. This has so far been difficult to implement, but future careful experimental designs might help with this issue. In particular targeted cognitive and emotional tasks fMRI studies could be well positioned to explore some of the previously reported neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with OSA. Finally, it is hoped that the findings presented here may offer a tentative first step towards this task, as well as to provide an initial theoretical framework for interpreting the aberrant activity within these network nodes. \n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5103027,"text_md5":"1081d6c0b6512bd1e64e50e98c04a47f","field_positions":{"authors":[0,191],"journal":[192,213],"publication_year":[215,219],"title":[230,352],"keywords":[366,493],"abstract":[506,2255],"body":[2264,55871]},"batch":1,"pmid":27039344,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2016.03.026","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5103027","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5103027"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5103027\">5103027<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5103027  Structural and functional neural adaptations in obstructive sleep apnea: An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis"}

Emerging evidence indicates an overlap in the neural substrates of anhedonia between MDD and SZ, which supported a transdiagnostic approach. Therefore, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in MDD and SZ to examine the neural bases of three subdomains of anhedonia: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia and emotional processing. ALE analysis focused specifically on MDD or SZ was used later to dissociate specific anhedonia-related neurobiological impairments from potential disease general impairments. ALE results revealed that consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral basal ganglia areas, while anticipatory anhedonia was associated with more substrates in frontal-striatal networks except the ventral striatum, which included the dorsal anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus. MDD and SZ patients showed similar neurobiological impairments in anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, but differences in the emotional experience task, which may also involve affective\/mood general processing. These results support that anhedonia is characterized by alterations in reward processing and relies on frontal-striatal brain circuitry. The transdiagnostic approach is a promising way to reveal the overall neurobiological framework that contributes to anhedonia and could help to improve targeted treatment strategies. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007\/s11682-015-9457-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnhedonia is defined as \u2018markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day\u2019 (Association and Association  ). Although anhedonia has long been considered a prominent symptom in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SZ) (Association and Association  ), its underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recently, evidence has emerged to indicate overlap of behavioral, cognitive processing and neurobiological abnormalities between MDD and SZ patients with marked clinical anhedonia (Gradin et al.  ; Whitton et al.  ). As a result of this finding and the advocacy of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project (Insel et al.  ), investigators are seeking to use the basic behavioral dimension of functioning, rather than traditional diagnostic categories, to identify transdiagnostic neural markers of anhedonia (Corral-Frias et al.  ; Cuthbert and Insel  ; Markou et al.  ). A quantitative meta-analysis of pooled neuroimaging studies of anhedonia in MDD and SZ, discussed within the RDoC framework, is a promising approach to investigate the neural substrates of anhedonia. However, it is important to be mindful of the complexity and multi-faceted nature of clinical anhedonia to understand neuroimaging studies in this field. \n\nBased on the latest studies, anhedonia is a multidimensional construct and should not simply be considered as \u2018loss of an ability to experience pleasure\u2019. Deficits in other reward processes, such as valuation, motivation and decision-making, may lead to behaviors that can be interpreted as anhedonia (Der-Avakian and Markou  ; Gold et al.  ; Leventhal et al.  ). Hence, distinguishing the deficits in different cognitive subcomponents of anhedonia is essential to identify its neurobiological substrates. Some investigators have suggested dichotomizing anhedonia into \u2018consummatory anhedonia\u2019 (the hedonic response to rewards) and \u2018anticipatory anhedonia\u2019 (diminished motivation to pursue rewards) (Treadway and Zald  ). Others hold that studies should move away from conceptualization of anhedonia as a steady-state, mood-like phenomena, and instead focus on the reward-related motivational\/decisional-making aspect (Treadway et al.  ; Whitton et al.  ). Still others propose to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical studies by isolating the neural substrates of various processes, such as sensing a pleasant stimulus or anticipating expected rewards, computing value and associated costs, determining effort required, deciding to obtain the reward, increasing motivation and performing the action (Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Changing research strategies and models demand more complicated and elaborate experimental designs to investigate the underlying neural bases of anhedonia. \n\nSeveral experimental paradigms have been developed in last decade to explore the specific processes of anhedonia beyond hedonic capacity, such as anticipation, motivation and reinforcement learning. However, only a few task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have separated anhedonia deficits into different processing stages. Early neuroimaging studies frequently adopted the passive picture-viewing task based on the viewpoint that anhedonia represents a diminished responsiveness to positive-valence stimuli (Hooker et al.  ; Mitterschiffthaler et al.  ; Shi et al.  ). More recently, some experimental reward paradigms, especially the monetary incentive delay task (MID) (Admon et al.  ; Balodis and Potenza  ; Elman et al.  ), have been increasingly used to detect neural substrates of anhedonia. Those studies have typically explored brain activity impairments in experience\/consummatory and motivational\/anticipatory stages separately, and they discussed the link between anhedonia and the reward-processing components of \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019 from the preclinical literature (Berridge and Robinson  ; Dillon et al.  ). Specifically, the consummatory stage was primarily associated with dysfunctions of reward coding and evaluation, and the anticipatory stage was associated with advanced cognitive functions, such as motivation and decision-making. Recently, although other paradigms have been developed to assess a specific aspect of anhedonia-related processing, such as the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which focuses on motivation and effort-based decision-making (Fervaha et al.  ; Treadway et al.  ; Yang et al.  ) and the Probabilistic Learning Task (PRT), which focuses on reward learning (Pizzagalli et al.  ), no neuroimaging studies have used these two paradigms in MDD or SZ patients. In fact, to date the majority of studies have explored the neurobiology of the three subdomains of anhedonia, which involve different neurocognitive process and functional neuroanatomy bases: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia and emotional (positive stimuli) processing (Berridge and Robinson  ; Dillon et al.  ; Smoski et al.  ). \n\nNeuroimaging studies of the three subdomains of anhedonia in MDD and SZ patients have reached inconsistent and even contradictory findings. For instance, several studies that used a reward-related task, most often MID, indicated ventral striatal blunting in depressed adults (Knutson et al.  ; Kumar et al.  ; Ubl et al.  ) and even in never-depressed youth with family history of MDD (Gotlib et al.  ). Another study using the same experimental paradigm (MID) showed no significant group difference in ventral striatum between unmedicated MDD and controls after correction (Pizzagalli et al.  ). Furthermore, Pizzagalli et al. ( ) reported decreased activation in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) during the MID task in MDD patients compared with healthy controls, whereas other studies found increased activation of dACC in MDD (Gorka et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ). Similar contradictory results have been observed in SZ patients, especially in the experience\/consummatory stage. When presented with reward stimuli, SZ patients showed impairments in both ventral striatal and prefrontal areas (da Silva Alves et al.  ; Walter et al.  ), impairments in prefrontal cortex but not basal ganglia areas (Waltz et al.  ) or no impairments in either area (Mucci et al.  ; Simon et al.  ). These inconsistencies among studies may reflect differences in sample size, sample characteristics (average age, sexual ratio, medicated or not), paradigms used, and fMRI analysis methods. \n\nThe development of meta-analyses methods for neuroimaging data provide a valuable tool for combining data across diverse studies and building consensus in identification of neuroanatomical correlates of specific behavior. To date, the main methods used for the meta-analyses of neuroimaging data could be divided into two categories: the regions of interest (ROI) based meta-analytic methods, and the voxel-based meta-analytic methods. The ROI-based methods allow for optimal statistical analyses but are based on a priori hypotheses therefore being affected by a limited and potentially biased inclusion of brain regions (Rotge et al.  ; Radua and Mataix-Cols  ). On the other hand, voxel-based methods have a more exhaustive and unbiased inclusion of studies but have some statistically limitation. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), proposed by Turkeltaub and Laird (Turkeltaub et al.  ; Laird et al.  ), is probably the most common algorithm for voxel-based meta-analyses. \n\nBesides the clear mathematical logic and operation steps, ALE method has several advantages over ROI-based meta-analyses through inputting the foci of activation instead of labels, weighting the foci by the number of participants in each study, yielding a quantitative estimate of the probability of activation, identifying common activations across different studies (Laird et al.  ; Wager et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ). More importantly, the recent change from fixed-effects to random-effects inference in analyses (Eickhoff et al.  ) and the revision for multiple comparison correction (Eickhoff et al.  ) made ALE to become a more reliable statistic meta-analysis approach. \n\nTherefore, the ALE meta-analysis method was used in this review to make an objective, systematic, and quantitative analysis of the previous literature and synthesize the anhedonia-related, task-based fMRI findings in MDD and SZ from three subdomains of anhedonia: consummatory anhedonia, anticipatory anhedonia, and emotional processing. Specifically, we first performed the within-group ALE meta-analyses to provide a context for interpreting the anhedonia-related between-group differences. In the between-group analysis, the transdiagnostic ALE analysis of the literature on MDD and SZ was examined to provide an integrated framework of the neural bases of anhedonia, and the analysis focused specifically on MDD or SZ was used later to dissociate specific anhedonia-related neurobiological impairments from potential disease general impairments. The transdiagnostic approach provides the opportunity to identify an overall neurobiological framework for a specific symptom or behavior across multiple disease states and has the potential to improve targeted treatment strategies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nStudies focused on the neurobiology of anhedonia in patients with MDD or SZ were identified through computerized literature searches using PubMed and Web of Science. We reviewed all papers published in the English language up to August 1, 2015. The key words used for the search were \u2018anhedonia\u2019, \u2018hedonic\u2019, \u2018emotional withdrawal\u2019, \u2018pleasure deficit\u2019, \u2018apathetical social withdrawal\u2019, \u2018functional magnetic resonance\u2019 and \u2018fMRI\u2019. A total of 571 English publications were initially identified using this process. Another three articles were obtained from reference lists of prior reviews (Whitton et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). In summary, these search procedures yielded an initial pool of 574 potential articles for inclusion. \n\nIn prior neuroimaging studies focused on anhedonia, the most common paradigms adopted were the MID, reinforcement learning task (RLT) and emotional experience task (EET). For MID, RLT or some modified reward tasks, subjects initially see a cue indicating that they will have an opportunity to obtain a certain amount of reward (e.g., money), then they perform a task, and they receive immediate feedback (by obtaining or not obtaining the reward). The process between the cue and the task refers to anticipation stage, and the in-the-moment experience during receipt of a reward refers to consummatory stage. Besides, the emotional experience task (EET) is associated with a passive viewing of positive-valence stimuli that requires no response. Therefore, based on different cognitive process, we divided anhedonia into three subdomains: anticipatory anhedonia, consummatory anhedonia, and emotional processing. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \nFor the current meta-analysis, once duplicate articles were removed, the following eight inclusion criteria were utilized: (1) first-hand empirical studies; (2) subjects were healthy controls or patients with either MDD or SZ; (3) MDD or SZ were diagnosed according to DSM-IV(\u2212TR) or ICD-10; (4) studies focused on anhedonia though task-related paradigms; (5) studies examined neuronal activity related to anhedonia using fMRI; (6) studies identified foci of task-related neural changes in active conditions (e.g., emotional picture or monetary gain) and\/or contrasted an active and a control condition (neutral picture or fixation cross); (7) coordinates were reported in either standard Talairach space or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. Figure   shows the process of study identification and selection. From the identification and selection of studies, coordinate results of within-group activations and between-group differences were divided into 4 groups: activations in patients, activations in healthy controls, increases in patients relative to controls, and increases in controls relative to patients.   \nFlowchart describing the process of study identification and selection \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) procedure \n  \nMeta-analysis was performed using the ALE software implemented in GingerALE version 2.3.2 ( ). This ALE version used a random effect model and weighted for sample size of the original studies (Laird et al.  ). In ALE, activation foci reported in original studies are treated as 3D Gaussian distributions centered at the reported coordinates. Activation probabilities are then calculated for each standard-space voxel to construct ALE maps for contrasts of interest. To determine the reliability of the ALE map, null-distributions are generated by analyzing the distribution of ALE values across independent studies, which is conceptually similar to using permutation tests of individual voxels across experiments. The observed values in the ALE distribution are then compared to the null distribution in order to assign probability estimates to the observed (experimental) data. \n\nFor the present meta-analysis, single studies were used respectively to perform meta-analyses of anhedonia for each of the three subdomains. Coordinates of the foci of activation reported in MNI were transformed to Talairach space using the icbm2tal in GingerALE. The threshold of statistical significance was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 and corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) with a minimum cluster size of 400\u00a0mm . For visualization, whole-brain maps of thresholded ALE maps were imported into multi-image analysis GUI (MANGO;  ) and overlaid onto a standardized anatomical template in Talairach space ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Article inclusion \n  \nFigure   shows the study selection flowchart, and Table   shows the pooled data for all contrasts. A total of 32 articles with 684 healthy controls reporting 353 foci, and 28 articles with 562 patients reporting 214 foci were included in within-group analysis. A total of 57 articles (33 articles on MDD and 24 on SZ) with 986 patients and 1041 healthy controls and reporting 453 foci were included in the transdiagnostic meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in age or sex between patients (34.33\u2009\u00b1\u20098.55\u00a0years old; 51.09\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (32.12\u2009\u00b1\u20097.09\u00a0years old; 51.71\u00a0% men), MDD patients (36.40\u2009\u00b1\u20098.79\u00a0years old; 40.82\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (33.85\u2009\u00b1\u20098.42\u00a0years old; 39.80\u00a0% men) or between SZ patients (30.75\u2009\u00b1\u20096.96\u00a0years old; 63.64\u00a0% men) and healthy controls (31.85\u2009\u00b1\u20093.70\u00a0years old; 71.33\u00a0% men).   \nPublished fMRI studies included in the between-group ALE analysis of anhedonia across MDD and SZ \n  \n MID   = Monetary Incentive Delay Task;   EET   = Emotional Experience\/regulation Task;   RLT   = Reward Learning Task;   WOF   = Wheel of Fortune task;   MNI   = Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates;   TAL   = Talairach and Tournoux coordinates \n  \n\n\n### Within-group ALE analysis \n  \n#### Healthy controls \n  \nFor reward consummatory (16 studies and 160 foci), ALE revealed a set of subcortical areas, including bilateral globus pallidus (GPe), bilateral red nucleus, right caudate body, left substania nigra (SN) and right putamen, left parahippocampal gyrus, as well as left medial frontal gyrus (mPFC).

For the emotional processing (9 studies and 94 foci), several regions in frontal gyrus were activated to a greater degree, such as mPFC, MFG and IFG, as well as the middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm3, Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nWithin-group ALE meta-analysis results in healthy controls and patients (mixed MDD and SZ) \n  \n p\u2009<  \u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size >400\u00a0mm ;   BA =   Brodmann area \n    \nSignificant ALE maps (FDR corrected,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, cluster size >400\u00a0mm3) of within-group analysis in healthy control group (HC) and transdiagnostic patient group (mixed MDD and SZ) for reward consummatory, reward anticipation, and emotional processing \n  \n\n\n#### Patients (mixed MDD and SZ) \n  \nFor reward consummatory (11 studies and 68 foci), ALE analysis found seven statistically significant activation clusters, including left GPe, right caudate head, left red nucleus, right insula, left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), IFG and amydala. Reward anticipation (14 studies and 63 foci) was related to the significant activation of putamen, superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and IFG. As to the emotional processing (7 studies and 83 foci), increased likelihood of activation was observed in several frontal gyrus, temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, as well as caudate body (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm3, Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ). The results of within-group analysis results in MDD or SZ separately showed the similarly distribution and activation pattern (details see Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Between-group ALE analysis in a transdiagnostic approach across MDD and SZ \n  \n#### Consummatory anhedonia \n  \nFor consummatory anhedonia (29 studies and 151 foci), ALE analysis revealed five statistically significant clusters with decreased likelihood of activation in patients compared to controls (Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ), including bilateral caudate head and body, bilateral GPe, left putamen, right red nucleus, left ventral lateral nucleus and pulvinar, as well as MTG (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01,, FDR corrected, cluster size\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0mm ).

Results revealed that consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral basal ganglia areas, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and various subcortical areas. Anticipatory anhedonia was related to dysfunctions within basal ganglia regions like caudate and putamen, as well as various subregions of prefrontal cortex, such as anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Emotional processing of positive-valence stimuli was related to more distributed dysfunction, involving more of basal ganglia (putamen and GPe), thalamus, limbic regions (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus), prefrontal cortex (IFG, mPFC, ACC), STG and middle occipital gyrus. Meta-analyses of MDD and SZ respectively revealed similar impairments in brain regions and activation patterns in consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia in these two diseases, but differences in emotional processing. \n\n### The neural correlates of different reward processing component \n  \nThe within-group analysis results of healthy controls showed that the three reward processing components related with anhedonia were differentially recruited the subregions in the basal ganglia and forebrain. Specifically, the reward consummatory processing was mainly concentrated on a series of subcortical regions including GPe, ventral striatum, SN, as well as mPFC and extended orbitofrontal cortex, which is consistent with a number of animal and human studies (Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Recent researches suggests that the opioid and GABA-ergic systems may play important role in that hedonic responses (at least to primary sensory stimuli). On the other side, reward anticipatory processing was more involved in dorsal striatum and cortical areas except for the ventral striatum and medial profrontal areas,, such as inferior frontal gyrus and insula. Those results highlighted importance of frontostriatal circuitry in reward anticipatory\/prediction processing (Barch and Dowd  ; Jarbo and Verstynen  ) and indicated that further investigation are needed on identifying the connectivites between subareas of frontal cortex and striatum for specific reward component. Unlike the neural correlates of reward consummatory and anticipation, the within-group analyses for emotional processing task revealed much more widely distributed cortical areas in healthy controls, but not many subcortical regions. Those results suggested that the activated brain areas in emotional experience task may be the synthesis of various cognitive and emotional response related with reward. Furthermore, both the transdiagnostic analysis with mixed patients group and the analysis with MDD or SZ group separately showed a similarly contributed but less activated pattern with that of healthy controls in each of the subdomains of anhedonia. \n\n\n### Transdiagnostic neural markers of anhedonia \n  \nIn both MDD and SZ, anhedonia is considered to be a core clinical characteristic (Griffiths et al.  ; Treadway et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). Animal studies have demonstrated parallel substrates across different disorders associated with altered anhedonia-related processing (Barr and Phillips  ; Der-Avakian and Markou  ). Therefore, researchers suggested that common pathological mechanisms could underlie anhedonia-related processing, supporting a transdiagnostic approach to reveal these underlying cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms. In this review, we applied an ALE meta-analysis to MDD and SZ to provide an integrated framework of the neural bases of anhedonia. \n\nBased on the results of this transdiagnostic meta-analysis, consummatory anhedonia is related to decreased activation in several subcortical regions, such as caudate head and body, putamen, red nucleus, GPe, and pulvinar. Animal studies have demonstrated involvement of the ventral striatum and ventral pallidum in the experience of pleasure and hedonic perception of rewards (Berridge and Kringelbach  ; Kelley et al.  ). Furthermore, patients with ventral pallidus damage have significantly reduced responses to rewards or pleasant stimuli (Miller et al.  ; Vijayaraghavan et al.  ). Consistent with previous findings, our meta-analysis further implicated the opioid and GABA-ergic systems in the nucleus accumbens shell and its projections to the ventral pallidum, in deficits of in-the-moment hedonic experience. Specifically, reduced caudate activation has been reported to be associated with blunted processing of incentive perception and reinforcement learning in both MDD and SZ (Dowd and Barch  ; Pizzagalli  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ). A more recent conceptualization of pulvinar function posited that this region plays an important role in emotional salience and awareness (Hamilton et al.  ; Pessoa and Adolphs  ) and has strong bidirectional connectivity with insula and dACC (Mufson and Mesulam  ). Given this role of the pulvinar, we propose that low-level pulvinar activation may blunt hedonic experience through insufficient attention and awareness of reward-related information. To summarize, ALE meta-analysis on consummatory anhedonia processing emphasized the critical role of ventral basal ganglia and medial prefrontal pathways in generating the in-the-moment hedonic value representation and experience. \n\nFor anticipatory anhedonia, ALE showed involvement of the caudate and putamen, as well as several prefrontal subregions, such as dACC (BA32), mPFC and MFG. Previous studies suggested that multiple prefrontal-striatal pathways and reciprocal connections within subregions of PFC play an important role in regulating behavioral response to rewards or pleasurable stimuli in the motivational\/anticipatory stage (Der-Avakian and Markou  ; Salamone and Correa  ). For instance, disruption of glutamatergic signaling between the mPFC and nucleus accumbens resulted in avolition for rewards (Faure et al.  ). Moreover, striatal lesions or dopamine depletion in striatum or dACC impaired the computation of effort-related costs, which then lead to a deficit of effort-based decision-making as the expected rewards were discounted (Croxson et al.  ). Preclinical studies further stressed that dACC plays an important role in signaling the net value (benefits minus costs) during social interactions (Apps and Ramnani  ). In brief, during the anticipation stage for reward or pleasurable stimuli, abnormal activation in mPFC, dACC and MFG may lead to failure to anticipate forthcoming rewards, including updating\/maintaining the value of pleasant stimuli, effort-value computation, decision-making to engage in goal-directed activity and monitoring incentive-based behavioral responses (Haber and Knutson  ; Pujara and Koenigs  ; Wallis and Kennerley  ). The results of our meta-analysis consistently indicated that a number of brain regions and pathways, involving many neurotransmitter systems, mediated different aspects of anhedonia-related deficits. Consequently, this preliminary neural framework supports the conceptualization of anhedonia as a symptom with multiple components. Rigorous experimental paradigms and careful designs should be carried out in future work to provide a more refined description of anhedonia and to separate the neural bases of each aspect of anhedonia-related processing. \n\nOur ALE analysis for anticipatory anhedonia also revealed reduced activation of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, which could impair retrieval of previous autobiographical memories and their incorporation into working memory to represent the value of a reward and anticipate a pleasurable stimulus (Adcock et al.  ; Zhu et al.  ; Mazgaj et al.  ). However, we did not observe any significant group difference between patients and controls in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is considered to be a key cortical region involved in anhedonia, in particular in the reward value presentation (Kringelbach  ; Pizzagalli  ). One possible explanation is that detection of OFC is challenging for functional MRI experiments using regular EPI sequences due to strong magnetic susceptibility variation near the air-filled sinuses and corresponding signal loss and distortion (Faro et al.  ; Osterbauer et al.  ). Future investigation of this unique structure will benefit from advances in imaging sequences or MRI hardware. \n\nGiven the complex neural pathways in the frontal-striatal-thalamic circuitry, it is necessary to further divide each subcortical structure (e.g., striatum) into subregions to investigate the function of different cortical-subcortical connections. For instance, the striatum can be divided into three functional subregions (i.e., limbic, associative and sensorimotor) based on afferent inputs from the frontal cortex (Haber  ; Haber et al.  ; Iversen  ; van den Bos et al.  ). Consummatory anhedonia is mainly associated with limbic\/ventral striatum, including anterior and ventral caudate and putamen (Corral-Frias et al.  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ), whereas anticipatory anhedonia is associated with both limbic\/ventral striatum and associative striatum, including the dorsal caudate and anterior part of the dorsal putamen (Delgado  ; Dichter et al.  ; Mucci et al.  ). The results of our meta-analysis provide new evidence that dysfunction in distinct frontal-striatal pathways contributes to the different components of anhedonia-related processing. Based on this preliminary neural framework, further studies are needed to identify the functional and structural connections underlying these components of anhedonia-related processing. \n\nALE analysis of the emotional experience task revealed more widely distributed differences between patients and controls. In addition to blunted activation in basal ganglia and thalamus, a number of regions in limbic areas, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cerebellum also showed decreased activation in patients, whereas the visual association cortices showed increased activation. Given that the emotional experience task required no response and may include various cognitive and affective components, it is unclear whether those different activations reflect only the neural bases of anhedonia. Recent resting-state fMRI showed that different neural circuits were engaged in the emotional task-general and emotion task-specific processing (Cole et al.  ), which would be differently activated by the emotional experience task between controls and patients with affective symptoms. Moreover, functional connectivity analysis demonstrated distinct circuits associated with severity of general affective symptoms (i.e., depression) and anhedonia (Gabbay et al.  ). Indeed, a set of brain regions, including the anterior and posterior cingulate, mPFC, basal ganglia and visual areas, were activated during passive viewing of positive-valence stimuli, but the ventral striatum and mPFC were the key regions correlated with self-reported anhedonia severity (Epstein et al.  ; Harvey et al.  ). Therefore, more elaborate experimental designs will be required to explore the underlying neural bases of general mood-related processing and specific emotional experiences (e.g., hedonia). \n\n\n### Disease-specific findings: MDD and SZ \n  \nTo further explore anhedonia-related neural mechanisms and identify potential disease-specific or task-specific confounders, ALE analysis was compared between MDD and SZ patients across the three anhedonia subdomains. In general, anhedonia-related impairment was consistent between MDD and SZ patients across the consummatory and anticipatory stages. Those findings suggest that the neural substrates involved in accurate appraisal of positive stimuli and generation of reward responses, but not the substrates underlying hedonic emotion arousal, are likely to be the core brain areas associated with anhedonia. Furthermore, these data provide a partial explanation for the discordance between self-reported trait pleasure and momentary pleasure in previous behavioral studies: MDD and SZ patients reported normative affective ratings in response to evocative laboratory stimuli, but low positive affect and pleasurable experiences on evaluation of inventories (Osuch et al.  ; Pizzagalli  ; Strauss  ; Treadway and Zald  ). From a cognitive processing pespective, laboratory-based assessment of consummatory anhedonia may reflect the capacity for hedonic experience, while the patient self-reports in clinical interviews and inventories might reflect both the hedonic experience deficit and the inability to accurately represent incentive experiences. Based on this interpretation, the theoretical definition of anhedonia for research and targeted treatment may need to be modified. \n\nIn contrast to the consummatory and anticipatory anhedonia domains, which were similar across MDD and SZ, emotional experience tasks showed striking differences. In MDD patients, decreased activation was much more widely distributed across brain regions, including basal ganglia, amygdala, frontal gyrus and cerebellum; SZ patients only showed decreased activation in thalamus. As previously noted, the emotional experience task requires no response and may reflect other cognitive and affective components. Our results support that the emotional experience task induced both affective\/mood-related and anhedonia-specific responses. It is worth noting that only blunted activation in part of ventral basal ganglia was correlated with anhedonia in MDD patients viewing positive valence pictures (Epstein et al.  ; Mitterschiffthaler et al.  ; Osuch et al.  ), which was highly consistent with the correlations between dysfunctional BOLD signals and anhedonia in a consummatory anhedonia task (Gradin et al.  ; Pizzagalli et al.  ). Overall, it appears that an emotional experience task, such as passively viewing pictures or words, may not be a pure measure of anhedonia (i.e., consummatory anhedonia) and may capture the affective responses related with general mood, which may influence results in populations with prominent depressive symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nPotential limitations of this study should be noted. First of all, ALE technique does have its own limitations. Unlike the meta-analyses in which the complete activation maps are included, the data used in ALE were based solely on reported peak activation coordinates. Thereby ALE could not take into account those studies without any significant clusters reported, which may resulting in a systematic overestimation bias of the results. Besides, the present ALE software cannot conduct the correlation analysis or deal with covariates, thus the only way to consider the covariates was run follow-up analyses, e.g., only on experiments investigating only female subjects or unmedicated patients when considering the gender or medication effect. An additional limitation of the ALE is that it may be unable to assess subtle methodological differences in individual studies such as the thresholding used in the original studies, relative strength of activations\/differences between groups and differences in preprocessing steps (Radua and Mataix-Cols  ). Nevertheless, previous studies suggested that no individual study could significantly bias the results of ALE meta-analyses after including the sample size and number of reported foci into ALE algorithm, changing from fixed-effects to random-effects inference, and revising for multiple comparison correction (Eickhoff et al.  ; Turkeltaub et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Kollndorfer et al.  ). In the present study, the robustness of results was further supported by the reasonably coherent findings in within-group ALE analysis of various reward processing components and between-group analyses of subdomains of anhedonia, which were also consistent with previous neurobioglogical studies on animals. \n\nSecondly, given that the patients in 31\/35 MDD studies and 22\/25 SZ studies were treated in their lifetime by antidepressant or antipsychotics, the drug effects on the brain activated pattern in reward-related processing are potential confounding factors which need to be addressed (Clarke et al.  ; Boccia et al.  ). Most antidepressant treatments act on the serotonergic or noradrenergic circuits, but not directly enhance Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, which plays a significant role in motivation and reward processing (Berridge  ; Treadway and Zald  ). However, recent literature showed that the antidepressant mechanism such as increasing serotonin (5-HT) originating from midbrain raphe nuclei (RN), could sequentially decrease the dopamine inhibition and increased ventral striatal activity to reward in humans and animals (Dremencov et al.  ; Dunlop and Nemeroff  ; Ossewaarde et al.  ; El Yacoubi et al.  ). As for the antipsychotic treatment that directly impacts the DA neurotransmission, evidence showed that the first generation (typical) and second generation (atypical) antipsychotic medications had different effects on the neural correlates of reward\/motivation tasks (Juckel et al.  ,  ; Kirsch et al.  ; Schlagenhauf et al.  ). For instance, Kirsch et al. found that patients with typical antipsychotics showed reduced ventral striatal activation, while atypically treated patients showed significantly stronger activation of the right ventral striatum. Those results were further supported by a controlled, longitudinal study (Nielsen et al.  ) . The different impact of typical and atypical antipsychotics on reinforcement learning of reward processing were also supported by both behavioral evidences (Beninger et al.  ; Keri et al.  ) and neuroimaging data (Insel et al.  ). Further clinical and basic studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanism of those effects. \n\n\n### Conclusion and future directions \n  \nIn summary, our ALE meta-analysis supported characterization of anhedonia by alterations in reward processing, which contain multiple complicated components and rely on many brain regions within frontal-striatal circuitry. Specifically, consummatory anhedonia was associated with decreased activation in ventral striatum and pallidum, while anticipatory anhedonia was more associated with more substrates in frontal-striatal networks except the ventral striatum, which included the dorsal anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus. However, the emotional experience task (passive viewing of positive pictures or words) revealed mixed findings, including dysfunction in both the anhedonia-related and affective\/mood processing regions. Therefore, the transdiagnostic approach holds promise for providing both overall and specific neurobiological frameworks of anhedonia. \n\nAlthough our meta-analysis presents novel, meaningful evidence regarding the neurobiology of anhedonia, it only distinguished the neural substrates of motivation to pursue rewards and hedonic response to rewards. Future work is needed to dissect the different neurobiological pathways that are related to the various reward-processing subcomponents, such as perceiving pleasure, encoding reward value, calculating costs and benefits, learning from prior reinforcement, making decisions and execute the action to pursue a reward. It is important to note that anhedonia also plays an important role in several other psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (Loas et al.  ), post-traumatic stress disorder (Frewen et al.  ) and drug addiction (Balodis and Potenza  ; Hatzigiakoumis et al.  ), albeit in heterogeneous ways. Therefore, combining more categories of disorders and using a greater sample size in future studies should further elucidate the neural foundations of anhedonia. \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4838562,"text_md5":"38decf3ebc7e1f7295c4e56aef792b74","field_positions":{"authors":[0,131],"journal":[132,151],"publication_year":[153,157],"title":[168,258],"keywords":[272,391],"abstract":[404,2189],"body":[2198,43929]},"batch":1,"pmid":26487590,"doi":"10.1007\/s11682-015-9457-6","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4838562","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4838562"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4838562\">4838562<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4838562  Mapping anhedonia-specific dysfunction in a transdiagnostic approach: an ALE meta-analysis"}

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates structural (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) findings in individuals with ODD\/CD with and without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Online databases were searched for controlled studies, resulting in 12 sMRI and 17 fMRI studies. In line with current models on ODD\/CD, studies were classified in hot and cool executive functioning (EF). Both the meta-analytic and narrative reviews showed evidence of smaller brain structures and lower brain activity in individuals with ODD\/CD in mainly hot EF-related areas: bilateral amygdala, bilateral insula, right striatum, left medial\/superior frontal gyrus, and left precuneus. Evidence was present in both structural and functional studies, and irrespective of the presence of ADHD comorbidity. There is strong evidence that abnormalities in the amygdala are specific for ODD\/CD as compared to ADHD, and correlational studies further support the association between abnormalities in the amygdala and ODD\/CD symptoms. Besides the left precuneus, there was no evidence for abnormalities in typical cool EF related structures, such as the cerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Resulting areas are associated with emotion-processing, error-monitoring, problem-solving and self-control; areas associated with neurocognitive and behavioural deficits implicated in ODD\/CD. Our findings confirm the involvement of hot, and to a smaller extent cool, EF associated brain areas in ODD\/CD, and support an integrated model for ODD\/CD (e.g. Blair,   Development and Psychopathology, 17  (3), 865-891,  ). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have provided insight into the underlying brain mechanisms of disruptive behaviour disorders, including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). This review will integrate and discuss studies using structural (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) in these disorders. ODD and CD are developmental disorders that are among the most commonly diagnosed mental health conditions in childhood (Hamilton and Armando  ; Loeber et al.  ). Community samples show a prevalence rate for ODD ranging between 2 and 14\u00a0% and for CD ranging between 2 and 16\u00a0% (Boylan et al.  ; Loeber et al.  ). Both disorders are more prevalent in boys than in girls with ratio\u2019s ranging from 3:1 to 9:1 (Loeber et al.  ). ODD is defined by a frequent and persistent pattern of irritable and angry mood, vindictiveness and developmentally inappropriate, negativistic, defiant, and disobedient behaviour toward authority figures (American Psychiatric Association  ). CD is characterised by a persistent pattern of multiple antisocial behaviours during childhood and adolescence, including fighting, bullying, stealing, vandalism, and lying for personal gain (American Psychiatric Association  ). Depending on whether the individual was younger or older than 10\u00a0years at the time of symptom onset, there is a differentiation between childhood-onset CD and adolescent-onset CD (American Psychiatric Association  ). \n\nAlthough both disorders have some distinct characteristics, the general consensus is that ODD and CD are highly correlated expressions of psychopathology. Till the emergence of the DSM-5, ODD has been coined as a milder version of CD as emphasised by the hierarchical rule stipulated in the DSM-IV stating that a diagnosis of ODD is precluded when CD is present, due to very high levels of ODD features in individuals with CD and the precursory role of ODD for CD. This precursory role of ODD for the later development of CD is supported by a quadrupled risk for the development of CD in individuals with ODD (Burke et al.  ; Loeber et al.  ; Rowe et al.  ). In addition to the high levels of ODD features in CD, comorbidity rates of ODD are as high as 45\u00a0% in children with CD, and in clinical samples these rates increase to up to 96\u00a0% (Loeber et al.  ; Rowe et al.  ). ODD and CD share risk factors in both the psychosocial domain, such as poverty and social disadvantage, and the family domain, such as a history of criminality in biological parents (Rowe et al.  ; Burke et al.  ). An extensive review on the heritability of ODD and CD shows heritability rates of 61 and 74\u00a0%, respectively, with 50\u00a0% of the reported genes being associated with both disorders (Coolidge et al.  ; Lahey and Waldman  ). The presence of either ODD or CD predicts poor future outcomes, including compromised psychiatric, family and social functioning, as well as an increased risk for adverse life events: e.g., peer rejection, criminal behaviour and incarceration at a young age (Burke et al.  ; Hamilton and Armando  ; Loeber et al.  ). When ODD or CD persists, individuals are at a heightened risk for anxiety disorders and depression. Furthermore, persistence of childhood ODD or CD into adulthood results in a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (APD), which is in turn related to high rates of domestic violence, unemployment and homelessness (Loeber et al.  ; Kimonis and Frick  ). APD can only be diagnosed when there is a history of some symptoms of CD and the transition from CD to APD occurs in around 54\u00a0% of individuals with CD (Fairchild et al.  ; American Psychiatric Association  ). Treatment of ODD and CD is generally not specific to either disorder, and a combination of interventions that aim at multiple domains tends to be more successful than treating a singular domain. In the current review, ODD and CD will be treated as representing one dimension of psychopathology, because of the similarities in many domains including aetiology, phenotypical manifestation, correlated features, as well as treatment. We will refer to this dimension as ODD\/CD. \n\nSeveral explanatory models of ODD\/CD focus specifically on neurocognitive impairments, which are thought to be related to abnormalities in underlying brain mechanisms. Neurocognitive impairments that are associated with ODD\/CD include lower IQ, deficiencies in inhibitory control, abnormalities in emotional processing and social cognition, and abnormalities in reinforcement processing. Most of the explanatory models emphasise a deficit in so-called executive functioning (EF). EF is the sum of neurocognitive processes that maintain an appropriate problem-solving set to attain a goal (Pennington and Ozonoff  ; Willcutt et al.  ). A well-known distinction in EF is that between hot and cool EF. Hot EF is characterised by motivational and affective aspects of cognitive processing, such as reinforcement learning, affective decision-making and emotional processing (Anderson et al.  ; Blair and Lee  ; Kerr and Zelazo  ; Zelazo and Carlson  ). Brain areas that are reported to be important for hot EF include the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (Crowe and Blair  ; Prencipe et al.  ; Rubia  ). In contrast, cool EF refers to goal-directed and problem-solving behaviours, as well as self-regulation, not involving motivational or affective aspects. Cool EF encompasses functions using diverse abilities such as inhibition, working memory, planning, flexibility, and the ability to creatively generate solutions for problems (Sarkar et al.  ; Diamond  ). Brain areas reported to be central to cool EF include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum (Prencipe et al.  ; Rubia  ; Yang and Raine  ; Sterzer and Stadler  ). This distinction between hot and cool EF provides a framework to study underlying brain mechanisms of observed behavioural and neurocognitive abnormalities in ODD\/CD. This knowledge can help test theoretical models on ODD\/CD through clarifying involvement of brain areas central to those models. This important information on theoretical model building can in turn help to further advance the field, by yielding supporting or opposing evidence for the involvement of brain areas. \n\nAn altered reinforcement system, and thus a hot EF problem, was proposed in early models on ODD\/CD by Quay ( ,  ) and by Newman and Kosson ( ). Indeed, a recent extensive review in antisocial individuals showed altered sensitivity to reward and punishment and processing of these contingencies (Byrd et al.  ). Specifically, antisocial individuals show an increased affinity for immediate reward over delayed reward, an insensitivity to punishment, and increased reward-seeking (Byrd et al.  ). This altered reinforcement sensitivity has been related to problems in social cognition in individuals with ODD\/CD. For example, these individuals tend to show a preference for more aggressive reactions in social situations, which might be due to their unsparing surge for reward and decreased punishment sensitivity (Burke et al.  ; Loeber et al.  ; Quay and Hogan  ; Rubia  ). In addition, abnormalities in emotional processing have been reported repeatedly in studies with ODD\/CD samples (Byrd et al.  ), including reduced levels of empathy and deficits in the recognition of emotional expressions (Blair  ). Both abnormalities in reinforcement sensitivity and emotional processing in ODD\/CD have been related to abnormalities in hot EF brain areas, such as the amygdala and the striatum (Crowe and Blair  ; Prencipe et al.  ). \n\nAnother important explanatory model, that is more fitting with a cool EF deficit, was proposed by Moffitt ( ), who distinguished between adolescent-limited ODD\/CD, and the more severe, life-course persistent ODD\/CD (Moffitt  ). According to that model, adolescent-limited ODD\/CD is merely a stage in development during which adaptive social behaviour is tested and learned, while life-course persistent ODD\/CD is thought to arise of an interplay between a difficult and under-controlled temperament and adverse environmental factors. This under-controlled temperament is thought to be promoted by a deficit in cool EF, including difficulties in inhibition and self-control (Burke et al.  ; Loeber et al.  ; Moffitt  ). Evidence from neurocognitive studies generally points toward a range of abnormalities in cool EF in ODD\/CD, such as low IQ, inefficiencies in problem solving, and less than optimal inhibitory control (Oosterlaan et al.  ; Burke et al.  ; Loeber et al.  ; Quay and Hogan  , but see Van Goozen et al.  , and have been related to abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Yang and Raine  ; Prencipe et al.  ). \n\nFinally, one of the most influential explanatory models at present is proposed by Blair, who suggests that individuals with ODD\/CD demonstrate impairments in two separate circuits associated with hot and cool EF (Blair  ). According to Blair ( ), the first compromised circuit is involved in emotional processing and regulation and is responsible for an increase in antisocial behaviour. The key component of brain areas underlying this mainly hot EF circuit is supposedly the amygdala. The second compromised circuit is involved in response inhibition and is responsible for loss of temper and exaggerated aggressive responses in individuals with ODD\/CD. The key component of brain areas underlying this mainly cool EF circuit is supposedly the ventrolateral frontal cortex. \n\nSupport for the explanatory models on ODD\/CD is well established in behavioural studies. However, knowledge about these models in terms of structural and functional neuroimaging is incomplete. While a review of the current structural and functional neuroimaging literature would be an ideal way to provide neurobiological evidence to confirm or reject a model, such a review has not been conducted so far. The current review aims to fill this gap with the goal to enhance insight into the underlying mechanisms of ODD\/CD and additionally test the plausibility of hot and cool EF models in ODD\/CD in terms of neural mechanisms. \n\nA highly comorbid condition of ODD\/CD is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most commonly diagnosed disruptive behaviour disorders in children. The percentage of individuals diagnosed with ODD\/CD that additionally qualify for a comorbid ADHD diagnosis ranges up to 35\u00a0%, and up to 50\u00a0% of children with disruptive behaviours show symptoms of both ADHD and ODD\/CD (Loeber et al.  ; Anderson and Kiehl  ; Connor et al.  ; Waschbusch  ). In children and adolescents with ODD\/CD and comorbid ADHD, the prognosis, including the risk to develop anxiety and depressive disorders and antisocial personality disorder, is considerably worse than when only ODD\/CD or only ADHD is present (Dolan and Lennox  ; Loeber et al.  ). In addition, this comorbid group shows an earlier age of symptom onset, exhibits more physical aggression and delinquency, shows significantly higher ODD, CD and ADHD symptom severity, and shows more functional impairments than a group with any of these diagnoses in singularity (Anderson and Kiehl  ; Loeber et al.  ; Waschbusch  ). This highlights the importance of clarifying the specificity of abnormalities associated with ODD\/CD and contrasting ODD\/CD-only with ODD\/CD+ADHD, when studying these disorders. \n\nAlthough previous reviews have addressed structural and functional brain abnormalities in ODD\/CD (Matthys et al.  ; Rubia  ), these reviews were neither systematic reviews, nor focussed exclusively on diagnostic groups of ODD\/CD, nor were set out to investigate the relative contribution of ADHD. To address structural and functional brain anatomical aspects of ODD\/CD, the current comprehensive review includes a complete systematic narrative review as well as meta-analyses using ALE (Eickhoff et al.  ,  ; Laird et al.  ) of the available structural and functional imaging studies. The quantitative approach increases the precision and the power of reported results compared to a purely qualitative review, and indicates which brain areas are most robustly implicated in ODD\/CD. However, since an ALE meta-analysis does not allow inclusion of studies reporting on non-significant group differences, the narrative review provides the necessary balance in interpreting the findings. The narrative review complied with the standards of a systematic review, performing a literature search based on a detailed plan and search strategy, and had the goal of reducing bias by identifying, appraising and synthesising all relevant studies on this topic. In addition, we investigated the specificity of brain correlates. Firstly, we investigated specificity by discussing results from studies using ODD\/CD-only samples separately from results from studies using ODD\/CD+ADHD samples. Secondly, we compared results of samples including individuals with ODD\/CD (with and without comorbid ADHD) to samples including individuals with ADHD-only. In addition, we reported associations between abnormalities in investigated structures and ODD\/CD related symptoms. Knowledge about the specificity of reported abnormalities may help to clarify the heterogeneity in studies on ODD\/CD. \n\nThis review is divided in two sections. The first section deals with structural findings, integrating findings for all reported brain areas; the second section deals with functional findings, and is divided in a part describing hot EF and a subsequent part describing cool EF, based on the assessed tasks and contrasts. Each section starts with a quantitative meta-analysis, for which an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was performed. ALE is a technique that is used to identify significant anatomical locations for which effects are consistent, and that is robust to publication bias (for a detailed description of ALE see: Eickhoff et al.  ; Laird et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ). This quantitative meta-analysis is followed by a narrative review. Then, both the sections on structural and functional findings are integrated to provide a complete overview of all involved brain areas and to assess the evidence for abnormalities in terms of hot and cool EF related brain areas. We expected to find abnormalities in brain structure and function of individuals with ODD\/CD subserving both hot EF (i.e., the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (Rubia  ; Prencipe et al.  ; Crowe and Blair  )) and cool EF (i.e. the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Rubia  ; Prencipe et al.  ; Yang and Raine  ; Sterzer and Stadler  )), which would be in line with an integrated model such as the model proposed by Blair. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study Selection \n  \nThis review included all empirical studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study reported on functional or structural magnetic resonance imaging results, comparing (a) individuals with ODD\/CD with or without comorbid ADHD to control subjects, and if included, to individuals with ADHD-only, or (b) individuals with ODD\/CD without ADHD to ODD\/CD individuals with ADHD. The control group of each study was carefully checked on reported psychiatric disorders, and when a study reported on the presence of any psychiatric disorder in participants of the control group, that study was excluded from the current study. This resulted in the exclusion of two studies. (2) Diagnosis of the participants had to be based on DSM-III, DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria. (3) The study had to be published in a peer-reviewed English language journal. No limits were set on the ages of participants. All relevant studies published up till June 2015 were incorporated. \n\nThe databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo and Web of Science were searched, using the search terms ODD, CD, disruptive behavioural disorder, disruptive behaviour, externalising behavioural disorder, externalising behaviour, MRI, neuroimaging, and equivalent MeSH terms. Furthermore, reference lists of selected studies and reviews were checked for additional relevant studies. A total of 576 studies were initially retrieved and screened, after which a total of 67 studies remained that fulfilled inclusion criteria based on screening of the title and abstract. These 67 studies were further assessed for eligibility using the full text of the study, resulting in 29 studies that met inclusion criteria and were incorporated in the present review; see Fig.\u00a0  for the flow diagram of included studies. The 29 studies selected for review included a total of 1278 individuals, including 713 patients and 565 controls.   \nPRISMA flow diagram showing the process of study selection \n  \n\nIn this review, we distinguished the following samples: (1) ODD\/CD-only, including only individuals with ODD\/CD without comorbid ADHD, (2) ODD\/CD-mixed, including both individuals with ODD\/CD-only and individuals with ODD\/CD+ADHD, and (3) ODD\/CD+ADHD, including only individuals classifying for both ODD\/CD and ADHD. We included a total of 10 ODD\/CD-only studies (7 structural, 3 functional), 14 ODD\/CD-mixed studies (9 structural, 5 functional), and 5 ODD\/CD+ADHD studies (1 structural, 4 functional). By differentiating between these three samples, it was possible to discern whether an abnormality was related to ODD\/CD and not confounded by comorbid ADHD, which would be suggested when an abnormality is found in an ODD\/CD-only sample. Alternatively, when an abnormality is found in an ODD\/CD-mixed or ODD\/CD+ADHD sample, it may be possible that the abnormality is also related to comorbid ADHD. Therefore, results are discussed separately for ODD\/CD-only samples versus controls and for ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD samples versus controls. When included in a study, results from additional comparisons with an ADHD-only sample were provided. \n\nThe section on structural neuroimaging findings reports all brain areas, not distinguishing between hot and cool EF. The section on functional neuroimaging findings is divided in two parts: the first part is focused on hot EF and the second part is focused on cool EF. Classification of studies as hot or cool was done in line with the literature. Two authors independently inspected the task characteristics and the reported contrasts for each study and judged these as assessing either hot or cool EF. In case of disagreement, the third author was consulted, resulting in full agreement on all studies. One study (Rubia et al.  ) targeted both hot and cool EF and we therefore discussed this study in both parts of the fMRI results. After presentation of the meta-analytic and narrative results of the structural and functional studies, findings are integrated for structural and functional studies in order to provide an overview of all relevant literature and resulting conclusions in terms of hot and cool EF related brain areas. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis: Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nFor the quantitative meta-analysis, an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was performed using the Brainmap GingerALE software package (Eickhoff et al.  ,  ; Laird et al.  ). For the ALE meta-analysis to be reliable, the minimum number of studies to be included is five ( ). The algorithm used by GingerALE applies a random-effects approach to identify anatomical locations for which effects are observed most consistently, and which renders it robust for the possible effects of publication bias (Fox et al.  ). Analyses were performed separately for the structural and the functional studies, and for the functional studies these were performed separately for studies on hot and on cool EF. Studies eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis were additionally required to report x\/y\/z coordinates for clusters showing group differences in volume (structural MRI) or activity (functional MRI) in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space. \n\nAll coordinates originally reported in MNI space were normalised to Talairach space using Lancaster\u2019s Transform; coordinates which were already in Talairach space were converted back to MNI coordinates and subsequently normalised to Talairach space using Lancaster\u2019s Transform, to account for divergent analyses procedures and minimise differences in coordinates between studies (Lancaster et al.  ; Laird et al.  ). The 2.3.1 version of GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ) was applied in the current study and used the coordinates of the reported voxels of each study, referring to the areas that showed a group difference, as a probability distribution to create an ALE distribution map (Turkeltaub et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ,  ). Results across studies were aggregated by GingerALE, and modelled activation maps were generated by calculating the probability that a particular voxel was activated as the union of probabilities for that voxel across studies. The contribution of each study to the meta-analytic result was weighted using the study\u2019s sample size, by widening the Gaussian distribution for a voxel with smaller samples to compensate for spatial uncertainty. Meta-analytic maps were generated by combining all the modelled activations maps, and were subsequently corrected for multiple comparisons using Family Wise Error correction. This ensured that differences between studies in terms of the number of areas showing significant group differences (e.g., due to applying a lower statistical threshold), did not influence the combined ALE map (Turkeltaub et al.  ). This combined ALE map was then compared to a map from a null distribution with the same number of foci, but now randomly placed throughout the grey matter of the brain. After this, the final ALE map was thresholded at   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons, and a minimum cluster size of 100\u00a0mm  (see  ). \n\nBoth studies using a region of interest (ROI) approach, thus a hypothesis driven pre-selection of specific brain areas, and studies using a whole brain analyses (WBA) approach, thus studying the entire brain, were included in this review. To test the possibility that studies using an ROI approach might bias meta-analytic results due to less stringent statistical criteria, the resulting map of all studies (using both WBA and ROI approach) was compared to the resulting map from studies with a WBA approach. When differences between the maps were present, results from the map including only the WBA studies were reported. The ALE map was overlaid onto a Talairach anatomical template for visualisation purposes, and the areas reported in our Results section refer to the locations of the extrema. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nResults of the reviewed studies are discussed in two main sections with the first section summarising the structural neuroimaging findings and the second section summarising the functional neuroimaging findings. Both sections start with a general overview of all included studies, after which the results from the meta-analysis are reported, followed by the results from the narrative review. The narrative parts contain a summary of the main findings for ODD\/CD-only groups first since those are not biased by comorbid ADHD, followed by the main findings in ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD groups, and ends with the correlational findings and the specificity of findings regarding ODD\/CD. \n\nAfter presentation of the meta-analytic and narrative results of the structural and functional studies, structural and functional findings are integrated in order to provide an overview of all relevant literature and resulting conclusions in terms of hot and cool EF related brain areas. Since an ALE meta-analysis cannot include studies that reported on non-significant group differences, but rather identifies anatomical locations for which effects are observed most consistently, findings from the ALE meta-analysis are combined with the results of the narrative review to provide a comprehensive and balanced overview of available evidence. \n\n### Structural Neuroimaging Findings \n  \n#### General Overview \n  \nTable   shows a total of 12 studies that investigated structural differences in individuals with ODD\/CD-only (three studies), ODD\/CD-mixed (five studies), or ODD\/CD+ADHD (four studies) compared to controls. All 12 studies used WBA to investigate regional brain differences, while three studies additionally used an ROI approach (Fairchild et al.  ,  ; Sterzer et al.  ). Two of these studies also reported on results of contrasts between ODD\/CD (with and without comorbid ADHD) and ADHD-only. In addition, seven studies investigated the association between brain region volumes and symptom counts of ODD\/CD (Sterzer et al.  ; Huebner et al.  ; Fahim et al.  ; Fairchild et al.  ,  ; Stevens and Haney-Caron  ; Michalska et al.  ).   \nSummary of study characteristics and results for structural imaging \n  \nGroups did not differ in terms of gender, IQ, or socioeconomic status, unless stated otherwise.   ADHD   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder;   CD   Conduct Disorder; N\/A not applicable;   ns   no significant results are reported for this region;   ODD   Oppositional Defiant Disorder;   ROI   region of interest;   VBM   voxel-based morphometry \n\nIncluded no data on medication-use or did not adjust for effects of medication-use \n\nGroups differed on IQ, or included no data on IQ \n\nParticipants withheld stimulant medication for >24\u00a0h prior to scanning \n\nResults included in ALE analysis \n\nGroups differed on socio-economic status \n  \n\nAll studies investigated children\/adolescents. For information regarding group and study characteristics of the included studies, see Table  . Reported differences in brain structures are bilateral, unless reported to be either left or right sided. Results are reported from WBA approaches, unless specified to be the result of ROI based analyses, see Table  . \n\n\n#### Structural ALE Meta-analysis \n  \nEight structural studies, all using a WBA approach, reported coordinates and were included in the meta-analysis (studies marked with   in Table  ). Due to the limited number of studies in ODD\/CD-only (three studies) it was not possible to perform an ALE meta-analysis on studies comparing ODD\/CD-only groups and controls (minimum number of studies required is five). Hence, the ALE meta-analysis was performed on all ODD\/CD samples, therewith including both individuals with and without comorbid ADHD. Total sample sizes for all included studies ranged between 24 and 90 individuals, adding up to a total of 415 individuals, of which 267 were patients and 148 were controls (age range 8\u201321\u00a0years). Five studies used a full male sample, two studies used a sample consisting of 71\u00a0% males and one study used a full female sample. These studies provided a total of 58 foci of grey matter volume abnormalities in individuals with ODD\/CD with and without comorbid ADHD. \n\nThe ALE analysis revealed four significant clusters of altered grey matter volumes that differed between patients and controls (see Fig.\u00a0  for visualisation). The largest cluster (760\u00a0mm ) was located in the left amygdala, with three foci inside this cluster. A second cluster (456\u00a0mm ) was found in the left insula, containing three foci. A third cluster (352\u00a0mm ) was located in the left medial\/superior frontal gyrus, containing two foci. The fourth cluster (216\u00a0mm ) was located in the right insula, containing two foci.   \nResults of the structural ALE meta-analysis showing the clusters in left amygdala, insula, and left medial\/superior frontal gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) superimposed on a structural scan in Talairach space.   Top row  : coronal view,   bottom row  : axial view.   L   Left,   R   Right \n  \n\n\n#### Narrative Review \n  \nTable   provides an overview of investigated samples and approach (WBA or ROI) and summarizes the findings of the 12 studies reporting on sMRI. Total sample sizes for all included studies ranged between 20 and 111 individuals, adding up to a total of 643 individuals, including 334 patients and 309 controls (age range 6\u201321\u00a0years). The samples consisted predominantly of males, with five studies using a full male sample, six studies using a sample largely consisting of males (ranging from 48 to 90\u00a0%), and one study using a full female sample. \n\n ODD\/CD-only   versus   controls (3 studies).   For total grey matter volume, one of three studies reported a reduction in the ODD\/CD-only group. In terms of regional grey matter volumes, abnormalities in the insula (left and bilateral), amygdala (left and bilateral), the cingulate cortex (left and paracentral), the inferior frontal gyrus (left and right), and the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex were repetitively reported (two out of three studies). \n\n ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD (9 studies).   Two of the four studies investigating total grey matter in ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD samples reported smaller volumes in the diagnostic groups, compared to controls. In accordance with results from the studies in the ODD\/CD-only group, three of the nine studies in ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD groups provided support for abnormalities in the left amygdala. Additionally, abnormal volumes were reported in the ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD groups for structures that were not found for ODD\/CD-only groups, which might indicate that these abnormalities reflect the presence of comorbid ADHD rather than ODD\/CD. These structures with smaller volumes were the temporal lobe (four out of nine studies: one left, one right, two bilateral) and the cerebellum (three out of nine studies: one left, two bilateral). \n\n Correlational findings and specificity.   A total of seven studies investigated relations between grey matter abnormalities and ODD\/CD symptoms. Three out of seven studies reported associations for the amygdala, insula and temporal cortex. The three studies that reported associations between the amygdala and ODD\/CD symptoms, showed either a positive association (thus a larger volume related to more ODD\/CD symptoms) for the amygdala in an ODD\/CD-only sample, or negative associations (thus a smaller volume related to more ODD\/CD symptoms) for the bilateral or left amygdala in ODD\/CD-mixed samples. For the insula, all three studies reported negative associations, one between the right insula and ODD\/CD symptoms in an ODD\/CD-only sample and two between the insula and ODD\/CD symptoms in ODD\/CD-mixed samples. For the three studies that found associations between the superior temporal cortex and ODD\/CD symptoms, one study reported a positive association for the superior temporal cortex in an ODD\/CD-only sample, while the other two studies reported a negative association for the right superior temporal cortex in an ODD\/CD-only sample and for the left superior temporal cortex in an ODD\/CD+ADHD sample. \n\nIn terms of specificity of abnormalities for ODD\/CD as compared to ADHD, one study reported grey matter reductions in the amygdala and frontal gyrus to be specific for ODD\/CD-only, since these were not present in the ADHD-only group. In addition, another study looked at disorder specificity by covarying for ODD\/CD in an ODD\/CD-mixed group and reported that the grey matter reductions in the amygdala turned non-significant, suggesting that these grey matter reductions were specific for ODD\/CD. \n\n\n#### Structural Summary \n  \nCombining the results from the meta-analysis and the narrative review, structural neuroimaging studies most consistently implicated abnormalities of the left amygdala, insula and left frontal gyrus in ODD\/CD. \n\n\n\n### Functional Neuroimaging Findings \n  \n#### General Overview \n  \nTables\u00a0  and   shows a total of 17 studies that investigated brain activity correlates in individuals with ODD\/CD-only (seven studies), ODD\/CD-mixed (nine studies), or ODD\/CD+ADHD (one study) compared with typically developing individuals. Of the 17 included studies, 14 conducted a WBA approach to investigate regional brain differences, of which 5 also conducted ROI analyses (S.F. White et al.  ; Finger et al.  ; Herpertz et al.  ; Passamonti et al.  ; Cohn et al.  ). In three studies only ROI analyses were reported (Gatzke-Kopp et al.  ; Marsh et al.  ; Sterzer et al.  ). Seven studies investigated the association between activity in brain areas and ODD\/CD symptom counts (A.A. Marsh et al.  ; Sterzer et al.  ; Passamonti et al.  ; Cohn et al.  ; Finger et al.  ; Rubia et al.  ,  ).   \nSummary of study characteristics and results for functional imaging \u2013 Hot EF \n  \nParticipants did not differ in terms of gender, IQ, or socioeconomic status, unless stated otherwise. The italic text describes the contrast for which the results are reported. \n\n ADHD   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder;   CD   Conduct Disorder;   N\/A   not applicable;   ODD   Oppositional Defiant Disorder;   ROI   region of interest \n\nResults included in ALE \n\nStudy included in both hot and cool EF narrative review sections \n\nGroups differed on gender \n\nGroups differed on IQ measures \n\nParticipants withheld stimulant medication for >24\u00a0h prior to scanning procedure, or did not use medication \n\nParticipants did not withheld stimulant medication, but additional analysis did not show an effect of medication use on outcome measures \n\nGroups differed on socio-economic status \n    \nSummary of Study Characteristics and Results for Functional Imaging \u2013 Cool EF \n  \nParticipants did not differ in terms of gender, IQ, or socioeconomic status, unless stated otherwise. The italic text describes the contrast for which the results are reported. \n\n ADHD   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder;   CD   Conduct Disorder;   N\/A   not applicable;   ODD   Oppositional Defiant Disorder;   ROI   region of interest \n\nStudy included in both hot and cool EF narrative review sections \n\nParticipants withheld stimulant medication for >24\u00a0h prior to scanning procedure, or did not use medication \n  \n\nWe reviewed the studies using the framework of hot and cool EF in ODD\/CD, which resulted in 13 studies in the hot EF section and 5 studies in the cool EF section, of which 1 study appeared in both sections (Rubia et al.  ). The 13 studies in the hot EF section included groups with ODD\/CD-only (three studies), ODD\/CD-mixed (nine studies) or ODD\/CD+ADHD (one study). In all studies, these groups were compared with a typically developing group and in four studies these groups were additionally compared with an ADHD-only group (Finger et al.  ; Herpertz et al.  ; Marsh et al.  ; Rubia et al.  ). The five studies in the cool EF section only included individuals with ODD\/CD-only that were compared to a typically developing group and in four of the studies the ODD\/CD-only group was additionally compared with an ADHD-only group (Rubia et al.  ,  ,  ,  ). Because four of the five cool EF studies were published by the same research group and included largely overlapping samples (Rubia et al.  ,  ,  ,  ), we did not perform an ALE meta-analysis on cool EF fMRI studies in ODD\/CD as at least five independent samples are required for this analysis ( ). \n\nAll studies investigated children\/adolescents. For information regarding group characteristics of the included samples, see Tables\u00a0  and  . Reported differences in brain structures are bilateral, unless reported to be either left or right sided. Results are reported from WBA approaches, unless specified to be the result of ROI based analyses, see Tables\u00a0  and  . \n\n\n#### Hot EF \u2013 ALE Meta-analysis \n  \nThirteen functional neuroimaging studies of hot EF were initially included in the meta-analysis. Due to the limited number of studies in ODD\/CD-only (three studies) it was not possible to perform an ALE meta-analysis on studies comparing ODD\/CD-only groups and controls, thus the ALE meta-analysis was performed on all ODD\/CD samples, therewith including both individuals with and without comorbid ADHD. \n\nThere was a difference between the resulting maps of the ALE analysis with and without the ROI-only studies. Therefore, we reported the results from the map that included only WBA approach-based studies given the unbiased results. Total sample sizes for all included studies ranged between 30 and 75 individuals, adding up to a total of 423 subjects, of which 256 were patients and 167 were controls (age range 9\u201321\u00a0years). Three studies assessed a full male sample and six studies assessed a sample largely consisting of males (ranging from 56 to 79\u00a0%). The studies reported on different tasks associated with hot EF functions: three studies assessed processing of contingencies, two studies assessed passive viewing of emotional pictures, two studies assessed passive avoidance learning, one study assessed active viewing and rating of painful situations, and one study assessed implicit emotional processing. \n\nThe included studies provided a total of 68 foci of areas showing altered activity in individuals with ODD\/CD with and without comorbid ADHD. The ALE analysis revealed five significant clusters representing areas with altered activity in patients with ODD\/CD-only or ODD\/CD+ADHD that were most consistently reported across the studies (see Fig.\u00a0  for visualisation). The largest cluster (416\u00a0mm ) was located in the right globus pallidus, with two foci inside this cluster. The second (328\u00a0mm ) and third (256\u00a0mm ) clusters were located in the right and left amygdala, and contained three and two foci, respectively. The fourth cluster (208\u00a0mm ) was present in the left caudate, while the fifth cluster (200\u00a0mm ) was located in the left fusiform gyrus, both contained two foci.   \nResults of the functional ALE meta-analysis of hot EF showing the clusters in right globus pallidus, bilateral amygdala, left caudate, and left fusiform gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) superimposed on a structural scan in Talairach space.

Sample sizes ranged between 27 and 75 individuals, adding up to a total of 560 individuals, including 334 patients and 226 controls (age range 9\u201321\u00a0years). The samples consisted predominantly of males, with five studies using a full male sample, and the other eight studies using a sample largely consisting of males (ranging from 56 to 82\u00a0%). The studies reported on different tasks associated with hot EF functions: five studies assessed processing of contingencies, three studies assessed passive viewing of emotional pictures, two studies assessed passive avoidance learning, one study assessed active viewing and rating of painful situations, one study assessed implicit emotional processing, and one study assessed interference control with emotional stimuli. Of the 13 studies, 10 used a WBA approach and 3 only an ROI approach, resulting in different numbers of studies per investigated structure. \n\n ODD\/CD-only   versus   controls (3 studies).   Two of the three studies reported abnormalities for ODD\/CD-only compared to controls, of which one study reported lower activity in the right striatum, left amygdala, right insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and left medial and superior frontal gyrus, and the other study reported lower activity in the right lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex. \n\n ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD (10 studies).   Studies assessing ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD groups replicated findings of abnormal function of the striatum (six out of eight studies: three left, two right, one bilateral), including the caudate and putamen, and the amygdala (six out of nine studies: two left, two right, two bilateral). Additionally, functional abnormalities were reported in ODD\/CD-mixed groups for the parietal cortex (three out of seven studies: two right, one left), which was not found for ODD\/CD-only groups. This might indicate that the abnormal activity in the parietal cortex reflects the presence of comorbid ADHD rather than ODD\/CD. \n\n Correlational findings and specificity.   Five studies investigated relations between activity of specific structures and ODD\/CD related symptoms. All five studies reported negative associations (thus a smaller volume related to more ODD\/CD symptoms) between amygdala activity and ODD\/CD related symptoms, one for an ODD\/CD-only sample (left) and four for ODD\/CD-mixed samples (two left, one right, one bilateral). Furthermore, two of the five studies reported negative associations between left and right anterior cingulate cortex activity and ODD\/CD related symptoms, of which one assessed an ODD\/CD-only sample and the other assessed an ODD\/CD-mixed sample, respectively. \n\nIn terms of specificity, four studies investigated disorder specificity of the abnormalities compared to ADHD-only groups. Of these four studies, one study reported the lower activity in the orbitofrontal cortex in an ODD\/CD-only group to be disorder specific, while the other study reported lower activity in the amygdala in an ODD\/CD-mixed group to be disorder specific. \n\n\n#### Hot EF \u2013 Summary \n  \nCombining the results from the meta-analysis and the narrative review, hot EF functional neuroimaging studies most consistently implicated abnormalities of the amygdala and insula. Even though the meta-analysis implicated the left fusiform gyrus in ODD\/CD, the narrative reviews did not show support for abnormalities in this area in ODD\/CD. \n\n\n#### Cool EF \u2013 Narrative Review \n  \nTables\u00a0  and   provides an overview of investigated samples and approach (WBA or ROI) and summarizes the findings of the five included studies reporting on cool EF. Sample sizes ranged between 21 and 53 individuals, with all studies assessing full male samples (age rang 9\u201317\u00a0years). The studies reported on different tasks associated with cool EF functions: one study assessed inhibitory control, one study assessed interference control, one study assessed attention allocation, one study assessed continuous performance, and one study assessed cognitive flexibility. \n\n ODD\/CD-only   versus   controls (5 studies).   Four of the five studies reported less activation in the precuneus of ODD\/CD-only groups, with two studies reporting the left precuneus, one the bilateral precuneus, and one the right precuneus. Furthermore, two of the five studies reported lower activity of the right insula, right anterior cingulate and right posterior cingulate cortex in ODD\/CD-only. \n\n Correlational findings and specificity.   Two studies investigated relations between activity of specific structures and ODD\/CD related symptoms, of which one reported a negative association between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ODD\/CD related symptoms and the other reported no associations. In terms of specificity, four studies investigated disorder specificity of the abnormalities for ODD\/CD as compared to ADHD-only. One of these four studies reported abnormal activity in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus to be specific for ODD\/CD-only, while another study reported specificity for lower activity in the left parietal-temporal cluster and the right parietal lobe. \n\n\n#### Cool EF \u2013 Summary \n  \nThe number of available studies into cool EF did not allow a meta-analysis to be conducted. Based on the narrative review, abnormalities in the precuneus were most consistently implicated in ODD\/CD. \n\n\n\n### Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative Review Findings \n  \nIn order to determine which hot and cool EF related brain areas are implicated in ODD\/CD, findings from both sMRI and fMRI meta-analyses as well as from the narrative reviews are integrated. Since the meta-analyses provide the strongest evidence for the convergence of findings, the main findings of the meta-analyses are discussed first. Second, findings from ODD\/CD-only studies (10) are discussed, since these are not biased by comorbid ADHD, followed by findings from the ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD studies (19). Finally, all these findings are integrated, resulting in an overall conclusion for neuroanatomical abnormalities related to ODD\/CD. \n\nTable   provides an overview and integration of all reported abnormalities. For the overall conclusion, priority was given to results from the ALE meta-analyses, since these provide the most objective and strong evidence for abnormalities of a certain structure. Qualifications used in the overall conclusion encompassed \u2018strong evidence\u2019, \u2018some evidence\u2019, \u2018weak evidence\u2019 and \u2018no evidence\u2019. For the qualification of \u2018strong evidence\u2019, the structure had to be reported in both of the ALE meta-analyses. Alternatively, the structure had to be reported in either one of the ALE meta-analyses, while being supported by at least half of the studies included in the narrative reviews (structural and functional) that investigated that structure. For the qualifications of \u2018some evidence\u2019 and \u2018weak evidence\u2019 at least a quarter of the studies included in the narrative review (structural and functional) that investigated that structure had to report abnormalities, while for \u2018some evidence\u2019 the reported abnormality needed additional support of one of the ALE meta-analyses. Finally, when less than a quarter of the studies that investigated that structure reported abnormalities, it was concluded that there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 for involvement of that structure in ODD\/CD.   \nOverview of All Reported Structures and Meta-analytic and Narrative Review Findings \n  \nFirst column with results shows the meta-analytical results, second column shows results from studies using ODD\/CD-only samples, third column shows results from studies using ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD samples, last column shows overall conclusion. For the second and third columns the numbers in the columns refer to the numbers of studies showing significant results for this structure, numbers in superscript refer to the reviewed studies in Table   (structural studies) or Tables\u00a0  and   (functional studies). For the overall conclusion on involvement of structures in ODD\/CD, three qualifications were used: strong evidence, some evidence, weak evidence, and no evidence. The qualification strong evidence was used if a structure was found involved in ODD\/CD (1) in both meta-analyses OR (2) either one of the meta-analyses AND by half or more of the studies in the narrative review. The qualification some evidence was used if a structure was found involved in ODD\/CD in either one of the meta-analyses AND by a quarter or more of the studies in the narrative review. The qualification weak evidence was used if a structure was not found involved in ODD\/CD in either one of the meta-analysis, but was found in a quarter or more of the studies in the narrative review. The qualification no evidence was used if a structure was not found involved in ODD\/CD in either one of the meta-analysis, and additionally was found by less than a quarter of the studies in the narrative review.

Other hot EF related areas were only implicated in the structural (insula, left frontal gyrus) or functional meta-analyses (striatum, left fusiform gyrus). \n\n\n#### Narrative Review: ODD\/CD-Only Versus Controls (10 Studies) \n  \nIntegration of the structural and functional findings implicated abnormalities in several hot EF related structures for ODD\/CD, since these structures were reported in more than a quarter of the studies: the amygdala, right striatum, insula, and left frontal gyrus (see Table  ). For a range of structures there was only weak or no evidence for abnormalities in ODD\/CD (see Table   for an overview). \n\n\n#### Narrative Review: ODD\/CD-Mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD (19 Studies) \n  \nOverall, findings from the ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD groups again showed abnormalities in several hot EF related structures for ODD\/CD: the amygdala, right striatum, insula and left frontal gyrus (see Table  ). For the amygdala and right striatum at least half of the structural and functional studies investigating those structures reported abnormalities, and for the insula and left frontal gyrus more than a quarter of the structural and functional studies investigating those structures reported abnormalities. Again, there was only weak or no evidence for involvement of a range of structures (see Table   for an overview). \n\n\n#### Overall Conclusion and Specificity of Findings \n  \nIntegration of the structural and functional findings across the ODD\/CD-only, ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD samples provided strong evidence for abnormalities in structure and function of two hot EF related structures: the amygdala and the striatum (see Table  ). Additionally, there was some evidence for structural and functional abnormalities in two other hot EF related structures: the insula and the left frontal gyrus (see Table  ). \n\nFurther support for involvement of abnormalities of some of these structures in ODD\/CD was established by comparing the results from studies using ODD\/CD-only samples with the results from studies using ODD\/CD-mixed and ODD\/CD+ADHD samples to see if results were mainly driven by ODD\/CD, and reviewing the correlational and specificity findings. The involvement of the amygdala in ODD\/CD was further supported by the finding that abnormalities were mainly driven by the studies including ODD\/CD-only or ODD\/CD-mixed groups, and to a lesser extent by studies including ODD\/CD+ADHD groups. Hence, it seems that abnormalities are related to ODD\/CD and not to comorbid ADHD. Furthermore, there was strong evidence from studies on specificity of abnormalities in the amygdala for ODD\/CD as compared to ADHD-only, and there was strong evidence for an association between both amygdala structure and function and ODD\/CD related symptoms. Similar evidence was reported for the insula, where again the results were mainly driven by studies including ODD\/CD-only or ODD\/CD-mixed groups, rather than by studies including ODD\/CD+ADHD groups. Also, some evidence for an association between both insula structure and function and ODD\/CD related symptoms was present. For the striatum there was some evidence for an association between abnormalities in this area and ODD\/CD related symptoms. For the other areas (frontal and fusiform gyrus) there was no further supporting evidence from studies investigating specificity by comparing an ODD\/CD-only sample with an ADHD-only sample, nor did correlational approaches provide evidence for associations between abnormalities in these areas and ODD\/CD symptoms. \n\nFinally, driven by results from the cool EF section using only ODD\/CD-only samples, some evidence was found for abnormalities in a cool EF related structure in ODD\/CD: the left precuneus. However, studies that compared ODD\/CD-only samples with ADHD-only samples did not provide evidence for these abnormalities to be specific for ODD\/CD, nor did studies that assessed associations provide evidence for precuneus volume to be related to ODD\/CD symptoms. Taken together, our results show strong evidence for involvement of the amygdala and the striatum, some evidence for involvement of the insula and the frontal gyrus, and weak evidence for involvement of the precuneus in ODD\/CD. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe reviewed 29 structural and functional neuroimaging studies into hot and cool EF in ODD\/CD (with and without ADHD) and performed two meta-analyses on subsets of these studies. We hypothesized that, compared to controls, individuals with ODD\/CD (with and without ADHD) would show both structural and functional brain abnormalities in areas related to hot and cool EF. In addition, we investigated the specificity of these abnormalities by discussing results separately for studies including an ODD\/CD-only group and results from studies including an ODD\/CD-mixed or ODD\/CD+ADHD group, using a narrative approach. Furthermore, individuals with ODD\/CD were compared to individuals with ADHD. The results confirmed impairments in structure and function in most of the hypothesised hot EF related structures (i.e. amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate), and to a lesser extent results confirmed such impairments in cool EF related structures (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its subcortical connections, including the cerebellum). Impairments were mainly present as reductions in volume or reductions in activity of the structures. Some of these abnormalities were reported to be specific to ODD\/CD when compared to ADHD-only, or showed associations with ODD\/CD symptom levels. \n\nIn terms of hot EF related neuroanatomical correlates, several structures were consistently reported to be associated with ODD\/CD (with and without ADHD) compared to controls (see Table   for an overview). This pattern of findings emerged irrespective of a structural or functional approach of the study. For two areas the combination of the narrative review and meta-analyses of both structural and functional MRI studies provided strong evidence of abnormalities in ODD\/CD. These areas were the bilateral amygdala and the right striatum, including the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. In addition to these two areas, some evidence was provided for abnormalities of the bilateral insula in ODD\/CD groups. For all three areas, the majority of studies reported reductions in volume and activity in ODD\/CD with and without ADHD groups compared to controls. Furthermore, for all three areas abnormalities appeared to be mainly driven by studies including ODD\/CD-only or ODD\/CD-mixed groups, and to a lesser extent by studies including ODD\/CD+ADHD groups. Hence, it seems that ODD\/CD may drive these abnormalities, rather than ADHD. For the amygdala, this claim is supported by strong evidence for the abnormalities to be specific for ODD\/CD when compared to ADHD-only and by a significant association between abnormalities in the amygdala and ODD\/CD symptoms in both ODD\/CD-only and ODD\/CD-mixed groups. For the insula there was some evidence for specificity for ODD\/CD compared to ADHD and some evidence for an association with ODD\/CD symptoms. However, for the right striatum there was neither evidence for specificity for ODD\/CD nor for an association between ODD\/CD related symptoms. \n\nThe finding of abnormalities in brain areas related to hot EF for ODD\/CD is in line with the abnormalities observed in ODD\/CD in terms of performance on hot EF related tasks. The amygdala, striatum, insula, and frontal gyrus are implicated in emotion processing (Schumann et al.  ; Anderson and Kiehl  ), reinforcement processing (Di Martino et al.  ; Helie et al.  ; Jessup and O\u2019Doherty  ), empathy (Gu et al.  ,  ; Lamm and Singer  ), and introspection (Passamonti et al.  ; Goldberg et al.  ) in typically developing controls, respectively. There is robust support for abnormalities in emotion processing, altered reinforcement sensitivity, deficits in empathy and abnormalities in self-control in individuals with ODD\/CD (Blair  ; Byrd et al.  ; Burke et al.  ). \n\nIn terms of cool EF related neuroanatomical correlates, few significant findings emerged. Partly, this was due to the limited number of functional neuroimaging studies into cool EF in individuals with ODD\/CD. Almost all available functional studies were performed within the same sample, precluding a meta-analysis of these findings and restricting our approach to a narrative review of studies. For the left frontal gyrus some evidence for abnormalities in ODD\/CD was found. For the left precuneus weak evidence was found, however this structure was predominantly reported in studies using ODD\/CD-only groups, suggesting involvement of this structure in ODD\/CD. Future studies should confirm this claim. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for involvement of abnormalities of more typical cool EF structures, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the cerebellum in ODD\/CD. The lack of robust cerebellum-related results in ODD\/CD may be due to abnormalities in the cerebellum being more strongly related to comorbid ADHD, than to ODD\/CD itself. Some support for this interpretation was found, since structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebellum were reported mainly in studies including ODD\/CD+ADHD and ODD\/CD-mixed groups, and not so much in studies including ODD\/CD-only groups. \n\nThe absence of a significant relationship between brain areas related to cool EF and ODD\/CD is in line with the inconsistent findings on tasks assessing cool EF in this group. ODD\/CD seems to be associated with specific inhibitory-related abnormalities (Willoughby et al.  ; Giedd et al.  ; Hobson et al.  ), rather than with more general cool EF abnormalities. This is emphasised by results from studies in other cool EF related domains, such as cognitive flexibility and working memory, that showed these domains to be intact in ODD\/CD and to be associated with comorbid ADHD instead of ODD\/CD (Dawel et al.  ; Giedd et al.  ; Hobson et al.  ; Prencipe et al.  ). \n\nAlthough we have suggested that abnormalities in ODD\/CD are mainly associated with hot EF, most of the reported hot EF brain areas are also involved in cool EF (see Fig.\u00a0  for visualisation), implying an integrated model of abnormalities in both hot and cool EF, rather than a strict separation between these two. This is in line with models that propose abnormalities in both hot and cool EF circuits to underlie the behavioural characteristics of ODD\/CD, such as the model by Blair ( ). The connectivity between the structures we found to be involved in ODD\/CD (amygdala, insula, striatum, medial\/frontal gyrus, precuneus) has been extensively studied, and studies show that all these areas appear to be interconnected, albeit each to a different degree, and are found to subserve several different functions. For example, it is well established that the amygdala, as part of the limbic system, is critical for hot EF, such as the processing of emotional information. Moreover, it also modulates behavioural responses subsequent to emotionally salient information, with the regulatory process being regarded as a cool EF related process (Schumann et al.  ; Anderson and Kiehl  ). The insula is also involved in emotional information processing, and is necessary for empathic pain perception and compassion, hence referring to hot EF, but also for the integration of emotional and cognitive processes, thus referring to cool EF (Gu et al.  ,  ; Lamm and Singer  ). The striatum, specifically the dorsal part (mainly caudate and putamen), is associated with inhibitory functions as well as with reinforcement learning, and thus referring to both cool and hot EF related processes, respectively (Di Martino et al.  ; Helie et al.  ; Jessup and O\u2019Doherty  ). The medial\/superior frontal gyrus is associated with response inhibition and other cool EF functions, but also with introspection, which can be seen as a more hot EF related process (Passamonti et al.  ; Goldberg et al.  ). The precuneus, finally, is an area that is involved in reflective, self-related processing and awareness, incorporating both hot and cool EF processes (S. Zhang and Li  ). Overall, it shows that our findings of abnormalities in the five abovementioned structures may lead to impairments that show striking parallels with the behavioural characteristics of individuals with ODD\/CD, such as their difficulties in learning socially acceptable behaviour, and their tendency to contribute hostile intentions to peers in socially ambiguous situations (Byrd et al.  ; Blair  ; Burke et al.  ). This supports an integrated model of hot and cool EF abnormalities in ODD\/CD, for which the model by Blair ( ) is currently the most comprehensive and encompasses a full description of both circuits.   \nOverview of the connectivity of areas involved in ODD\/CD described in this review, based on connectivity studies in typically developing individuals (see main text). Green arrows indicate excitatory connectivity, red arrows indicate inhibitory connectivity, and arrows in both green and red indicate both excitatory and inhibitor connectivity. Red boxed areas exhibit mainly hot EF, blue boxed areas exhibit mainly cool EF, and areas boxed in both red and blue exhibit a combination of hot and cool EF \n  \n\nOur results regarding abnormalities in brain structure and function in ODD\/CD are in line with models on brain functioning of other externalising disorders for which ODD and CD are risk-factors, such as antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) or psychopathy (American Psychiatric Association  ). ASPD and psychopathy are characterised by symptoms of emotional detachment and impulsive behaviour, and the disregard for, or violation of, rights of others. The overlap in neurocognitive and behavioural abnormalities between ASPD, psychopathy and ODD\/CD, suggests that these disorders may share an underlying aetiology. A recently proposed neurocognitive model of psychopathy includes the paralimbic system as a whole, comprising both the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe (including the amygdala). A review on psychopathy reported that most consistently implicated areas were the amygdala, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, orbitofrontal cortex and adjacent (para)limbic structures (Yang and Raine  ). Furthermore, these brain areas are also implicated in ASPD (Kiehl  ; Blair  ). Since we found some of these areas to be involved in ODD\/CD, a shared aetiology with ASPD and psychopathy seems plausible. \n\n### Research Agenda \n  \nThe goal of the current review was to aggregate and integrate findings from structural and functional studies on brain anatomical aspects of ODD\/CD, to provide a complete overview of brain abnormalities associated with ODD\/CD. During this process we encountered several issues in the field. Firstly, in our meta-analysis of hot EF functional studies, different results were obtained when the analyses were conducted with and without inclusion of ROI-based studies, suggesting that ROI-based studies may bias conclusions. We therefore restricted our hot EF meta-analysis to WBA approach-based studies, given their unbiased results. Future studies investigating brain abnormalities associated with ODD\/CD should not only include ROI analyses, but would benefit from reporting (additional) whole brain analyses, rendering the results eligible to be included in a meta-analysis. In addition, because of the limited amount of studies into cool EF and the overlap in subjects in these studies, we were not able to perform a meta-analysis on these data; further research is needed in order to be able to draw firm conclusions on the possible involvement of cool EF abnormalities in ODD\/CD, particularly since evidence from behavioural studies into cool EF impairments in ODD\/CD is inconclusive. \n\nSecondly, in terms of sample characteristics, an important future direction is to study the role of callous-unemotional (CU) traits or psychopathic traits in individuals with ODD\/CD. It has been reported that children with CD and high levels of CU traits show greater abnormalities in reward sensitivity, lower responsivity to treatment by parenting strategies, and are more resistant to psychosocial intervention than those with CD and few CU traits (Byrd et al.  ). Another important issue in terms of the investigated samples is that most of the studies focussed on males, limiting generalization of current findings. This is emphasised by the differing pathways of brain development in boys and girls (Haney-Caron et al.  ), and the fact that boys and girls seem to differ in the neural characteristics of ODD\/CD (Hyatt et al.  ). For example, when comparing male and female samples with ODD\/CD-mixed, gender differences emerged for the insula (Fairchild et al.  ). Moreover, since substantial developmental changes take place during the transition from childhood to adulthood (Giedd et al.  ), studies should take developmental patterns into account. This can be achieved by adhering to smaller age ranges when including participants, but also by matching on age or using large samples that allow developmental patterns to be studied. In the majority of the included studies, participant ages ranged between 10 and 17\u00a0years, which cover a substantial time of brain development. Furthermore, since ODD and CD are childhood disorders and are referred to as APD when persisting into adulthood, our findings may not be generalizable to older individuals. \n\nThirdly, at a statistical level, future studies should be more consistent in statistical corrections and thresholding. A significant proportion of the studies did not correct for multiple comparisons or Type 1 errors, nor applied cluster thresholding. Of these, most studies using a WBA approach did report Family Wise Error or False Discovery Rate corrected results, except for three structural and four functional studies (Bussing et al.  ; Kruesi et al.  ; Fairchild et al.  ; Marsh et al.  ; Passamonti et al.  ; White et al.  ,  ). However, most of these studies did set a minimum number of >10 contiguous voxels and lowered the statistical threshold to   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 (Marsh et al.  ; White et al.  ,  ) or   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 (Passamonti et al.  ; Fairchild et al.  ), leaving only two studies that reported at an uncorrected statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05. This implies that the results of both the meta-analyses and narrative reviews are in general reliable, but should be interpreted with some caution, since especially in WBA-based studies, these statistical methods are of importance (Chumbley and Friston  ; Chumbley et al.  ; Nichols and Hayasaka  ). \n\nFourthly, future studies should look at other imaging techniques, such as DTI, to improve our knowledge on structural and functional brain abnormalities associated with ODD\/CD. Up to date, eight studies have used DTI to study abnormalities in pathways in ODD\/CD. Although there is relatively consistent evidence for involvement of the uncinate fasciculus (Wang et al.  ; Finger et al.  ; Haney-Caron et al.  ; Passamonti et al.  ; Sarkar et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ), studies largely differed in terms of the white matter structures implicated in ODD\/CD. Furthermore, while some studies report heightened DTI measures in ODD\/CD (Passamonti et al.  ; Sarkar et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ,  ), other studies report lowered DTI measures in ODD\/CD (Haney-Caron et al.  ; Wang et al.  ), or no differences at all (Finger et al.  ). In addition to integrating findings of DTI studies, future studies could look at other imaging techniques, such as resting-state fMRI and combined sMRI-fMRI studies. \n\nFinally, to advance our understanding of ODD and CD and the specificity of neural abnormalities future studies should assess well-defined and sufficiently sized samples. For example, the ideal study should at least compare ODD\/CD-only, ADHD-only, comorbid ODD\/CD+ADHD, and typically developing control groups with sufficient sample size, to investigate the possible confounding effect of comorbid ADHD. Furthermore, since there appears to be a difference in underlying mechanisms for childhood-onset and adolescent-limited ODD\/CD (Moffitt  ), future studies should differentiate between these types of ODD\/CD. Moreover, studies should include separate groups of individuals with pure ODD and pure CD, to investigate whether these disorders are indeed two ends of a spectrum or rather two separate disorders, since this is not completely evident from studies performed so far (Matthys et al.  ; Rowe et al.  ). A strict separation of the two disorders was not possible at the time of the current review, given that until the release of the DSM-5, a diagnosis of ODD was precluded when CD was present. Therefore most studies into CD did not investigate or report on ODD, possibly limiting the generalization of our findings to ODD-only and CD-only samples. In terms of ADHD comorbidity, most studies that reported on ODD\/CD did not investigate (or report on) possible comorbidity with ADHD, hence, studies investigating ODD\/CD-only samples are sparse. For this reason, we could not perform a meta-analysis on studies that compared groups with ODD\/CD-only to groups with ADHD-only. Also, it would be of great interest to investigate whether ADHD comorbidity adds abnormalities associated with ADHD to those already present due to ODD\/CD, or that ODD\/CD with comorbid ADHD is a genuinely separate disorder. Furthermore, in the current review we did not examine the impact of other common comorbidities such as anxiety or depression. This is especially important because these comorbidities are associated with abnormalities in some of the same brain areas that appear to be implicated in ODD\/CD (Sterzer et al.  ). Especially the amygdala is related to both anxiety and depressive disorder, albeit in an opposite direction, showing higher volumes, instead of the lower volumes, to be associated with ODD\/CD (Machado-de-Sousa et al.  ; Young et al.  ). Furthermore, not all studies investigated (or reported on) (past) medication use, even though in almost all studies, MRI scanning was done in individuals free of medication at the time of testing (Rubia et al.  ). Current and past mediation use should be incorporated in future studies, since this may have long-term effects on brain structure and function (Hart et al.  ; Rubia et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe reviewed 29 studies on structural and functional neuroimaging in samples with ODD\/CD with and without comorbid ADHD, and performed meta-analyses on a subset of eight structural studies and nine hot EF functional studies. Despite some limitations and heterogeneity amongst studies, results indicated that individuals with ODD\/CD primarily show abnormalities in the bilateral amygdala, bilateral insula, right striatum and left medial\/superior frontal gyrus as well as the left precuneus. Evidence of involvement of these areas was present in both structural and functional studies, and irrespective of whether the study included individuals with ODD\/CD-only or with ODD\/CD with comorbid ADHD. Our results show strong evidence of specificity for abnormalities in the amygdala for ODD\/CD as compared to ADHD, and correlational studies further support the association between abnormalities in the amygdala and ODD\/CD symptoms. Besides the left precuneus that was revealed by the narrative review of cool EF, there was no evidence for abnormalities in typical cool EF related structures, such as the cerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings confirm the involvement of hot, and to a smaller extent cool EF associated brain areas in ODD\/CD, and support an integrated model of both hot and cool deficits for ODD\/CD (e.g. Blair  ). The areas found associated with ODD\/CD are involved in emotion-processing, error monitoring, self-control, and empathic and social behaviour. It is precisely these functions that are impaired in children and adolescents with ODD\/CD, and that result in difficulties learning socially accepted behaviours and reactions, attributing hostile intentions to others, and preferring aggressive solutions to social dilemmas. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4762933,"text_md5":"a5aa6568b6bf9e473e1bb30b452fe78c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,65],"journal":[66,82],"publication_year":[84,88],"title":[99,285],"keywords":[299,359],"abstract":[372,2155],"body":[2164,74405]},"batch":1,"pmid":26846227,"doi":"10.1007\/s11065-015-9315-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4762933","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4762933"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4762933\">4762933<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4762933  A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Neuroimaging in Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) Taking Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Into Account"}
{"text":"Pan, PingLei and Zhang, Yang and Liu, Yi and Zhang, He and Guan, DeNing and Xu, Yun\nSci Rep, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nAbnormalities of regional brain function in Parkinson\u2019s disease: a meta-analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThere is convincing evidence that abnormalities of regional brain function exist in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). However, many resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) have reported inconsistent results about regional spontaneous neuronal activity in PD. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis using the Seed-based   d   Mapping and several complementary analyses. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for eligible whole-brain rs-fMRI studies that measured ALFF differences between patients with PD and healthy controls published from January 1st, 2000\u2009until June 24, 2016. Eleven studies reporting 14 comparisons, comparing 421 patients and 381 healthy controls, were included. The most consistent and replicable findings in patients with PD compared with healthy controls were identified, including the decreased ALFFs in the bilateral supplementary motor areas, left putamen, left premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal gyrus, and increased ALFFs in the right inferior parietal gyrus. The altered ALFFs in these brain regions are related to motor deficits and compensation in PD, which contribute to understanding its neurobiological underpinnings and could serve as specific regions of interest for further studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder associated with progressive disability and chronic suffering that lead to a great social burden . PD is traditionally defined as a movement disorder resulting from a prominent loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, but more recently it has been demonstrated that widespread non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment and mood disorders, are also prevalent, which involve extensive brain regions . PD is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and its complex neurobiological underpinnings remain to be fully elucidated . \n\nDuring the last decade, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an established approach for exploring functional neuroanatomy   in vivo   and numerous studies have sought to unravel the key abnormalities of brain function involved in the pathophysiology of PD . Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), an index to measure changes in resting-state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals, has been shown to reflect regional spontaneous neuronal activity . ALFF has been widely used to explore regional changes of brain function in neuropsychiatric disorders . Aberrant ALFF patterns in PD have been shown to be related to motor subtypes , motor severity , disease progression , apathy , depression , and visual hallucinations . These studies indicate that PD pathophysiology is involved in widespread abnormalities of regional spontaneous neuronal activity beyond those within the motor network. Although ALFF studies have substantially enhanced our understanding of the neural substrates underlying PD, conclusions from these studies have not been entirely consistent, raising questions about their replicability and reliability. Widespread and heterogeneous ALFF abnormalities in many brain regions, such as the motor cortices, striatum, cerebellum, and brain stem, as well as frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate cortices (see  ) , were observed across studies in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls. Differences in sample size, disease severity, disease duration, medication status, and imaging methodology may partially contribute to these inconsistencies. For example, ALFF differences about effect of therapy were observed in patients with PD . Thus, to overcome the inconsistences across single ALFF studies is very timely and necessary. \n\nWe aimed at conducting a quantitative and voxel-based meta-analysis of ALFF changes in patients with PD. In addition, we set out to perform meta-regression analyses to examine the confounding effects of demographics and clinical variables on ALFF changes in PD. Furthermore, several complementary analyses of jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were performed to explore the most consistent and reliable findings. Here, we used Seed-based   d   Mapping (SDM), a well validated meta-analytic tool for coordinate-based neuroimaging data . SDM has already been applied to identify reliable brain anatomical or functional alterations in many neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease , PD , multiple sclerosis , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , depression , and others . \n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \n showed the flow diagram for inclusion\/exclusion of studies in the meta-analysis. The systematic search yielded a total of 43 relevant documents. After initially screen of the titles and abstracts, 17 ALFF studies were potentially eligible for this meta-analysis. Of these, 6 studies were excluded because of the following reasons: one was an abstract ; one used a method of regions of interest ; one applied an approach of support vector machine training ; one did not perform a direct comparison between PD patients and healthy controls ; and two just reported findings from the on-state of PD patients . The remaining 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, two studies reported both on- and off-state results, only the latter datasets were included . One study reported the baseline and follow-up findings, only the former dataset was included . Two studies reported two datasets, respectively with non-depressed and depressed PD, and only the non-depressed datasets were included . Another two studies reported two distinct  and three distinct datasets , respectively, and all of them were included. Totally, 11 original studies reporting 14 datasets were finally included in this meta-analysis . These included datasets reported ALFF differences between 421 patients with PD (232 males and 189 females; mean age\u2009=\u200959.43 years) and 381 healthy controls (216 males and 165 females; mean age\u2009=\u200959.77 years). There were no significant differences between patients with PD and healthy controls regarding age (standardized mean difference\u2009=\u20090.018; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u2009\u22120.114 to 0.151, z\u2009=\u20090.27, p\u2009=\u20090.786) or gender distribution (relative risk\u2009=\u20090.995, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.925 to 1.070, z\u2009=\u20090.14, p\u2009=\u20090.891). Quality assessment indicated that the quality of these studies was acceptable because its score of each study was no less than 18 (total score\u2009=\u200920) ( ). The demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics of each study included in this meta-analysis are summarized in  . \n\n\n### ALFF differences of the voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nAs shown in  , the voxel-wise meta-analysis identified increased ALFFs in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri, right inferior parietal gyrus, right inferior parietal gyrus, brainstem (pons extending to midbrain), and right orbitofrontal cortex in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. In contrast, decreased ALFFs were observed in the bilateral cuneus cortices, bilateral cuneus cortices, bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMAs), left putamen, left inferior parietal gyrus, and left lateral premotor cortex. The details of the results are presented in  . \n\n\n### Analyses of jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias \n  \nThe jackknife sensitivity analysis ( ) revealed that regions of ALFF differences in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri, right inferior parietal gyrus, and bilateral cuneus cortices (BAs 18, 17, and 19) were replicable in all 14 datasets. Regions of ALFF differences in the brainstem, right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral SMAs, left putamen, left inferior parietal gyrus, and left lateral premotor cortex were replicable in at least 12 datasets. While a brain region in the left cuneus cortex (BA 23) was only replicable in 10 datasets. The heterogeneity analysis revealed significant unexplained between-study variability of ALFF changes in widespread brain regions, including the left superior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal gyrus and insula, right caudate nucleus, right fusiform gyrus extending to the inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellum (lobule VI), brainstem (pons), left cerebellum (crus I), right striatum, right inferior frontal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left cuneus cortex (BA 23), right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellum (lobule IV\/V), and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ( ). In addition, publication bias examined by the Egger\u2019s test was detected in the regions of ALFF differences in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri (p\u2009<\u20090.001), brainstem (p\u2009=\u20090.046), right orbitofrontal cortex (p\u2009=\u20090.018), and bilateral cuneus cortices (p\u2009=\u20090.002). No publication bias was identified in other regions obtained from the voxel-wise meta-analysis ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nMeta-regression analysis revealed that the PD group with older mean age (available in all datasets) exhibited greater ALFFs in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri, right inferior parietal gyrus and lesser ALFFs in the bilateral cuneus cortices. Higher average H&Y stage in the PD group (available in 10 datasets) was associated with greater ALFFs in the bilateral precuneus\/PCC and right inferior parietal gyrus. Higher average UPDRS-III score in the PD group (available in all datasets) correlated with greater ALFFs in the right inferior parietal gyrus and bilateral precuneus\/PCC, and lesser ALFFs in the bilateral SMAs. Regression analysis indicated that longer mean illness duration of PD patients (available in 13 datasets) was associated with greater ALFFs in the right fusiform\/inferior temporal gyri. The results of these meta-regression analyses are listed in  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the most consistent and reliable ALFF changes in PD. Besides the main voxel-based meta-analysis, several complementary analyses, such as jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the findings. These comprehensive analyses showed that decreased ALFFs in the bilateral SMAs, left putamen, left lateral premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal gyrus and increased ALFFs in the right inferior parietal gyrus were the most consistent and reliable findings in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. Further meta-regression analyses indicated an effect of motor severity on ALFF changes in the bilateral SMAs and right inferior parietal gyrus, and illness severity on ALFF changes in the right inferior parietal gyrus. \n\nCardinal motor impairments characterize PD and dysfunction of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical motor circuits is a fundamental model implicated in its pathophysiology . Our meta-analysis consistently identified decreased ALFFs in the left putamen, bilateral SMAs, and left lateral premotor cortex. Decreased ALFFs are considered to reflect local spontaneous neuronal hypoactivity in these regions and indicate disease-related functional deficits secondary to degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system . Neuronal neurodegeneration, dopaminergic deficits, hypo-metabolism, and hypoactivation of the putamen have been convergently confirmed in PD . The putamen has dense anatomical and functional connections with motor cortical areas in normal humans . While less functional connectivity between the putamen and cortical motor areas was observed in PD patients . \n\nHypoactivity in the SMA in our meta-analysis is well in line with previous task-related and resting-state fMRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) studies  and could be modulated by dopaminergic treatment in patients with PD . However, brain activation (hypoactivity or hyperactivity) in the lateral premotor cortex has not been always consistent in task-related fMRI or PET studies . A recent meta-analysis including 24 fMRI and PET studies in PD patients with motor tasks even could not detect consistent cortical activation in the lateral premotor cortex . The activation inconsistences may attribute to task-specific recruitment of cortical motor areas or heterogeneity in task performance performed in enrolled patients. Rs-fMRI avoids any confound of variable task performance and can be easily implemented to obtain relatively stable results. The SMA is well known to play a critical role in internal motor preparation and execution , whereas the lateral premotor cortex is involved more with externally guided movements . SMA is a therapeutic target for PD management and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the SMA has been shown to be effective for improving motor symptoms . Moreover, our meta-analysis revealed that severer motor deficits in the PD group correlated with lesser ALFFs in the bilateral SMAs. Whether ALFF changes in the SMAs could serve as a prognostic imaging marker merits further investigations. Our meta-analysis together with previous studies suggests that resting-state hypoactivation in the putamen, SMA, and premotor may contribute to the cardinal motor signs underlying PD. \n\nInterestingly, the present study observed an asymmetrical activation in the inferior parietal cortex. Analysis of anatomical connectivity using probabilistic tractography shows that the rostral inferior parietal areas were predominantly connected to inferior frontal, motor, premotor, and somatosensory areas involved in higher motor functions, whereas the caudal areas are more strongly connected with posterior parietal, higher visual and temporal areas related to spatial attention and language processing . Our meta-analysis identified hypoactivation in the left rostral inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) and hyperactivation in the right caudal inferior parietal cortex (mainly BA39) with a differential functional involvement. Previous task-related fMRI or PET studies also observed abnormal activation or connectivity of the rostral inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) in patients with PD . In addition, rs-fMRI data in PD patients showed abnormal functional connectivity between the putamen and the inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) . Whereas the caudal inferior parietal cortex (BA39) is an important hub of the default mode network (DMN), which is one of the most investigated resting-state networks, involved in higher cognitive processes . Although heterogenous in the meta-analysis, other regions such as the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri, and precuneus\/PCC observed were also the components of the DMN . Tessitore   et al  . found a decreased resting-state functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe and bilateral inferior parietal cortex within the DMN even in cognitively unimpaired patients with PD . Furthermore, they showed significant positive correlations between this decreased DMN connectivity and cognitive parameters such as memory test and visuospatial scores . Regional spontaneous hyperactivation in the caudal inferior parietal cortex may reflect a compensatory way for the remote decreased functional connectivity. However, regional hyperactivation in this region may compensate more for the motor impairment in PD patients because our meta-analyses indicated that both increased motor severity and illness severity correlated with greater hyperactivation in this area. \n\nOther regions are highly heterogenous or not robust detected in the meta-analysis. Besides the unexplained between-study variability of ALFF changes in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri (BA 20), brainstem (pons and midbrain), and left cuneus cortex (BA 23), several moderator variables contributed to understanding the source of the heterogeneity. Of these, mean age in the PD group had a significant effect on the ALFF changes in the right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri (BA 20), and bilateral cuneus cortices (BAs 18 and 17). In addition, we noted that the PD group with longer mean illness duration tended to have greater ALFF changes in the right fusiform extending to the inferior temporal gyri (BA 20). We also observed that decreased ALFFs in the left cuneus cortex (BA 23) were replicable only in 10 out of the 14 datasets as revealed by the jackknife sensitivity analysis. Unlike other coordinate-based meta-analytic methods for neuroimaging data, such as the activationlikelihoodestimation  and multilevel kernel density analyses , the SDM offers comprehensive information about robustness of the findings . The present study suggests that future meta-analysis of neuroimaging data would benefit from complementary analyses to minimize the risk of false positives . \n\n### Limitations and perspectives \n  \nDespite the strengths, several limitations of the present meta-analysis should be acknowledged. First, SDM is a coordinate-based rather than an image-based meta-analytic method, which might lead to less accurate results that is also inherent to other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches . However, it is more difficult to obtain original imaging data than reported peak coordinates from original studies. Second, some potential methodological heterogeneity, such as different image analytical procedures (frequency differences, ALFF and fractional ALFF analyses)  existed across studies. We could not further conduct subgroup analyses because of the limited number of eligible studies for controlling these moderator variables. Third, the ALFF studies in our meta-analyses mainly included Chinese samples, which might limit the findings to other populations. Further studies with more efforts are warranted to apply the ALFF method to other samples. Fourth, although ALFF is thought to reflect regional spontaneous neuronal activity, its exact neurobiological basis remains to be fully elucidated . Future studies with multimodal imaging techniques and analysis approaches may provide more insights about the function-structure associations of the PD brain . \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nUsing the comprehensive meta-analytic approach, we identified the most consistent and reliable ALFF changes, including decreased ALFFs in the bilateral SMAs, left putamen, left premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal gyrus, and increased ALFFs in the right inferior parietal gyrus in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. The altered ALFFs in these brain regions may be related to motor deficits and compensation in PD, which could serve as specific regions of interest for further studies. Other highly heterogenous or not robust regions, such as right inferior temporal gyrus extending to the middle temporal, fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, brainstem (pons and midbrain), right orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral cuneus cortices merit further investigations. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Identification, selection, and quality assessment of studies \n  \nWe comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1st, 2000 and June 24, 2016 using the following keywords \u201cParkinson\u201d OR \u201cParkinson\u2019s disease\u201d, AND \u201camplitude of low frequency fluctuations\u201d OR \u201cALFF\u201d. Other resources, such as the reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were additionally identified. Studies were included if they satisfied the following conditions: (i) they were published in English as an original article in a peer-reviewed journal; (ii) they reported ALFF results at the whole-brain level for direct comparison between patients with idiopathic PD and healthy controls; (iii) they reported negative results or three-dimensional coordinates in a standardized stereotaxic space for regions with significant differences; (iv) they reported significant results using thresholds for significance corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds. In order to reduce the heterogeneity, studies were excluded if they explicitly indicated patients with PD diagnosed with comorbid neurological or psychiatric disorders (i.e., depression, visual hallucinations, or cognitive impairment) or if they only reported the on-state results. The baseline result was included if the study was longitudinal. In cases where multiple articles were identified to use the overlapped patient datasets, the one with the largest sample size and the most comprehensive information was selected. The quality of each study included in this meta-analysis was assessed according to a 20-point checklist developed for rs-fMRI studies  (see  ). Literature search, study assessment and selection, and data extraction with a standard form were independently performed by two authors (P.L.P and Y.Z.). Any discrepancies were discussed with a third researcher for a final decision (Y.L.). The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed in this study . \n\n\n\n## Data analysis \n  \n### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nThis voxel-wise meta-analysis was carried out using the SDM software package available at  . The details of the approach have been described elsewhere  First, we extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes (  t  -values) of ALFF differences between patients with PD and healthy controls from each dataset. Second, an effect-size signed map of the ALFF differences was then separately recreated for each dataset. SDM calculates both positive and negative differences between datasets in the same map . And third, the mean map was generated by voxel-wise calculation of the random-effects mean of the dataset maps, which was weighted by the sample size, intra-dataset variability, and additional between-dataset heterogeneity. Default SDM settings (full width at half maximum [FWHM]\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm, p\u2009=\u20090.005, peak height Z\u2009=\u20091, cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels), which were found to optimally balance false positives and negatives, were applied to the results . \n\n\n### Analyses of jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias \n  \nTo assess the replicability of the results, a jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed by iteratively repeating the same analysis, excluding one dataset each time . \n\nIn addition, a heterogeneity analysis was conducted using a random effects model with Q statistics to explore unexplained between-study variability in the results. These analyses were thresholded with the default SDM settings (FWHM\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm, p\u2009=\u20090.005, peak height Z\u2009=\u20091, cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels) . \n\nIn order to evaluate possible publication bias, the Stata\/SE 12.0 software for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform the Egger\u2019s test by extracting the values from the peak coordinates of the voxel-wise meta-analysis between patients with PD and healthy controls . Statistical significance was thresholded at a p-value less than 0.05. \n\nThe Stata\/SE 12.0 software was additionally used to meta-analyze mean age and gender distribution in the PD groups and control groups across studies with a random-effects model to test whether there is heterogeneity. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nMeta-regression analyses were carried out to explore the effects of age, illness severity (Hoehn and Yahr [H&Y] stage), motor severity (Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III [UPDRS-III] score), and illness duration, which could potentially influence the analytic results. P-value less than 0.0005 and cluster extent more than 10 voxels were considered statistically significant . \n\n\n\n## Additional Information \n  \n How to cite this article:   Pan, P. L.   et al  .

The single nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in ZNF804A gene is closely related to functional abnormalities of the human brain. However, these results are inconsistent. This association was verified by meta-analysis in this study. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFifteen studies on functional magnetic resonance imaging involving 1710 healthy individuals were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis used by Anisotropic Effect-Size Signed Differential Mapping software. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFunctional connectivity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC)\u2013left hippocampus in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier was significantly increased (  z   = 2.066,   p   < 0.001), while those in the rDLPFC\u2013left middle frontal gyrus (  z   = \u22121.420,   p   < 0.001) and rDLPFC\u2013right middle frontal gyrus (  z   = \u22121.298,   p   < 0.001) were significantly decreased. Neural activity of the left anterior cingulate gyrus in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier was significantly decreased (  z   = \u22122.525,   p   < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis was almost stable, and no publication bias was found. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe changes in brain function have a clear correlation with ZNF804A gene in healthy individuals, which indicate the contribution of genetic variants on brain dysfunction. \n\n\n## Registration Number \n  \nThis meta-analysis is registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42016051331). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGenome-wide association (GWA) studies have revealed that zinc finger protein 804 (ZNF804A) gene is associated with the susceptibility of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.  ZNF804A encodes a transcription factor; it is highly expressed in the brain and involved in the development and functionality of the human brain.  Carriers with risk allele in ZNF804A have higher risk for developing mental illnesses than non-carriers.  A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) named rs1344706 in ZNF804A was first identified by a previous GWA study in worldwide population.  From the studies that detected the functional effect of ZNF804A gene polymorphisms, the most reproducible result is that the risk allele A in rs1344706 is associated with the neurophenotype of mental disorders, patients\u2019 performance, and their treatment prognosis. ,  Our previous meta-analysis in Chinese population detected the relationship between rs1344706 genotype distribution and susceptibility and drug efficacy for schizophrenia and concluded that risk allele A carriers in this SNP had higher risk for schizophrenia but not for treatment efficacy.  Furthermore, another meta-analysis that included studies in worldwide population demonstrated a very strong association between the risk allele A in rs1344706 and risk for schizophrenia. \n\nThe human brain is the foundation of mental activity. Brain injury and developmental abnormalities can directly lead to the occurrence of mental disorders.  Neuroimaging studies suggest that patients with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, have certain abnormalities on brain function. ,  \u201cImaging genetics\u201d aims to detect the associations between risk genes and the changes in brain function and\/or structure of individuals with mental disorders, and to clarify the contributions of these risk genes to abnormalities in the development of the human brain. Numerous studies showed that the ZNF804A gene might be associated with brain function and structure in healthy individuals and patients with mental disorders. ,  Lencz et al verified the effects of rs1344706 in schizophrenia risk allele gene ZNF804A on neuroanatomy and neurocognitive phenotype.  Research on functional connectivity by Esslinger et al found that the risk allele in rs1344706 carrier had a significantly increased functional coupling in the right amygdala.  However, another study revealed that risk allele in rs1344706 had a negative effect on functional connectivity between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the left hippocampus.  For neural activity studies in healthy individuals, risk allele carriers exhibited a significant risk allele dose effect on neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and left temporoparietal cortex under a theory-of-mind task.  In a neural activity research based on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, the risk allele A exhibited a negative effect on the left calcarine gyrus. \n\nSeveral studies have explored the effects of risk allele in rs1344706 of ZNF804A gene on human brain functional connectivity and neural activity in healthy individuals. However, the affected brain regions and effect sizes are inconsistent due to the differences in clinical baselines and research methods. Previous brain imaging studies also have a relatively small sample size and low statistical test power. In addition, systematic conclusions to comprehensively determine the effects of risk allele A on brain function are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore these effects by signed differential mapping meta-analysis and systematic review in healthy individuals, which could further determine the important role of the SNP rs1344706 in ZNF804A gene in the development of schizophrenia. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Registration \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016051331). \n\n\n### Study Design \n  \nVoxel-based and general meta-analysis methods based on clinical data of statistical maps, peak coordinates, and statistical effect size, which were collected from previous association studies of brain function changes and ZNF804A gene rs1344706 polymorphism, were used to design the study. \n\n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 statement.  PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and Scopus were used to search for literature from January 2006 until April 2021. The following search terms were combined and used: \u201cfunctional MRI\/fMRI\/functional magnetic resonance imaging\/brain function\u201d and \u201cZNF804A\/rs1344706.\u201d Publications from conferences, monographs, theses, or reference lists in identified studies were also regarded as potential sources to be included in the systematic review. \n\n\n### Selection Criteria \n  \nThe studies that met the following criteria were included in the meta-analysis: 1) original cross-sectional research that detected the association between ZNF804A gene and brain function; 2) individuals scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the whole brain; 3) comparison of brain function among different genotypes in rs1344706 polymorphism; 4) English publication in peer-reviewed journals and monographs. Studies were excluded if they met the following criteria: 1) data were unavailable or generated from region of interest approaches; 2) repetitive publications; 3) conference papers; 4) fMRI method was not used for detection. Two researchers (LY and FX) independently performed the study search and selection. Furthermore, the citations in the included studies were searched to identify potential eligible studies. \n\n\n### Data Extraction and Literature Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (LY and SW) extracted the data. In the first screening, all eligible titles and abstracts of studies were carefully reviewed using Endnote software (EndNote X8, Thomson Corporation). The full texts of the remaining papers were evaluated for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The two reviewers independently extracted the specific information in the included articles and recorded these in detail in pre-set standard electronic form. The extracted contents were not limited to the following: 1) general information of the studies (publication year and last name of the first author); 2) characteristics of the investigated sample (sample cohort, gender, mean age, size); 3) scanning parameter, including but not limited to the full width at half maximum; 4) distribution of genotypes and alleles of rs1344706; 5) effect size and its peak coordinates of voxel-based data in brain function of statistically significant differences. If the incomplete data could not be addressed by obtaining the rest of the data from the original authors, then the study was excluded. All data were checked for internal consistency. The quality of the included studies was assessed following the checklist that focused on the clinical and demographic aspects of individual study samples and imaging-specific methodology. \n\n\n### AES-SDM Analysis \n  \nAnisotropic effect-size version of seed-based   d   mapping (AES-SDM) is a meta-analytic method for voxel-based imaging studies. It reports the peak coordinates of gray and\/or white matter differences in the whole brain. The user instructions have been described in a previous study.  Several meta-analyses on neuropsychiatric disorders were conducted by AES-SDM, including our two previous works. ,  Four researchers (FX, YH, YL, and ZC) performed the meta-analysis. The main threshold was set at uncorrected   p  <0.001 (empirically equivalent to corrected   p  <0.05) with cluster extent\u226520 voxels and   z   score>1.  Q   statistic value with a threshold of   p  <0.05 was considered to be significantly heterogeneous.  A leave-one-out jackknife method was used in the sensitivity analysis. Funnel plots were then obtained through Egger\u2019s test to evaluate the possibility of publication bias. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### General Characteristics of the Included Studies \n  \nA flowchart of the search process is presented in  .

Due to the high frequencies of rDLPFC-based seed (reported by eight studies , , , , , ), the subsequent AES-SDM analysis of brain functional connectivity mainly focused on the rDLPFC seed. In the healthy population, the functional connectivity of the rDLPFC\u2013left hippocampus in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier was significantly increased (  z  =2.066,   p  <0.001), while those in the rDLPFC\u2013left middle frontal gyrus (  z  =\u22121.420,   p  <0.001) and rDLPFC\u2013right middle frontal gyrus (  z  =\u22121.298,   p  <0.001) were significantly reduced (  and  ). Result of connectivity coupling between rDLPFC and left middle frontal gyrus had a significant heterogeneity (  p  <0.05). The area of interest with peak coordinate only reported in one study was not included in AES-SDM meta-analysis.

However, only five studies , ,  had peak coordinates. AES-SDM analyzed the effect of ZNF804A gene rs1344706 risk allele on neural activity. After data integration and image reconstruction, the neural activity of the left anterior cingulate gyrus was significantly decreased in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier of the healthy population (MNI: x=0, y=34, z=22;   z  =\u22122.525,   p  <0.001; voxels=2463), and no other brain area showed significantly increased neural activity ( ). Result of this brain region had no heterogeneity (  p  >0.05). The remaining two studies ,  had a negative result of neural activity or did not report the peak coordinates in healthy individuals ( ).   \nEffect of rs1344706 risk allele on neural activity. \n  \n\n\n### Sensitivity Analysis and Publication Bias \n  \nLeave-one-out jackknife analyses showed that most functional connectivity and neural activity results were not significantly changed. When removed the study of Esslinger,  Rasetti,  or Thurin,  respectively, the results were slightly changed ( ). Further sensitivity analysis excluded the studies of Esslinger  and Zhao  due to the potential partially duplicated sample. However, the results were not significantly changed ( ).   \nLeave One Out Jackknife Sensitivity Analysis Results \n      \nSensitivity Analysis of Function Connections Based on rDLPFC Seed Region When Removed Two Studies \n    \n\nIn addition, according to Egger\u2019s test, no publication bias was found in functional connectivity and neural activity analyses (  t  =1.410,   p  =0.208;   t  =0.05,   p  =0.963;  ).   \nPublication bias of funnel plots. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, AES-SDM was used in the meta-analysis of studies regarding the effects of risk allele in rs1344706 polymorphisms of ZNF804A gene on brain function. The AES-SDM analysis found that in healthy populations, the functional connectivity of the rDLPFC\u2013left hippocampus in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier was significantly increased, but those of the rDLPFC\u2013right middle frontal gyrus and rDLPFC\u2013left middle frontal gyrus were significantly decreased. Analysis of local activity revealed that the neural activity in this risk allele carrier was significantly decreased in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. \n\nThe outcomes of the present meta-analysis are generally consistent with previous observational studies, although some differences were observed. The connectivity couplings such as rDLPFC\u2013inferior parietal lobule, rDLPFC\u2013anterior cingulate cortex, and rDLPFC\u2013precentral gyrus was reported by other studies. , ,  However, they were not significant in our meta-analysis. Furthermore, we found that risk allele A was associated with neural activity only in the left anterior cingulate gyrus but not in rDLPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left calcarine gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex, which were reported in other studies. , ,  These differences may be due to a higher statistical powerful in our meta-analysis. Thus, relatively less regions were found to be associated with risk allele A. However, the total effect of this risk allele on brain function was never changed in our meta-analysis in healthy individuals. \n\nThe functional connectivity of the rDLPFC\u2013left hippocampus in the rs1344706 risk allele carrier was significantly increased, which showed the positive and obviously strong effect of this gene in our meta-analysis. However, in patients with chronic schizophrenia, the hippocampal\u2013prefrontal functional connectivity seemed to be reduced in the resting state, suggesting the negative effect of rs1344706 risk allele.  On the one hand, it may be due to differences in the observation indicators and clinical baselines of the included samples. On the other hand, it may be due to the difference in the races of subjects because the frequency of rs1344706 allele distribution varies widely among different populations, and this difference may directly affect the results of association studies. \n\nImaging genetic studies generally evaluate the risks of specific genes on functional development of the cerebrum. However, how the protein or nucleic acid produced by gene coding affects the execution of brain function is not clear. ZN804A is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene that is strongly supported by GWA analysis. In our meta-analysis and previous studies, rs1344706 risk allele influenced the different regions of the brain. In complementary gene expression analyses, the rs1344706 risk allele was found to be associated with increased ZNF804A exonic transcription levels in the hippocampus, medulla oblongata, occipital cortex, and other regions. ,  Hence, the effects of the risk allele on brain function may result from the different expression of ZNF804A gene in different brain regions. The dosage of ZNF804A may determine some functions of the human brain. Animal experiments, biological information analysis, and functional MRI scanning suggested that the polymorphic site of rs1344706 affects human brain functional connectivity and is related to the development of white matter circuits.  For the ZNF804A gene, studies have shown that the gene only affects the early development of the brain, but has no effect on the mature adult brain.  However, from the perspective of autopsy, the ZNF804A gene showed differential expression between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia.  These pieces of evidence indirectly or directly reveal that ZNF804A expression is associated with brain development and different phenotypes. Nevertheless, direct experimental data on the ZNF804A gene rs1344706 risk allele are still lacking to determine how brain development affects different individuals to exhibit different brain function characteristics. \n\nZNF804A is closely related to the cognitive function of the brain.  An investigation in healthy subjects showed that cortical connectivity and activation were related to rs1344706 during performance on a theory of mind task (which measures the participant\u2019s ability to infer mental state).  The regional activation of the temporoparietal cortex and rDLPFC, which are implicated in the function in theory of mind, was found to be affected by the dosage of risk allele.  Our meta-analysis conducted in healthy individuals revealed the association between ZNF804A rs1344706 allele gene expression and rDLPFC seeded functional connectivity, highlighting the key role of ZNF804A in cognitive function. One important characteristic of patients with schizophrenia is impaired cognitive function. Thus, the function of this risk gene in healthy individuals could also reflect the potential effect of rs1344706 on the abnormal cognitive function of patients with schizophrenia. \n\nNo publication bias was found in this meta-analysis, but a significant heterogeneity existed when synthesizing functional connectivity indicators. The heterogeneity most likely come from the different analytical indicators and scanning models among the including studies. In general, this study clarified the effect of ZNF804A gene rs1344706 risk allele on function through meta-analysis and provided a more in-depth reference for the study of genetic related pathogenesis of mental disorders such as schizophrenia. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe ZNF804A gene rs1344706 polymorphism has a strong correlation with brain functional connectivity and neural activity in healthy individuals. The risk allele A may be associated with abnormal or changed brain function in individuals and play a key role in the execution of brain function. This meta-analysis provides important information for the further study of genetic related mechanisms of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The relationship between the rs1344706 risk allele of ZNF804A and brain dysfunction also provides an important reference for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8449690,"text_md5":"85cdb5ff8f5fff389fb0a729d88bd935","field_positions":{"authors":[0,82],"journal":[83,107],"publication_year":[109,113],"title":[124,273],"keywords":[287,364],"abstract":[377,1875],"body":[1884,20404]},"batch":1,"pmid":34548792,"doi":"10.2147\/NDT.S322114","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8449690","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8449690"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8449690\">8449690<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8449690  Association Between ZNF804A Gene rs1344706 Polymorphism and Brain Functions in Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review and Voxel-Based Meta-Analysis"}

J. and Radua, J.\nPLoS One, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nBrain activations associated with anticipation and delivery of monetary reward: A systematic review and meta-analysis of fMRI studies\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nWhile multiple studies have examined the brain functional correlates of reward, meta-analyses have either focused on studies using the monetary incentive delay (MID) task, or have adopted a broad strategy, combining data from studies using both monetary and non-monetary reward, as probed using a wide range of tasks. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nTo meta-analyze fMRI studies that used monetary reward and in which there was a definable cue-reward contingency. Studies were limited to those using monetary reward in order to avoid potential heterogeneity from use of other rewards, especially social rewards. Studies using gambling or delay discounting tasks were excluded on the grounds that reward anticipation is not easily quantifiable. \n\n\n## Study eligibility \n  \nEnglish-language fMRI studies (i) that reported fMRI findings on healthy adults; (ii) that used monetary reward; and (iii) in which a cue that was predictive of reward was compared to a no win (or lesser win) condition. Only voxel-based studies were included; those where brain coverage was incomplete were excluded. \n\n\n## Data sources \n  \nOvid, Medline and PsycInfo, from 2000 to 2020, plus checking of review articles and meta-analyses. \n\n\n## Data synthesis \n  \nData were pooled using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI). Heterogeneity among studies was examined using the   I   statistic. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots and statistical examination of asymmetries. Moderator variables including whether the task was pre-learnt, sex distribution, amount of money won and width of smoothing kernel were examined. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nPooled data from 45 studies of reward anticipation revealed activations in the ventral striatum, the middle cingulate cortex\/supplementary motor area and the insula. Pooled data from 28 studies of reward delivery again revealed ventral striatal activation, plus cortical activations in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. There was relatively little evidence of publication bias. Among moderating variables, only whether the task was pre-learnt exerted an influence. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAccording to this meta-analysis monetary reward anticipation and delivery both activate the ventral but not the dorsal striatum, and are associated with different patterns of cortical activation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRecognition of the existence of a \u2018reward circuit\u2019 in the brain, ie a system that mediates the effects of positive reinforcement on behaviour, dates back to Olds and Milner\u2019s [ ] discovery of the rewarding properties of electrical brain stimulation. Subsequently it was shown that catecholamines were involved in the effect [ ], and then that dopamine rather than noradrenalin was the important transmitter (see [ ]). A recent important development has been Schultz\u2019s [ ] demonstration that around 75% of midbrain dopamine neurons\u2013those that give rise to the ascending \u2018mesotelencephalic\u2019 projections [ ]\u2013show a switch from tonic activity to phasic bursts consistent with their coding a reward prediction error signal [ ]. \n\nThese findings do not in themselves permit the reward system to be anatomically defined, not least because the mesotelencephalic dopamine system projects widely and in man innervates the entire cerebral cortex [ ]. Some further evidence on this question comes from animal studies, where single cell recording studies have established two main areas where firing patterns change during reward processing. One of these is the striatum, including the caudate nucleus and putamen, particularly their ventral sectors [ ,  ]. The other is the orbitofrontal cortex, where neurons that respond to various aspects of reward have been found [ ,  ]. Neurons showing reward responsiveness have, however, also been documented in a number of other brain regions, including the amygdala [ ], the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ ,  ], the anterior cingulate cortex [ ], the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the pallidum, the lateral hypothalamus, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the parietal cortex and the premotor cortex [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe other main source of evidence on the anatomical localization of the reward system comes from human functional imaging studies. Early studies using PET and fMRI found activations in a number of brain regions in response to stimuli ranging from seeing attractive faces, to viewing erotic videos, and to being administered doses of cocaine [ ] (note: throughout this article we use the term \u2018activations\u2019 for convenience, although strictly speaking what is being described are increases in blood flow\/metabolism in PET and increases in BOLD signal in fMRI). While PET findings have been heterogeneous [ \u2013 ], from the outset studies employing fMRI found a more consistent pattern involving particularly the nucleus accumbens (part of the ventral striatum), the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex [ ]. \n\nFurther work in this area has depended heavily on the development of the monetary incentive delay (MID) fMRI paradigm by Knutson and co-workers [ \u2013 ]. In this, subjects are trained on a reaction time task (eg pressing a button when they see a white square), whose difficulty is individually adjusted during a training phase so that they are successful approximately two-thirds of the time. The subjects then perform the same task in the scanner, with the reaction time stimulus (the white square) being preceded by a cue, (eg a circle) which signals that performing the task successfully will lead to a certain amount of money being won, or by a different cue (eg a triangle), which indicates that successful performance will not be followed by reward. Feedback about whether money has been won is given visually immediately after the response is made. Event-related fMRI is used to measure activations at the time of perceiving the reward predictive cue (reward anticipation or expectation) and at the moment of receiving feedback that reward has been received (reward delivery, also referred to as outcome or receipt). In some versions of the task additional information (eg horizontal lines superimposed on the cues) indicates that different amounts of money will be won on different trials. Another common variant uses a second cue which indicates that subjects will lose money if they do not successfully perform the reaction time task. \n\nIn an initial meta-analysis of studies using the MID, Knutson and Greer [ ] pooled data from 21 voxel-based fMRI studies and found evidence for activation associated with reward anticipation in the medial frontal gyrus, the nucleus accumbens, the anterior insula, the putamen and the thalamus. In this meta-analysis, it should be noted, reward anticipation was not compared against a no win baseline, but instead against anticipation of loss. More recently, Oldham et al [ ] meta-analyzed 49 voxel-based MID studies and found that reward anticipation was associated with activation in a large cluster encompassing both ventral and dorsal sectors of the striatum, the thalamus and amygdala, all bilaterally, and the midbrain. Cortical regions activated included the insula, the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, the occipital cortex and the cuneus; differently to in Knutson and Greer\u2019s [ ] meta-analysis, clusters in the medial frontal cortex were not seen. Reward delivery was associated with activation in the ventral striatum and the amygdala in 27 studies, with clusters of cortical activation in the medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex. Wilson et al [ ] had broadly similar findings for reward anticipation in a meta-analysis of 15 MID studies that utilized information from group maps provided by authors rather than peak co-ordinates; in this meta-analysis the cortical regions activated were more extensive than in Oldham et al\u2019s [ ] meta-analysis. \n\nOther meta-analyses have opted for a broader strategy, pooling data from studies using a wide range of paradigms involving anticipation and\/or delivery of monetary as well as other kinds of reward, such as juice, water, others, a smiling face, or simply knowledge of having performed the task correctly [ \u2013 ]. Clearly, broadening the range of different rewards beyond just money means that if these produce different patterns of activation, the results will be conflated. This is arguably of relatively little concern when the other rewards have innate reinforcing qualities, such as food and drink, but it is not clear that this assumption holds true when the reward is social in nature. These meta-analyses all also included studies where there was no cue-reward contingency\u2013ie there was no explicit contrast between a cue that predicts reward and one that predicts no reward (or less reward)\u2013for example, gambling and so-called delay discounting tasks, where subjects have to choose between a small certain or a larger uncertain reward. Such studies do not include one condition where a cue signals that money can be won and another where no money (or a smaller amount of money) will follow, meaning that extraction of findings for reward anticipation is either not possible or has to be inferred indirectly. \n\nA further consideration when pooling data from voxel-based reward studies is whether the whole brain is covered in the examination. Studies not covering a region will fail to find and report potential activations in that region, biasing the effect size for partially-covered brain regions towards zero. This problem applies to some, though not all studies carried out up to around 2012, after which time whole brain coverage appears to have become standard. The issue has not been addressed in existing meta-analyses. \n\nThe present meta-analysis attempted to steer a middle course between the narrow and broad meta-analytic approaches taken so far in the literature. Specifically, we restricted the analysis to studies using monetary reward in order to avoid the potential confounding factor that non-monetary (especially social) rewards might activate different brain areas than monetary reward. We also only included studies in which there was an overt monetary cue-reward contingency, ie where one cue signalled that money could be won and another that indicated that no or a lesser amount of money could be won. Finally, we excluded studies that did not employ whole brain coverage. We carried out separate meta-analyses of studies examining activations at the time of reward anticipation, ie at the time of presentation of a cue that predicted monetary reward, and of reward delivery, ie at the time of subsequent receipt of the reward. \n\nData were pooled using Seed-Based d Mapping (SDM) [ ,  ] with permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) [ \u2013 ] which has a number of advantages over other voxel-based meta-analytic methods [ ]. Specifically, previous methods have relied on an unorthodox statistical test: they aim to find those voxels whether the convergence of findings is statistically significantly higher than in other voxels. Conversely, the statistical tests in SDM-PSI aim to find those voxels whether the BOLD response is statistically significant, ie as in the standard statistical tests applied to original imaging data within SPM or FSL. The use of standard statistics has multiple additional benefits, such as taking the effect size into account (other methods do not), reporting standard estimates of between-study heterogeneity (e.g., the   I   statistic, interpreted as the percentage of variation unrelated to sampling error), and allowing standard tests for the detection of potential publication bias based on funnel plot asymmetry (for more details see [ ]). \n\n\n## Method \n  \nPapers were searched in Ovid, Medline and PsycInfo, from 2000, the year the first paper using the MID was published, to April 17th 2020. Search terms were ((\u201cfMRI\u201d AND (\u201creward\u201d OR \u201cprediction error\u201d OR \u201creinforcement learning\u201d OR \u201cmonetary incentive delay task\u201d)). Limits included abstracts and humans and yr = \"2000-Current\"). We also checked the reference lists of all papers obtained plus review articles and meta-analyses. When studies reported on overlapping samples of participants, the larger sample was used if it provided usable data. There was no protocol for the meta-analysis. For a PRISMA checklist see  . \n\nOnly published studies reported in English were included. We included voxel-based fMRI studies that (i) reported fMRI findings on healthy adults (including the healthy control groups of clinical studies and the placebo groups of drug studies); (ii) used monetary reward; and (iii) in which there was an overt cue-reward contingency and a comparison no win (or lesser win) condition. With respect to (i), studies were excluded if the samples consisted entirely of elderly (age>65) or adolescent samples (age<18), although studies where only some of the participants were over 65 or under 18 were included. With respect to (ii), we excluded studies where the participants did not actually receive money at the end of the study, although we accepted studies where they were only given a proportion of their winnings, or they received a fixed amount of money. With respect to (iii), we did not include studies where the participants simply had to choose among different strategies for winning money (ie gambling and delay discounting studies, see above). Otherwise, we defined the concept of cue broadly: it could include an arbitrary stimulus, such as a shape, a complex design or an indoor or outdoor scene. Studies were also included where the cue had an innate, non-arbitrary relationship to the reward, eg a pie chart indicating the probability of winning, or the paradigm featured of one of a number of visually distinct \u2018slot machines\u2019, or simply a visual representation of the amount that could be won on the trial; this was on the basis that in these cases a valid cue-reward predictive relationship existed even though it was obvious rather than had to be deduced by trial and error. \n\nStudies could report fMRI findings at any level of statistical significance (SDM only uses the information about peak activations to recreate a map of effect size); however, studies using small volume correction were excluded. Studies reporting findings from multiple ROIs were also excluded. As noted above, we required that the whole brain be covered in the scan; this was operationally defined as axial slices encompassing least 9.6 cm or coronal slices encompassing a minimum of 14.5cm, or alternatively an explicit statement that there was whole brain coverage. \n\nFor the meta-analysis of reward anticipation, we considered analyses where reward predictive cue activation was measured compared to a neutral, non-reward-predicting cue, or the comparison was between a high value and a low value cue, or where activation was measured as a linear correlation with cues signalling different amounts of monetary reward. However, we did not include analyses where the comparison was between a reward-predicting cue and a loss-predicting cue or where the linear correlation included monetary loss; this was because of uncertainty about whether the response to loss predicting cues would engage only the reward system and not, say, a punishment-related system. Studies where the comparison was not between monetary predictive and non-predictive cues were also excluded, eg where the comparison was between monetary reward and verbal reward. \n\nFor the meta-analysis of reward delivery, studies were included which compared activations at the time feedback was given and indicated that the subject had won or not won money. In terms of the no-win baseline condition we counted failure to receive reward both because of failure to perform the interpolated task sufficiently well, or because the preceding cue indicated no reward would be won. As in the reward anticipation meta-analysis, studies that compared reward delivery against loss delivery were not considered. \n\nData extraction was independently conducted by two members of the team (PJM and SJ), with fMRI methodological issues and discrepancies being discussed with a third (JR). In cases where a relevant analysis was carried out, but the peak activation co-ordinates in MNI or Talairach space were not given (eg because not all the co-ordinates were reported or the results were only shown in a figure), authors were contacted. \n\nFor data pooling using Seed-Based d Mapping (SDM) [ ,  ] with permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) [ \u2013 ], coordinates were first converted to a common MNI space using the Lancaster method (taking into account the small changes in MNI space between SPM and FSL, and undoing the MNI conversions conducted with the old Brett method) [ ]. Second, the map of the potential lower and upper bounds of possible effect sizes (Hedges\u2019 g) was created for each study based on the level of statistical significance, the coordinates and effect size of the reported peaks, and the anisotropic covariance between adjacent voxels [ ]. Third, multiple effect size maps (and the corresponding variance maps) were imputed voxelwise for each study, adding normal spatially correlated noise to the maximum likely effect sizes [ ]. Fourth, images of each dataset of imputed effect size maps were combined using a standard random-effects meta-analysis, and the meta-analytic maps resulting from the different imputations were combined using Rubin\u2019s rules in a single Hedges\u2019 g map and a single variance map. Finally, subject images were imputed for each study and statistical significance was assessed via permutation test of the subject images [ ]. In the text, we consider the most robust results (FWER < 0.01 in clusters of at least 100 voxels); for completeness, we also report results at a more liberal threshold (FWER < 0.05) with clusters of at least 10 voxels in the (see  ). All results are reported in MNI space and with brain regions labelled according to the AAL atlas. \n\nWe conducted tests to evaluate the robustness of the main findings. For each cluster that emerged we examined heterogeneity in the peak using the   I   statistic. While the use of   I   as an indicator of heterogeneity is not without problems [ ], researchers usually consider   I   > 50% as an indicator of significant heterogeneity. Potential publication bias was examined for the peak of each emergent cluster using funnel plots. These were visually inspected to find asymmetries in which small studies reported larger effect sizes than large studies, which could indicate that some small studies with weak of null effect sizes had not been published. We also formally tested these asymmetries conducting meta-regressions by standard error, conceptually similar to the Egger test [ ]. \n\nA number of potential moderator variables were examined using meta-regression. These were: whether or not the task was pre-learnt outside the scanner, percentage of males in the sample, the amount of money won on successful trials, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the smoothing kernel used. This last variable was included because Sacchet and Knutson [ ] found that peak activation co-ordinates in studies that used smaller spatial smoothing kernels (i.e. <6 mm FWHM) were more anterior than those identified for studies that used larger kernels (i.e. >7 mm FWHM). For reward anticipation, the probability of reward\u2013ie the probabilistic frequency with which reward would later be delivered on viewing the anticipation cue\u2013was also examined. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA flow diagram of the study selection process is shown in  . Forty-nine studies were included. Forty-seven studies provided peak activation co-ordinates for reward anticipation, of which two [ ,  ] could not be included because accompanying t- or z-score information was not available. Twenty-nine studies of reward delivery were found, with one [ ] again not being included due to non-availability of t- or z-scores. \n   Flow chart of studies considered for the meta-analysis.    \nDetails of the studies included in the two meta-analyses are shown in  .

The analysis revealed nine clusters of statistically significant voxels. The largest (5644 voxels, peak at MNI 16,6,-12 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.42) covered areas of the basal ganglia, particularly the ventral striatum extending bilaterally into the insula. It also reached small areas of the superior temporal cortex, the inferior frontal cortex bilaterally, the olfactory cortex, and the gyrus rectus, all bilaterally, and to a very small extent the amygdala. This peak did not show important between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 32%), but there was funnel plot asymmetry (meta-regression of Hedges\u2019 g by standard error p < 0.001) (for this and other funnel plots see  ). \n   Activations associated with monetary reward anticipation in 45 studies.  \nDepth of colour is proportional to the Z-value. \n     Results of the reward anticipation and delivery meta-analyses.        \nAnother large cluster (3961 voxels, peak at MNI 0,6,34 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.39) was located medially and involved predominantly the bilateral supplementary motor area and the middle cingulate cortex. It also extended to reach the superior frontal gyrus bilaterally. This peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 5%), and in this case there were no indications of publication bias (p = 0.18). \n\nAmong the smaller clusters, one (667 voxels, peak at MNI 44,-20,48 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.29) was located in the right precentral cortex. This peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 5%) or indications of publication bias (p = 0.44). Another (633 voxels, peak at MNI -20,-96,-16 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.28) was located in left inferior occipital cortex. Again, this peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 15%) or indications of publication bias (p = 0.26). Another (315 voxels, peak at MNI 38,-86,-8 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.33) was located in right inferior occipital cortex. Between-study heterogeneity was low (  I   = 24%) but there was funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.04). A further cluster (289 voxels, peak at MNI -34,-6,56 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.28) was located in the left precentral cortex. Again, the peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 17%) but there was funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.04). \n\nThree clusters were seen in the cerebellum. One (623 voxels, peak at MNI 8,-62,-14 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.3) was located mostly on the right in lobules IV\/V and VI. Between-study heterogeneity was low (  I   = 29%) but there was significant funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.03). Another (142 voxels, peak at MNI -28,-68,-32 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.25) was located on the left (crus I and lobule IV). This peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 7%) or indications of funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.58). The third (196 voxels, peak at MNI -24,-46,-30 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.26) was located in right cerebellum (lobule VI). Again, the peak did not show between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 1%) or indications of funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.49). \n\nRepeating the analysis at a lower threshold (FWER < 0.05) with clusters of at least 10 voxels led to a broadly similar pattern (see  ). The main difference was the appearance of additional small clusters (10\u201357 voxels) in the left superior temporal cortex, the left middle frontal cortex, the left insula and parts of the parietal and occipital cortex. \n\n\n### Reward delivery \n  \nThe analysis here resulted in three clusters of statistically significant voxels. The findings are shown in   and  . The largest (2830 voxels, peak at 0,46,6 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.44) was in the anterior cingulate\/medial frontal cortex bilaterally, extending to the gyrus rectus. Its peak did not show relevant between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 11%), and only a trend towards funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.05) (see  ). \n   Activations associated with monetary reward delivery in 28 studies.  \nDepth of colour is proportional to Z-value. \n  \nA second, smaller cluster (1140 voxels, peak at 0,-26,34 with Hedges\u2019 g = 0.37) involved the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. Its peak did not show significant between-study heterogeneity (  I   = 14%) and only a trend towards funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.06) (for funnel plots see  ). \n\nThe third cluster (225 voxels) was located in the right ventral striatum. This showed neither heterogeneity (  I   = 6%) nor indications of publication bias (p = 0.25) (see  ). \n\nRepeating the analysis at a lower threshold (FWER < 0.05) with clusters of at least 10 led to the appearance of a further small cluster (14 voxels) in the right angular gyrus (see  ). \n\n\n### Analysis of moderator variables \n  \n#### Reward anticipation \n  \nUsing a threshold of p = 0.01, and considering clusters with extension of 100 voxels or more, no clusters of correlation emerged with money per trial, percent trials rewarded, percent male or smoothing. A cluster of 133 voxels in the left lateral middle frontal gyrus (133 voxels, BA 46, peak activation at -28,44,26, Z = 2.44, p = 0.0001) showed a positive correlation with the use of a pre-learnt task (i.e. stronger activation when the task was pre-learnt); this region was not present in the main analysis. \n\n\n#### Reward delivery \n  \nNo clusters of correlation were seen with money per trial or percent male. As in the meta-analysis of reward anticipation, a cluster of significant positive association emerged for whether the task was pre-learnt (i.e. stronger activation when the task was pre-learnt). The cluster was in the medial prefrontal cortex (383 voxels, peak at -6,36,-14, BA 11, Z = 1.86, p = 0.001); this cluster overlapped with the medial frontal cortex cluster in the main analysis. A cluster of 183 voxels in the left lateral precentral gyrus (183 voxels, BA 6, peak activation at, peak at -48,2,34, Z = 2.5, p = 0.001) showed a positive correlation with smoothing (i.e. images with higher smoothing showed stronger activation); this region was not present in the main analysis. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis pooled data from fMRI studies using monetary reward in which there was an explicit cue:reward contingency. It found clear evidence of striatal activation, which was largely localized to the ventral striatal sector and was unilateral in the case of reward delivery. Other subcortical activations were minimal, but cortical activations were prominent\u2013in the mid-cingulate gyrus\/supplementary motor area in the case of anticipation, and in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex the case of delivery. Only reward anticipation was associated with activations outside the medial cortical surface, which were located in the bilateral insula bilaterally and and the precentral cortex. \n\nStriatal activations in our meta-analysis were strikingly restricted to the ventral striatal sector both for reward anticipation and reward delivery (in the case of anticipation, inspection of the peaks contributing to an apparent dorsal extension of the cluster revealed that the majority were actually in the thalamus or the insula). This finding stands in contrast to the findings of previous meta-analyses where a broader pattern of activation involving both the dorsal and ventral striatum has typically been found [ \u2013 ]. This was also the case in the two meta-analyses that were most similar to ours, in that they pooled data from tasks using monetary reward, specifically the MID task. Thus, Oldham et al [ ] found relatively large bilateral clusters of activation involving both the ventral and dorsal striatum during reward anticipation although the localization was more exclusively ventral during delivery. Wilson et al [ ] also found both dorsal and ventral striatal activation during anticipation (these authors did not examine delivery). Why our findings and those of previous meta-analyses differ in this respect is uncertain, though it does not seem to be a reflection of the numbers of studies included, since Oldham et al [ ] included a similar number of studies to our meta-analysis and the number of studies in Wilson et al [ ] was smaller at 15. \n\nOur finding of activation in predominantly ventral striatal regions is consistent with the widely held belief that the ventral striatum, as opposed to the dorsal striatum, has a particular role in reward processing. This view rests partly on anatomical considerations\u2013the ventral striatum forms part of a \u2018limbic\u2019 cortico-basal ganglia-cortical circuit which receives its cortical input from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala [ ], and partly on findings from single cell recording studies in animals, which have found that reward sensitive neurons are twice as frequent in the ventral than in the dorsal striatum during reward delivery [ ]. Also relevant is Schultz et al\u2019s [ ] study of midbrain dopamine neurons that signal reward prediction error; this found a greater proportion of such neurons (\u2018which occasionally reach statistical significance\u2019) in the ventral tegmental area and medial substantia nigra; these neurons project to the ventral striatum, albeit among other regions [ ]. \n\nAreas in the medial cerebral cortex were prominent among cortical regions where we found reward-associated activations. It is also noteworthy that the areas here were different for anticipation and delivery\u2013anticipation was associated with activation in a single bilateral cluster involving the mid-cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, whereas delivery activated two clusters, one in the ventromedial frontal cortex and another in the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings are similar to those of other meta-analyses. Thus, Diekhof et al [ ], Oldham et al, [ ] and Wilson et al [ ] all found a cluster (or in one case two clusters) of anticipation-associated activation in the mid-cingulate cortex\/ supplementary motor area. Diekhof et al [ ] and Oldham et al [ ] found ventromedial frontal activation in association with reward delivery, with Oldham et al [ ] additionally finding a cluster in the posterior cingulate cortex. Finally, Bartra et al [ ] found two not-dissimilarly placed clusters to ours associated with delivery in their large meta-analysis using different kinds of reward tasks. \n\nWhy the mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area might be involved in reward processing, specifically reward anticipation, is unclear. Animal studies have reported reward sensitive neurons in the the anterior cingulate cortex in rats [ ], and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in monkeys [ ], though in both cases this was at the time of delivery rather than during anticipation. In man, the mid-cingulate cortex and part of the pre-supplementary motor area are implicated in executive function or cognitive control. In particular, this region is activated by tasks requiring inhibition of prepotent responses [ ], and has been argued to undertake specifically the \u2018evaluative\u2019 as opposed to \u2018regulative\u2019 cognitive control functions, monitoring the execution of plans generated to achieve task goals and signaling when adjustments are necessary [ \u2013 ]. These findings do not establish a link with reward processing, but it is interesting to note that in a review of the evidence for the function of different regions of the medial frontal cortex, Amodio and Frith [ ] argued that its posterior and rostral zone (ie much the same area) acts to guide behaviour in terms of monitoring of the value of possible future actions. Clearly, such a function could easily encompass reward prediction. \n\nIn contrast, the ventromedial frontal cortex, one of the two medial cortex clusters activated by reward delivery in our and other meta-analyses, has a long tradition of being involved in reward processing. In particular, animal studies have identified the orbitofrontal cortex as an important region for multiple aspects of reward processing [ ,  ]; this lies adjacent to the ventromedial frontal cortex and the two regions are often considered to form a single entity on anatomical grounds [ ]. It is not clear why activation was restricted to the ventromedial frontal cortex in our meta-analysis, whereas others have found activation in both regions [ ,  ,  ], but it could be related to the fact that the two regions have different patterns of anatomical connections [ ], or alternatively to signal dropout in the orbitofrontal cortex. \n\nIn our meta-anlaysis, as in two others [ ,  ], reward deliverly also activated the posterior cingulate cortex. The functions of this region have been reviewed by Leech and Sharp [ ] and include attention, autobiographical memory and conscious awareness, but not, it should be noted, reward. The other notable feature of this region is that it, along with the medial frontal cortex, forms one of the two midline \u2018hubs\u2019 of the default mode network [ ], a set of brain regions that de-activate during performance of a wide range of attention demanding tasks. The default mode network is also known to activate in response to some tasks, whose common feature appears to be the involvement of internally oriented, non-stimulus directed thought\u2013examples include recall of autobiographical memories, imagining the future and theory of mind processes [ ,  ]. An attempt has recently been made to integrate the role of the default mode network with reward processing on theoretical grounds [ ]. However, it seems unlikely that reward is simply a further mental process that activates the default mode network: Wilson et al [ ] argued for a pattern of both default mode activations and de-activations in their meta-analyis of reward anticipation, and Martins et al [ ] found de-activations in the posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobe and medial prefrontal cortex in a meta-analysis of studies of social rewards. \n\nThe main non-medial cortical region where we found activations was the insula, which was bilaterally activated by reward anticipation, but not by delivery. Diekhof et al [ ] and Oldham et al [ ] likewise found bilateral anterior insula activation in association with anticipation but not during delivery. Liu et al [ ] found insula activation in their combined analysis of anticipation and delivery, and Bartra et al [ ] found it during their meta-analysis of reward delivery. \n\nAlthough a brain region homologous with the insula exists in primates, the wide range of functions that it has been identified with do not include reward processing [ ,  ]. Nevertheless, independent support for an role of the insula in reward comes from human studies. Seeley et al [ ] applied independent component analyses (ICA) to resting-state fMRI data in 14 healthy subjects and found evidence not only for two previously well-characterized brain networks, the executive or cognitive control network and the default mode network, but also for a network involving the anterior insula, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala, substantia nigra\/ventral tegmental area and thalamus. They [ ] and subsequently Menon and Uddin [ ] used the term \u2018salience network\u2019 to describe this set of brain regions, and hypothesized that it functioned to identify the most relevant among competing internal and extrapersonal stimuli for current behaviour. While they considered that these functions explicitly included reward, their conception of salience was broader than this, as \u2018a higher-order system for competitive, context-specific, stimulus selection and for focusing the \u2018spotlight of attention\u2019 and enhancing access to resources needed for goal-directed behavior\u2019. \n\nTwo other cortical regions we found to be activated by reward anticipation have also been found in other meta-analyses. One was the precentral cortex, also found by Oldham et al [ ], and the occipital cortex, found by Diekhof et al [ ]. As noted in the Introduction, the former of these regions, though not the latter, has been found to be sensitive to reward processing in animal studies, but beyond this, the significance of these findings has to be regarded as obscure. Also unclear is the interpretation of our finding of activations in various subregions of the cerebellum. This finding is conspicuous by its absence in most of the meta-analyses cited above; only Wilson et al [ ] found it in their meta-analysis of 15 MID studies which utilized information from individual group maps rather than peak co-ordinate. Recently, however, a direct cerebellar projection to the ventral tegmental area in mice has been discovered [ ], which the authors also implicated in reward processing at the behavioural level. \n\nThere was no clear evidence of between-study heterogeneity in any of our findings (  I   <50% for all clusters). This suggests that combining studies using the MID task with those using other monetary tasks, as we did, is a viable meta-analytic strategy. It might also imply that the methodological differences among studies (e.g., in the acquisition and processing of data) did not have important effects. On the other hand, there was evidence of publication bias affecting around half of the peaks of the clusters that emerged in our two meta-analyses. It is possible that this reflects the existence of significant numbers of studies that have gone unpublished because they found no activations associated with reward processing or in which the pattern was out of step with the existing literature. Possibly relevant to this explanation is that that the highest level of heterogeneity (p<0.001) found was in the large cluster centred on the ventral striatum in the anticipation meta-analysis, arguably the paradigmatic finding in the field. \n\nAnalysis of moderator variables was unrevealing, though in studies where the task was pre-learnt before scanning, activations tended to be stronger in both reward anticipation and delivery. This seems an intuitive result, at least for reward anticipation, given that having to establish a cue: reward contingency while being scanned will inevitably delay and\/or reduce the opportunities for a reward predictive cue to produce activations. Against such an interpretation, these associations were only seen in regions that did not emerge in the main meta-analyses. We found only minimal support for Sacchet and Knutson\u2019s [ ] suggestion that use of smaller spatial smoothing kernels could exert an influence on the pattern of activations. \n\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis finds that monetary reward anticipation and delivery are associated with partially dissociated pattern of brain activations. Anticipation activates a network of regions whose core could be considered to consist of the ventral striatum, the mid-cingulate gyrus\/supplementary motor area and the bilateral insula. Reward delivery also activates the ventral striatum, though to a smaller extent, and is otherwise associated with activations that are restricted to the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Our findings are the first to relate human reward processing specifically to the ventral striatum, something that is widely accepted from the animal literature. On the other hand, two of the cortical regions we found to be activated, the mid-cingulate cortex\/supplementary motor area by anticipation and the posterior cingulate cortex by delivery, do not as yet have clearly defined reward-related roles. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8341642,"text_md5":"770fb51c078143a3616447a814389068","field_positions":{"authors":[0,100],"journal":[101,109],"publication_year":[111,115],"title":[126,259],"keywords":[273,273],"abstract":[286,2642],"body":[2651,39843]},"batch":1,"pmid":34351957,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0255292","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8341642","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8341642"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8341642\">8341642<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8341642  Brain activations associated with anticipation and delivery of monetary reward: A systematic review and meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}

However, relatively little is known on the mechanisms of action. Acute effects on brain function can elucidate underlying neurocognitive effects. We tested methylphenidate effects relative to placebo in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during three disorder-relevant tasks in medication-na\u00efve ADHD adolescents. In addition, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the fMRI findings of acute stimulant effects on ADHD brain function. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe fMRI study compared 20 adolescents with ADHD under either placebo or methylphenidate in a randomized controlled trial while performing stop, working memory, and time discrimination tasks. The meta-analysis was conducted searching PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. Peak coordinates of clusters of significant effects of stimulant medication relative to placebo or off medication were extracted for each study. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe fMRI analysis showed that methylphenidate significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)\/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks. The meta-analysis, including 14 fMRI datasets and 212 children with ADHD, showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC\/insula activation, which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylphenidate effects alone. A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nPsychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC\/insula activation, which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD. These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical effects. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nAttention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by age-inappropriate inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity  . Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder is associated with inhibition, attention, working memory (WM), and timing deficits  ,  ,  ,  , underpinned by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) abnormalities in the underlying inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), striatal and parietal regions, and networks  ,  ,  ,  , which are also structurally abnormal  ,  ,  . \n\nPsychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, followed by dexamphetamines, are first-line pharmacologic treatment for ADHD and reduce symptoms in about 70% of patients  ,  . However, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. At therapeutic doses, methylphenidate blocks 60% to 70% of striatal dopamine transporters (DAT)  , which are abnormally low in medication-na\u00efve ADHD patients  . However, in other regions, such as frontal lobes, methylphenidate blocks 70% to 80% of norepinephrine transporters  , which reuptake both dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to increased extracellular catecholamine levels  . \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging studies of acute effects of psychostimulants reveal true underlying mechanisms of action without confounds of secondary effects of improved behavior under chronic treatment. Randomized placebo-controlled fMRI studies of acute methylphenidate effects in medication-na\u00efve ADHD boys using whole-brain image analyses found increased activation in predominantly right, but also left, IFC during tasks of sustained attention, inhibition, and time discrimination (TD)  ,  ,  ,  ; in parietal regions during sustained attention, error monitoring, and interference inhibition  ,  ,  ; the cerebellum during attention, TD, and interference inhibition  ,  ,  ; and striatum during reward and response inhibition  ,  . Studies in chronically medicated ADHD patients found that an acute clinical stimulant dose relative to off medication significantly enhanced bilateral medial frontal activation during an emotional Stroop  , deactivated cingulate default mode regions during a cognitive Stroop task  , or had no effect during WM  . Region of interest (ROI) fMRI studies focusing on frontal and striatal regions found that compared with atomoxetine and placebo, methylphenidate had no effect during WM   but significantly enhanced right IFC activation during motor inhibition   and during time discrimination together with atomoxetine  . Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in chronically medicated ADHD patients using the go\/no-go task found that an acute dose of methylphenidate in medication responders compared with off medication enhanced activation in inferior, medial frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum  ,  . \n\nGiven these relatively inconsistent findings, we aimed to provide new analyses and to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the available whole-brain fMRI studies to determine the most prominent and replicable areas modulated by acute psychostimulant treatments. Whole-brain analyses do not restrict the search volume unnecessarily and hence do not bias findings toward a priori hypothesized regions  . For this purpose, we first re-analyzed with a whole-brain analysis three of our previously published ROI analyses of methylphenidate effects relative to placebo and atomoxetine  ,  ,  , focusing on the contrast of methylphenidate versus placebo only. Second, we performed a voxel-based meta-analysis of whole-brain analysis fMRI studies on the acute effects of methylphenidate\/stimulants relative to placebo in medication-na\u00efve ADHD patients or relative to off-medication status in chronically medicated ADHD patients. Based on biochemical mechanisms of action of stimulants on frontal and striatal regions  ,  ,  ,   and findings of enhanced right IFC and basal ganglia activation with acute stimulant medication in ADHD  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , we hypothesized that these two regions would be the most prominent and replicable areas that would be modulated by psychostimulants. \n\n## Methods and Materials \n  \n### Whole-Brain Analysis of fMRI Comparison between Methylphenidate and Placebo during Stop, TD, and WM Tasks \n  \nDetailed descriptions of participant selection, tasks, and individual fMRI analyses are previously published  ,  ,   and in  . \n\nIn brief, right-handed boys with a diagnosis of hyperactive-impulsive\/inattentive combined ADHD between 10 and 17 years (19 for stop; 20 for TD and WM tasks), IQ >70, and no comorbidity except conduct disorder in two patients were scanned in a double-blind placebo-controlled design ( ) 1.5 hours after oral administration of either methylphenidate (Equasym [Shire Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, United Kingdom], .3 mg\/kg, range 5\u201320 mg), placebo (vitamin C, 50 mg), or atomoxetine (Strattera [Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, Indiana], 1 mg\/kg, range 16\u201366 mg) (not analyzed). Patients were medication-free between scans, which were 7 days apart. Functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks included a tracking stop task that measured successful and failed stop versus baseline go trials, a TD task measuring the ability to discriminate two time intervals that differed by several hundreds of milliseconds contrasted with an order judgment task, and an n-back WM task that contrasted the function of recognizing letters shown 3\/2\/1 letters back with the ability to detect a target letter (\u201cIs it X?\u201d). Twenty-nine (stop) or 20 (WM\/TD) age-matched healthy control subjects were scanned once ( ).   \nDemographic Data for Healthy Control Subjects and ADHD Patients \n    \n\nParticipants were paid \u00a350 for each visit. Written informed consent and assent were obtained and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. \n\nGradient-echo echo-planar imaging magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on a GD Sigma 3T Horizon DHx system (General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings\u2019 College London (see   for image acquisition details). \n\nWhole-brain fMRI analyses were conducted using XBAM software ( ). Individual and group-level analyses are described in detail elsewhere  ,  ,   and in  . Briefly, fMRI data were realigned to minimize motion-related artifacts and smoothed using a Gaussian filter (full-width at half maximum 8.82 mm)  . Time-series analyses of individual subject activation were performed with a wavelet-based re-sampling method  . We convolved the task epoch of each event of interest for each task (i.e., successful\/failed stop\u2013go trials for Stop; 3\/2\/1-back vs. 0-back for WM; time discrimination versus order judgment for TD), with two Poisson model functions (delays of 4 sec and 8 sec). Individual activation maps were recalculated by testing the goodness-of-fit of this convolution with the blood oxygen level-dependent time series that used the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations from the mean intensity value due to the model (fitted time series) divided by the sum of squares due to the residuals (original time series minus model time series). This statistic, the sum of squares ratio, was used in further analyses  . Using rigid body and affine transformation, the individual maps were registered into Talairach standard space  . A group brain activation map was then produced for each medication and each experimental condition. \n\nThen, repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted with drug condition as the repeated variable (methylphenidate, placebo) for the following contrasts: successful stop\u2013go trials; failed stop\u2013go trials; TD\u2013order judgment; WM: a 2*3 factorial repeated measures design was used, with drug and WM load (1-back, 2-back; 3-back, all contrasted with 0-back) as within-subject variables. \n\nCombined voxel\/cluster tests were applied coupled with permutation testing to allow for type I error control at the cluster level  ,  . For each analysis, <1 false positive three-dimensional cluster per map was expected at   p   < .05 at the voxel-level and at cluster levels of   p   < .007 for the TD and   p   < .006 for the stop and WM tasks. \n\nTo test for potential normalization effects, ANOVAs compared performance and brain activation between ADHD boys under either drug condition with healthy control subjects. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Whole-Brain Imaging Studies of Stimulant Effects on ADHD Brain Function \n  \nA comprehensive literature search was conducted of task-related fMRI studies up to June 2013 examining the effect of methylphenidate\/other stimulants in ADHD children and adults using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus electronic search engines using keywords such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and hyperkinetic, plus fMRI, neuroimaging, and methylphenidate and stimulant. Citations within papers identified additional studies. Studies were excluded based on: 1) ROI analysis; 2) no report of coordinates; 3) no formal statistical comparison; and 4) less than 10 subjects. Meta-Analysis and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies guidelines for meta-analysis were followed  . The new whole-brain analysis of our three previously published fMRI ROI datasets  ,  ,  , comparing methylphenidate relative to placebo only, was included in the meta-analysis. \n\nFor each data set, significant peak coordinates were extracted of activation differences between 1) acute dose of methylphenidate versus placebo in medication-na\u00efve ADHD; and 2) on-medication versus off-medication in chronically medicated ADHD patients. \n\nRegional activation differences during cognitive tasks were analyzed using Effect-Size Signed Differential Mapping (ES-SDM) software ( ), a voxel-based meta-analytic approach used in previous meta-analyses of fMRI studies  ,   and described elsewhere  ,  ,  ,  ,   and briefly here. \n\nFirst, ES-SDM uses the significant peak coordinates to recreate maps of the effect size of medication condition differences in blood oxygen level-dependent response in ADHD patients for each study. For peak coordinates, the re-creation is based on converting the   t   value to Hedges effect size and then applying a normalized Gaussian kernel to the voxels close to the peak. Activations and deactivations are recreated in the same map to correctly analyze those regions with higher between-study heterogeneity. Second, studies are combined with a random effects model as in standard meta-analyses, taking into account sample size and intrastudy and between-study heterogeneity  . Finally, statistical significance is determined using standard permutation tests. Default ES-SDM thresholds were used (voxel   p   < .005), peak height   z   = 1, cluster extent = 10 voxels)  . \n\nFunnel plots were conducted to detect abnormalities such as studies reporting opposite results or publication bias. A jackknife sensitivity analysis (same analysis was repeated excluding one data at a time) established whether results were replicable. \n\nSome studies included overlapping subjects but conducted different fMRI tasks, with hence only partially repeated measures. Nevertheless, this was taken into account by estimating, for each overlapping sample, an effect-size map of the mean brain response to the different fMRI tasks and included only this map in the meta-analysis. See   for details of the estimation assuming a moderate intertask correlation (.3). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Whole-Brain Analysis of fMRI Comparison between Methylphenidate and Placebo During the Stop, TD, and WM Tasks \n  \nMultivariate ANOVAs showed no significant differences between control subjects and patients under each drug condition in the extent of maximum rotation and translation movement parameters in the three-dimensional Euclidean space for any of the tasks. Group activation maps are shown in   through   in  . \n\n#### Stop \n  \nNo group differences in performance were observed ( ). Analysis of variance showed that for successful stop-go trials, methylphenidate relative to placebo increased activation in right IFC, bordering insula and superior temporal lobe and reaching deep into caudate and rostral anterior cingulate cortex; posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)\/precuneus; left medial temporal gyrus; and left midbrain and caudate. For failed stop-go trials, methylphenidate increased activation relative to placebo in a cluster comprising right IFC, insula, and superior temporal lobe; bilateral PCC\/precuneus; and a cluster including midbrain, inferior, and medial temporal regions and cerebellum ( ;  ). Placebo elicited increased activation relative to methylphenidate in a cluster comprising dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), precentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area (SMA) for both contrasts ( ;  ). This difference, however, was due to this region being activated under placebo for the contrast of failed\/successful stop-go but deactivated under methylphenidate, i.e., more activated for go-successful\/failed stop trials (  in  ).   \nPerformance Data for Healthy Control Subjects and ADHD Patients \n      \nWhole-Brain Image Analysis Showing Differences in Activation between Methylphenidate and Placebo in ADHD Boys \n      \nIncreased (orange) and decreased (blue) activation with methylphenidate relative to placebo in adolescents with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during a tracking stop and a time discrimination task. \n  \n\n\n#### TD \n  \nMethylphenidate relative to placebo significantly decreased time discrimination errors (  F   = 4;   p   < .02) ( ). Methylphenidate increased activation relative to placebo in right IFC, insula, and putamen ( ;  ). Placebo showed no increased activation relative to methylphenidate. There was a trend-wise significant negative correlation between IFC\/insula\/putamen activation and TD errors during methylphenidate (  r   = \u2212.3,   p   < .11). \n\n\n#### WM \n  \nNo significant medication effects on performance or brain activation were observed. \n\n\n\n### Normalization Effects \n  \n#### Stop \n  \nControl subjects and patients under placebo did not differ in performance. Patients under methylphenidate, however, showed significantly shorter stop-signal reaction time than control subjects (  F   = 5.32,   p   < .026) ( ). Compared with control subjects, ADHD boys under placebo had underactivation in bilateral IFC, left middle temporal gyri\/inferior temporal gyri reaching into inferior parietal lobe, and right anterior cerebellum\/fusiform gyrus. ADHD boys under methylphenidate compared with control subjects showed reduced activation in the same left middle temporal gyri cluster (  in  ) but not in any other previously reduced activation clusters. Patients showed enhanced activation compared with control subjects in left posterior cerebellum\/PCC and in right superior temporal gyrus, reaching into posterior insula and putamen. \n\n\n#### TD \n  \nHealthy control subjects had significantly higher error rates than boys with ADHD when these were under placebo (  F   = 5,   p   < .026) but not when these were under methylphenidate (  F   = 2,   p   < .16) ( ). Compared with control subjects, boys with ADHD showed reduced activation under placebo in bilateral IFC, reaching into left insula and putamen; SMA\/ACC; and right DLPFC. A small cluster in left medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced in children with ADHD compared with control subjects. Under methylphenidate, compared with control subjects, patients with ADHD only showed reduced activation in the cluster in the ACC, but this was reduced in size and no longer included SMA (  in  ). \n\n\n#### WM \n  \nNo group effects were observed for accuracy. Control subjects compared with patients under placebo showed enhanced activation in bilateral DLPFC (  in  ). Patients had no enhanced activation compared with healthy control subjects. After methylphenidate, patients compared with control subjects showed underactivation in the same left and right DLPFC clusters. However, they showed additional, enhanced activation in a cluster comprising right superior temporal gyrus\/premotor cortex, striatum\/thalamus, and insula, reaching into the cerebellar vermis, which correlated negatively with the left DLPFC activation cluster (  r   = \u2212.5,   p   < .012) and positively with accuracy (  r   = .37,   p   < .05). \n\n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \n#### Included Studies and Characteristics \n  \nFourteen high-quality datasets, all pediatric, were included in the meta-analysis, including 212 children\/adolescents with ADHD. Ten datasets compared methylphenidate with placebo on brain function in medication-na\u00efve patients in randomized controlled designs  ,  ,  ,  , including the new whole-brain re-analyses of four ROI datasets  ,  ,   ( ) and four datasets comparing single dose effects of methylphenidate\/stimulants with off-medication in chronically medicated medication responders  ,  ,   ( ). Some papers included several tasks or task contrasts and hence more than one independent dataset. All datasets in medicated patients used a washout period of at least 24 hours before fMRI ( ).   \nWhole-Brain Analysis Based fMRI Studies Examining the Acute Effects of Stimulant Medication on Brain Function of ADHD Children and Adolescents \n      \n\n\n#### Meta-Analysis Results \n  \nChildren\/adolescents with ADHD under stimulants relative to when under placebo or off medication showed significantly increased activation in right IFC, insula, and bordering superior temporal lobe ( ;  ). To test our hypothesis that stimulants increase basal ganglia activation, which is more difficult to detect in fMRI due to their relatively small size, we explored the data using a more lenient   p   < .05. As hypothesized, an additional cluster in right putamen was observed (Talairach coordinates: 24, 13, 1; 68 voxels). We also observed a small cluster in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area: 32; Talairach coordinates: 5, 44, 1; 91 voxels) ( ).   \nResults of the Meta-Analysis of 14 Whole-Brain fMRI Studies in ADHD: Regional Differences between ADHD Patients on an Acute Dose of Psychostimulants\/Methylphenidate Relative to Placebo or Off Their Usual Clinical Dose of Psychostimulants\/Methylphenidate \n      \n (A)   Meta-analysis results in three-dimension at   p   < .005 showing brain regions of increased (red\/orange) and decreased (blue) activation after a single dose of stimulant medication in children and adolescents with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder compared with placebo\/off-medication. Relative to placebo, increased activation is shown with acute stimulant medication in right inferior prefrontal cortex extending deep into the insula and bordering superior temporal lobe and decreased activation in anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area  . (B)   Meta-analysis results in two-dimension at peak Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: 38, 18, \u22124 (corresponding to Talairach coordinates: 42, 20, \u221212) at   p   < .005, showing right inferior frontal cortex reaching into insula and anterior cingulate cortex\/supplementary motor area.   (C)   Meta-analysis results in two-dimension at peak Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: 38, 18, \u22124 (corresponding to Talairach coordinates: 42, 20, \u221212) at a more lenient   p   < .05, showing in addition a cluster in right putamen and rostral anterior cingulate. \n  \n\nWe tested whether findings remained when we included only the 10 studies in medication-na\u00efve patients that compared specifically methylphenidate versus placebo. The activation cluster in right IFC\/insula remained almost identical but became somewhat larger in size and more significant ( ). \n\nFor both analyses, a cluster in dACC\/SMA was significantly decreased in activation in patients under an acute dose of methylphenidate\/stimulants compared with placebo\/off-stimulant medication ( ). \n\n\n#### Reliability Analysis \n  \nFunnel plots showed that no studies had findings in opposite directions, and there was no detectable publication bias (Egger\u2019s test   p   > .4 in both cases). A whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that the findings on the IFC and ACC activation clusters were moderately replicable and preserved in all but four and three combinations of datasets, respectively (  in  ). \n\nResults were identical when sample overlaps were taken into account, though the peak height of right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) abnormality was only .971 (  p   < .0001). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe whole-brain analysis in 19 to 20 medication-na\u00efve ADHD boys showed that methylphenidate relative to placebo had no significant effect on brain function during WM but increased activation in right IFC\/insula during successful and failed response inhibition and TD, which trend-wise correlated with improved TD errors. Methylphenidate also enhanced activation of caudate, parietal, and temporal activation during inhibition. Placebo relative to methylphenidate increased activation in ACC\/SMA. The findings replicate and extend previous fMRI findings of methylphenidate enhancing IFG-striatal activation relative to placebo in a different ADHD cohort during the same and similar inhibition and timing tasks  ,  ,  . Furthermore, the increased right IFC\/insula activation with methylphenidate led to significant normalization of its underactivation during stop and TD in ADHD patients when compared with healthy control subjects. The meta-analysis of stimulant effects in 14 fMRI datasets, including the above data, showed that stimulants relative to placebo\/off-medication most consistently increase activation in right IFC\/insula. The finding remained for the 10 studies that tested specifically for methylphenidate effects relative to placebo in medication-na\u00efve patients. At a more lenient threshold, putamen activation was also increased, suggesting that stimulants most consistently enhance right IFC-insular-striatal activation. \n\nIt was not unexpected that methylphenidate\/stimulants most consistently increased right IFC\/insula activation relative to placebo\/off-medication, as this region has been shown to be increased in activation with methylphenidate relative to placebo in several whole-brain and ROI fMRI studies of methylphenidate effects during response inhibition  ,  ,  , interference inhibition  , sustained attention  , and time discrimination  ,   ( ,  ).   \nROI-Based Studies Examining the Acute Effects of Stimulant Medication on Brain Function of ADHD Children\/Adolescents and Adults \n    \n\nThe area of increased activation, i.e., right IFC, bordering superior temporal lobe and reaching into insula, is a key region of cognitive control, as demonstrated by meta-analyses of fMRI studies of motor, interference inhibition, and switching  ,  ,  ,  , transcranial magnetic stimulation  ,  ,  , and lesion studies  . However, right IFC is also a key region mediating time estimation  ,   and part of the ventral attention system mediating selective and sustained attention  ,  . It has therefore been argued that right IFC\/insula have a generic role of updating information   and cognitive control  , including attention allocation to behaviorally relevant salient stimuli  ,  ,  ,  . The functions mediated by IFC\/insula are also most consistently impaired in ADHD, such as cognitive control  ,  , sustained attention, saliency detection, and timing  ,  ,  , in line with consistently reduced activation in this region in ADHD during cognitive control  ,  , attention  ,  , and timing tasks  ,  ,  . \n\nThis meta-analysis therefore demonstrates that stimulants\/methylphenidate most consistently increase activation of a key region of cognitive control\/saliency detection that has consistently been found to be underactivated in ADHD patients in the context of disorder-relevant functions of inhibition, attention, and timing  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and that may be a disorder-specific neurofunctional biomarker of ADHD relative to other childhood disorders  ,  ,  ,  ,  . \n\nThe increase of IFG\/insula activation with methylphenidate is likely mediated by both noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms, given that in frontal regions both in humans  ,  ,   and in animals  ,   methylphenidate increases noradrenaline equally or more than dopamine via reuptake inhibition of noradrenaline transporters, which clear both catecholamines. The explorative analysis at a more lenient threshold revealed an additional increase in right putamen activation, in line with the key mechanism of action of methylphenidate of the blockade of over 50% of striatal DAT, leading to increased striatal dopamine release  . Caudate and putamen are dysfunctional in ADHD, together with prefrontal regions  ,  ,  ,  , suggesting that stimulants increase underfunctioning frontostriatal mechanisms in ADHD  . \n\nFurthermore, acute methylphenidate normalized the underactivation in right IFC that was observed in ADHD patients under placebo compared with healthy control subjects during inhibition and timing processes [see also  ,  ], which has also been observed previously during interference inhibition  , motor inhibition  ,  , WM  , and TD   (  in  ). Other areas were also normalized, most prominently basal ganglia underfunction during inhibitory control  ,  ,   and timing   (  in  ). \n\nWhile most fMRI studies found methylphenidate to have a positive effect on brain activation, only some studies observed performance improvement  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , likely reflecting the superior sensitivity of fMRI relative to behavior to detect pharmacologic effects or the relatively small subject numbers of fMRI studies, underpowered for performance effects. \n\nA cluster in ACC\/SMA was significantly reduced under stimulants relative to placebo\/off-medication. However, a similar cluster in our stop task analysis ( ) was partly due to increased deactivation with methylphenidate (i.e., more activation during the go condition) (  in  ), which was also observed in the ROI analysis   and other studies  ,  ,  . This could suggest an impact of methylphenidate on reducing the default mode network or of enhancing activation related to the contrast condition rather than a placebo effect. Alternatively, it is also possible that methylphenidate has differential effects on the saliency network, reducing ACC\/SMA and enhancing IFC\/insula. \n\nThis meta-analysis could only test acute stimulant effects on brain function, given the sparsity of fMRI studies that tested longer term effects. One fMRI study found a trend for ACC reduction to be more pronounced in five nonmedicated versus nine medicated children with ADHD after 1 year methylphenidate treatment, suggesting amelioration but not normalization of activation deficits in ADHD  . In 10 adults with ADHD, amelioration of dACC underactivation was found, which was associated with treatment response, as well as in right DLPFC and bilateral parietal cortices after 6 weeks OROS methylphenidate (Concerta, Addison, Texas) relative to placebo  . Meta-regression analyses on fMRI studies found that long-term stimulant medication was linearly associated with more normal basal ganglia function during attention but not inhibition tasks  . \n\nNo prospective studies are published on long-term effects of stimulant treatment on brain structure. Meta-regression analyses show that long-term stimulant medication is associated with more normal basal ganglia structure  ,  , parallel to the meta-regression findings of an association with more normal striatal function during attention tasks  . Retrospective structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comparisons found that medicated relative to unmedicated ADHD patients had more normal white matter   and cortical thinning development in left IFG, premotor, and parietal regions  ; basal ganglia morphology  ; and sizes of thalamus  , anterior cingulate  , cerebellum  , and corpus callosum  , suggesting a neuroprotective effect of stimulant medication on ADHD brain development. However, while the experimental within-patient fMRI studies are more likely to reflect causal medication effects, the retrospective structural MRI analyses could be confounded by other discriminating factors than medication status and need corroboration in prospective longitudinal within-patient MRI studies. Our meta-regression analysis of positron emission tomography studies, on the other hand, showed that long-term stimulant medication was associated with abnormally elevated striatal DAT levels  , which was also found in a prospective 1-year positron emission tomography study  ,  , suggesting brain adaptation and tolerance to long-term stimulants. Future longitudinal studies using several imaging modalities will need to assess the fundamental question of the impact of stimulant medication on the development of brain structure, function, and biochemistry of ADHD children. \n\nA key relevant clinical question is whether brain structure or function patterns in ADHD patients can predict stimulant response. A recent fMRI study found an association between clinical improvement after 6 to 8 weeks of methylphenidate and brain activation reduction over this time in motor, IFC, and ACC cortices  . Another study found that methylphenidate response in seven ADHD adolescents was associated with acute stimulant reduction effects in parietal regional homogeneity during rest  . Future larger powered studies using multivariate pattern recognition analyses are necessary to test whether baseline brain function or structure abnormalities in ADHD can predict stimulant response  . \n\nA limitation of the re-analyzed fMRI dataset is that clinical ratings from teachers were not obtained. Also, it cannot be ascertained whether stimulant effects on brain activation in ADHD have disorder or diagnostic specificity, as only one fMRI study has tested healthy control subjects under methylphenidate   and none in other childhood disorders. The meta-analysis has several limitations inherent to all meta-analyses. Peak-based meta-analyses are based on coordinates from published studies rather than raw statistical brain maps  . Also, different studies used different statistical thresholds. Third, while voxel-wise meta-analytical methods provide excellent control for false-positive results, false-negative results are more difficult to avoid  . Last, while most included fMRI studies measured cognitive control functions, there was heterogeneity, with some studies assessing motivational effects within cognitive control tasks and two studies measuring time estimation. Once more studies are available, future meta-analytic studies should subcategorize stimulant effects on homogenous cognitive domains. \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis of 14 fMRI datasets in pediatric ADHD shows that the most consistent effect of acute stimulant medication, and of methylphenidate specifically, is the increased activation of right IFC, a key region of cognitive control and the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction area of ADHD  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . It is likely that increased right IFC activation and its normalization relative to healthy control subjects  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   is underlying the clinical effectiveness of stimulant response on ADHD behaviors. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4183380,"text_md5":"b46a85602667de0eaaae055cbc72f44e","field_positions":{"authors":[0,119],"journal":[120,135],"publication_year":[137,141],"title":[152,274],"keywords":[288,346],"abstract":[359,2299],"body":[2308,33516]},"batch":1,"pmid":24314347,"doi":"10.1016\/j.biopsych.2013.10.016","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4183380","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4183380"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4183380\">4183380<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4183380  Effects of Stimulants on Brain Function in Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"}

Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments utilizing a variety of tasks have investigated the neural correlates of inhibitory control in OCD. Evidence from existing   meta  -analyses suggests aberrant activation of regions in fronto-striatal circuits during inhibitory control. However, new fMRI articles have since been published, and a more rigorous methodology for neuroimaging   meta  -analyses is now available. \n\n\n## Objectives \n  \nFirst, to reevaluate the evidence for abnormal brain activation during performance of inhibitory control tasks in OCD while adhering to current best practices for   meta  -analyses, and second, to extend previous findings by separately assessing different subprocesses of inhibitory control. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nWe systematically searched Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed and the functional BrainMap database for fMRI articles that compared activation during performance of inhibitory control tasks in patients with OCD and healthy control (HC) subjects. Thirty-five experiments from 21 articles met our criteria for inclusion. We first performed activation-likelihood-estimation   meta  -analyses to elucidate brain areas in which case-control activation differences converged across articles and tasks. We then aimed to extend previous work by separately evaluating experiments requiring inhibition of a prepotent response without execution of an alternative response (i.e., response inhibition) and experiments requiring inhibition of a prepotent response and execution of an alternative response (i.e., cognitive inhibition). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe 35 experiments included a total of 394 patients and 410 controls. We did not find evidence of abnormal brain activation in OCD during inhibitory control when pooling data from all experiments. Analysis restricted to cognitive inhibition experiments showed abnormal activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC;   P   = .04, cluster-level familywise error-corrected, cluster volume of 824\u00a0mm ). We did not have sufficient data to evaluate response inhibition experiments separately. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFindings of abnormal brain activation in OCD from different inhibitory control tasks do not appear to converge on the same brain regions, but the dACC may be implicated in abnormal cognitive inhibition. Our findings highlight a need for experiments that specifically target subprocesses of inhibitory control to achieve a more differentiated understanding of the neural correlates for impaired inhibitory control in OCD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and disabling psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 2\u00a0% to 3\u00a0% ( ). Clinically, OCD is characterized by two core symptoms: obsessions, which are recurrent, persistent and intrusive thoughts or urges (e.g., about contamination or harm), and compulsions, which are ego-dystonic, excessive and repetitive overt or mental acts (e.g., extreme hand-washing or checking rituals;  ,  ) . \n\nPoor control over obsessions and compulsions in patients with OCD has been attributed to impairments in inhibitory control ( ,  ,  ,  ). Historically, the concept of inhibition has been used to describe several different phenomena ( ). In cognitive neuroscience, inhibitory control is commonly assessed with tasks requiring control over a prepotent response tendency ( ). These tasks include Stop signal, Go\/no-go, Flanker, Simon, Stroop, Multisource interference, and Switching\/Shifting. In Stop signal and Go\/no-go, a prepotent response tendency is induced by a higher frequency of go trials than trials requiring inhibition (i.e., stop and no-go trials). Stop signal requires the cancellation of an already triggered motor response, whereas Go\/no-go requires the withholding of a prepotent go response that has not yet been initiated. Flanker, Simon, Stroop and Multisource interference requires the response to a target in the presence of interfering distractors that are associated with an alternative response. Switching\/Shifting requires the response to a target with interference from previous targets that were associated with a different response (i.e., the task to perform switches) or interference from a previously relevant feature dimension (i.e., the relevant feature to attend switches). We use the term inhibitory control to denote the neural processes underlying successful performance of these tasks. To investigate different subprocesses of inhibitory control, we also make a distinction between tasks where the participant occasionally must inhibit a pre-potent response without initiating an alternative motor response (i.e., response inhibition) and tasks where the participant, in addition to inhibiting their pre-potent motor response, must also plan and execute an alternative motor response (i.e., cognitive inhibition). \n\nPrevious task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) articles suggest that patients with OCD show abnormal brain activation during inhibitory control. However, findings from individual articles are sometimes inconsistent. For example, some articles report increased activation of the posterior medial prefrontal cortex ( ,  ), whereas other articles report decreased activation of the same area ( ,  ,  ,  ). Also, small sample sizes and methodological flexibility in processing pipelines ( )and statistical procedures ( ,  ) increase the risk of biased and context specific findings that do not generalize ( ,  ). \n\nMeta-analyses are critical to show and quantify consistencies of results from different experiments, thereby allowing for generalization beyond the experimental setup of individual articles. Previous   meta  -analyses of OCD fMRI data sets indicate abnormal activation of the rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the striatum during inhibitory control ( ,  ,  ) , and during broader executive functions ( ,  ,  ,  ). Many previous   meta  -analyses tested for convergence of reported coordinates for abnormal task-related activity in OCD using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) ( ,  ,  ,  ). However, new studies have since been published, and existing ALE   meta  -analyses do not meet the current standards for type I error control ( ). Moreover, several recent experiments have not found significant case-control differences during inhibitory control ( ,  ,  ,  ) , and recent prominent publications have sparked serious concerns over the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimaging research ( ,  ). This raises the question of whether previous   meta  -analytical findings are replicable when integrating data from new studies while adhering to contemporary recommendations for conducting   meta  -analyses. In addition, inhibitory control is not a unitary construct. Rather, inhibitory control is an umbrella term which includes dissociable subprocesses that are underpinned by distinct and only partially overlapping networks ( ,  ,  ). These networks are differentially engaged by different types of inhibitory control tasks ( ,  ). With the present review and   meta  -analyses, we reassess the evidence for abnormal activation during inhibitory control in OCD following best-practice guidelines and extend previous findings by separately evaluating response inhibition and cognitive inhibition. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nThis review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( ) and follows the best-practice recommendations for conducting coordinate-based   meta  -analyses ( ,  ). We systematically searched for eligible articles on Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, Scopus and PubMed (final search on April 28, 2022), using the search terms (\u201cocd\u201d OR \u201cobsessive compulsive disorder\u201d) AND (\u201cfmri\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d) AND (\u201cinhibitory\u201d OR \u201cinhibition\u201d OR \u201cmultisource\u201d OR \u201cconflict\u201d OR \u201ccancel\u201d OR \u201cgo\/no-go\u201d OR \u201cflanker\u201d OR \u201cstroop\u201d OR \u201cinterference\u201d OR \u201cswitching\u201d OR \u201cstop\u201d OR \u201csimon\u201d). The search strategy for each database is provided in Supplement 1. We also searched the functional BrainMap database ( ) using Sleuth version 3.0.4 ( ) within the imaging modality of \u201cfMRI\u201d, the diagnosis of \u201cObsessive Compulsive Disorder\u201d and the behavioral domain of \u201caction inhibition\u201d. We manually searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant review papers for additional articles. \n\n\n### Article selection \n  \nWe use the term \u201carticle\u201d to refer to a published manuscript and the term \u201cexperiment\u201d to denote the set of coordinates, or activation foci, relating to a single case-control contrast. Hence, one article may include more than one experiment. Two authors independently screened title\/abstract and full-texts in separate steps using a procedure optimized for the EndNote software ( ). We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We included peer-reviewed articles published in English that reported group coordinates for case-control differences in activation related to inhibitory control. We only included fMRI articles to maximize data homogeneity (e.g., by avoiding heterogeneity associated with differences in spatial and temporal resolutions between different imaging techniques). We included all relevant contrasts from inhibitory control tasks irrespective of whether the task was defined in the search terms or referred to as an inhibitory control task by the authors. The included experiments compared one of the contrasts stop, no-go, switch, shift, mixed or incongruent to one of the contrasts failed-stop, go, odd-ball, repeat or congruent. We excluded articles that did not report coordinates in either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, only presented results with interactions from non-fMRI methods (e.g. brain-behavior correlations), only presented results from a priori region of interest analysis, or did not find significant case-control differences for an inhibitory control contrast. We did not exclude articles that masked the case-control comparisons based on either task-related activity in the control group or the combined group (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or data from a   meta  -analysis of the task (n\u00a0=\u00a01) as these masks are not based on a priori assumptions about brain regions of interest. \n\n\n### Data extraction and data synthesis \n  \nOne author extracted information pertaining to sample characteristics and activation foci from full-text articles and supplementary materials. Another author independently validated all extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We converted all mean standard errors to standard deviations by multiplying with the square root of the sample size. We transformed coordinates that were reported in Talairach space to MNI space using the tal2icbm method ( ). We contacted article authors to retrieve any missing data. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation   meta  -analyses \n  \nWe performed a   meta  -analysis on the extracted activation foci for case-control differences using the revised activation likelihood estimation (ALE) procedure ( ,  ,  ) , implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks). In brief, ALE tests whether the convergence of reported activation foci across experiments is greater than what is expected by chance. This is done by modelling the location of each activation foci in an experiment by a 3-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution, where the reported coordinate is treated as the center of the distribution, and the size of the distribution depends on the number of participants in the experiment. The union of modeled activations across experiments provides a whole-brain voxel-wise distribution of ALE scores that is tested against a null distribution of spatially independent foci (the null hypothesis that activation foci are randomly distributed throughout the brain). Following current best-practice guidelines, we assessed the significance of convergence of activation foci using a voxel-level threshold of and a cluster-level familywise error-corrected threshold of , and performed ALE   meta  -analyses only when at least 17 experiments reported activation foci for a contrast ( ,  ). Additional details on the ALE procedure is found elsewhere ( ,  ). \n\nOur primary analysis aimed to identify brain areas with aberrant activity during inhibitory control in patients with OCD by evaluating differences between patients and controls irrespective of the sign of the difference (i.e., OCD \u2260 HC). Our use of an unsigned contrast was partly motivated by the fact that existing experiments have reported opposing activation differences between patients with OCD and HC subjects for many of the same regions, and sometimes even for different conditions within the same experiment (e.g.,  ). Specifically, it is hypothesized that individual regions in patients with OCD may show hyperactivation for low task demands but hypoactivation for high task demands ( ). This implies that opposing activations of the same region in inhibitory control tasks with varying cognitive load might not reflect irreconcilable findings, but instead a key characteristic of fronto-striatal dysfunction in OCD. Next, we sought to find areas with consistent hyperactivation or hypoactivation by separately   meta  -analyzing reported activation foci of greater brain activity in patients compared with controls (OCD\u00a0>\u00a0HC) and activation foci of less activity in patients than controls (OCD\u00a0<\u00a0HC). In the interest of isolating different processes involved in inhibitory control, we wanted to repeat our analyses restricted to two different classifications of inhibitory control: cognitive inhibition experiments (i.e., Flanker, Simon, Stroop, Multisource interference, and Switching\/Shifting) and response inhibition experiments (i.e., Stop signal and Go\/no-go). Finally, because only three articles included pediatric samples, we decided post-hoc to conduct the same   meta  -analyses restricted to experiments on adult samples (as defined by a cut-off of 18\u00a0years of age). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Article selection and sample characteristics \n  \nA total of 56 full-text articles amongst 351 non-duplicate records retrieved from database search were selected for eligibility assessment ( ). We did not identify any additional records from other sources. We included 21 articles ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) that compared activation related to inhibitory control in 394 OCD patients and 410 HC subjects in 35 experiments in the review ( ). Thirty-four articles were excluded based on our pre-defined criteria, of which 9 articles were excluded solely because they did not find significant case-control differences for the appropriate task contrast ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Furthermore, one article ( ) was excluded post-hoc because the OCD and HC groups differed substantially in their respective mean ages (33.5\u00a0years and 51.3\u00a0years) and gender distributions (25\u00a0% females and 83\u00a0% females). The included OCD samples comprised predominantly adolescents and young adults (range of mean ages\u00a0=\u00a013.5\u201339.1\u00a0years) with moderate to severe OCD symptoms assessed with the age-appropriate version of the (Child) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( ,  ) (CY-BOCS\/Y-BOCS) (range of mean score\u00a0=\u00a015.4\u201329.7, weighted mean age\u00a0=\u00a022.7\u00a0years [SD\u00a0=\u00a05.4\u00a0years]). Among the OCD patients, 22.8\u00a0% were on medication at the time of scanning (most commonly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). The remaining were medication-free at the time of scanning and at least two weeks prior. All articles ascertained OCD according to Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM;  ) criteria using a semi-structured clinical interview in combination with either CY-BOCS or Y-BOCS. All articles adequately matched OCD patients and healthy controls on gender (53.6\u00a0% females compared with 51.2\u00a0% females across articles) and age (weighted mean age of 29.3\u00a0years [SD\u00a0=\u00a07.8\u00a0years] compared with 28.5\u00a0years [SD\u00a0=\u00a07.1\u00a0years]). Additional details on included samples are presented in  .   \nPRISMA flow chart for the selection of articles included in the review. \n    \nArticles included in the meta-analysis. \n      \nSamples included in the   meta  -analysis. \n    \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nThe locations of activation foci from experiments reporting case-control differences are shown in  . We first assessed experiments that showed case-control differences irrespective of the direction of difference. Thirty-five experiments (372 unique subjects; average of 16.7 subjects per experiment) reported results for the OCD \u2260 HC contrast. We did not find evidence to suggest convergence of reported case-control differences irrespective of the direction of difference (  P   = .116). We did not have sufficient data to assess experiments that found hyperactivation in patients relative to controls (OCD\u00a0>\u00a0HC) as only 15 experiments (233 unique subjects) reported results for this contrast. Twenty experiments (314 unique subjects) reported results for the OCD\u00a0<\u00a0HC contrast. We did not find evidence to suggest convergence of reported case-control differences in experiments reporting hypoactivation in OCD relative to HC (  P   = .073).   \nDistribution of foci from cognitive inhibition experiments (top) and response inhibition experiments (bottom) reporting significant activation differences between patients with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and healthy control subjects. Activation foci were widely distributed in both types of experiments. Red foci show the locations of activation differences in experiments reporting greater inhibition-related activation in patients, whereas blue foci denote the coordinates in experiments reporting reduced inhibition-related activation in patients. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  \n\nTo evaluate different subprocesses of inhibitory control, we first restricted our analyses to cognitive inhibition experiments. Twenty-five experiments (279 unique subjects; average of 15.4 subjects per experiment) reported results for the OCD HC contrast in cognitive inhibition experiments. The   meta  -analysis revealed convergence of case-control activation differences bilaterally in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC; BA32) extending into the medial frontal gyrus (BA6 and BA9; cluster volume of 824\u00a0mm ; see  ). This location was reported in 4 of the 25 experiments (corresponding to 16\u00a0% of the experiments) and came from four different articles ( ,  ,  ,  ). The relative contribution of activation foci for hyperactivation and activation foci for hypoactivation to the OCD HC contrast were approximately 0.1\u00a0% and 99.9\u00a0%, respectively, indicating that the difference between OCD and HC was predominantly driven by hypoactivation in the OCD group. We did not have sufficient data to individually assess cognitive inhibition experiments that found hyperactivation in OCD relative to HC (10 experiments and 147 unique subjects) or hypoactivation in OCD relative to HC (15 experiments and 221 unique subjects).   \nMeta-analysis results for cognitive inhibition experiments overlaid on the MNI-152 template brain. Abnormal activation during cognitive inhibition was observed for OCD patients when compared to HC subjects in a cluster in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC\/BA32) extending into the medial frontal gyrus (BA6 and BA9). Note: HC\u00a0=\u00a0healthy control; OCD\u00a0=\u00a0obsessive compulsive disorder; L\u00a0=\u00a0left; R\u00a0=\u00a0right. \n  \n\nWe then wanted to restrict our analyses to response inhibition experiments. However, we did not have sufficient data to perform any   meta  -analysis restricted to response inhibition experiments, as only 10 response inhibition experiments reported case-control differences. \n\nFinally, we repeated our analyses restricted to experiments on adult samples, because only 3 articles included pediatric samples. Excluding experiments on pediatric samples from the analyses did not alter the overall results. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nApplying best-practice methodology for conducting and reporting ALE, our   meta  -analyses assessed the evidence for abnormalities in activation related to inhibitory control in patients with OCD compared to HC subjects. Our primary   meta  -analysis did not reveal evidence to suggest consistent differences in inhibition-related brain activation between patients with OCD and HC subjects. Notably, this null-finding occurred in a well-powered   meta  -analysis: the sample of 35 experiments is considered adequate by present guidelines for neuroimaging   meta  -analyses ( ,  ) and gave us more than 80\u00a0% power to detect a convergence of activation differences in areas that were identified in just 7 (20\u00a0%) of the experiments ( ) Existing fMRI   meta  -analyses of fewer experiments found aberrant activation of several brain regions, most consistently the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the dorsal striatum ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). We were therefore surprised to not find evidence of convergence of activation differences between OCD patients and HC subjects when considering the entire body of available data from inhibitory control tasks. Differences in the scope, the   meta  -analytical approach and the experiments included in the   meta  -analyses may have contributed to this discrepancy. For example, Carlisi et al. ( ); Norman et al. ( ) and Norman et al. ( ) used the anisotropic effect size version of seed-based   d   mapping (AES-SDM) to combine peak coordinates and non-thresholded   t  -maps ( ;  ). In contrast to ALE, AES-SDM can include   t  -maps from experiments that did not find significant case-control differences in the   meta  -analysis and is therefore able to identify consistent differences in brain activation that do not reach whole-brain significance in individual experiments. On the other hand, AES-SDM must rely on assumptions to impute the effect size of a peak coordinate if it is not reported in the article and the   t  -map is not available. ALE ignores all the information about the size of the effect and is therefore potentially less prone to be biased by systematic differences in the availability of data.  ;  ;   and   used ALE in their reviews. However,  ;   and   performed   meta  -analyses on activation differences obtained from less than the recommended minimum of 17 fMRI experiments ( ). Consequently, their   meta  -analyses were not adequately powered to detect even moderate sized effects and were furthermore at an increased risk of being driven largely by a single dominant experiment. Additionally,   and   used the false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons ( ), which has been shown to be inappropriate for neuroimaging data ( ) and to entail both low sensitivity and high susceptibility to spurious, false positive findings ( ).   performed adequately powered ALE   meta  -analyses on activation differences between OCD patients and HC subjects in executive function fMRI experiments and found that only hypoactivation of the right caudate body in OCD patients survived thresholding using the optimal cluster-level FWE correction at   P  \u00a0< .05. Nevertheless, because this review assessed a broader range of cognitive functions, it is possible that the reported hypoactivation of the right caudate in OCD patients was related to cognitive processes other than inhibitory control. \n\nDifferences in the experimental design of included experiments may have contributed to our null finding. Prior work has shown that the precise neural correlates of inhibitory control depend on the extent to which different subprocesses of inhibitory control are engaged by different task demands ( ,  ,  ,  ). Our   meta  -analyses restricted to cognitive inhibition experiments revealed abnormal activation of the dACC in a cluster at the border between the rostral dACC and the pregenual region of the ventral ACC in an area of the ACC with strong connections to the dorsal PFC and striatum ( ). This finding was driven predominantly by hypoactivation in OCD patients relative to HC subjects and aligns with similar findings in previous   meta  -analyses. The dACC and PFC, together with striatum, represent key nodes of functionally segregated parallel fronto-striatal circuits ( ), which converging lines of evidence have implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD ( ,  ,  ). The functional role of the dACC during inhibitory control remains to be fully elucidated ( ), but it is likely involved in an error-processing circuit which monitors performance and signals frontal executive control regions to adjust the selection of actions upon detection of errors ( ). Interestingly, a recent   meta  -analysis of 10 inhibitory control tasks that concurrently included both an error and an inhibition contrast found error-related hyperactivation of the dACC, but inhibition-related hypoactivation of the same region ( ). Moreover, decreased activation of the dACC has previously been associated with increases in task demands ( ). Together with previous findings, our result support the notion that any existing perturbations of dACC activation during inhibitory control in OCD are likely dependent on the precise cognitive and contextual demands. Still, not a lot of confidence should be placed in this one positive finding: it was only marginally significant (  P   = .04) and was derived from a subgroup   meta  -analysis, which was not corrected for multiple comparisons. Moreover, abnormal activation of the dACC was reported in only 4 of the 25 experiments included in the   meta  -analysis (corresponding to 16\u00a0%), and merely 4 of a total of 34 experiments (12\u00a0%) when also considering the nine experiments that were excluded solely because they had null results. \n\nHeterogeneity driven by differences in sample characteristics may also have contributed to inconsistencies across experiments. Marked differences exist between pediatric OCD and adult OCD ( ), and impairments of inhibitory control may manifest only later in the trajectory of the disorder ( ). Although we were not able to assess the effects of age or disease duration on our findings, a post-hoc sub-group analyses restricted to experiments on adults suggested that the results of our   meta  -analyses were not notably affected by data from the 3 pediatric samples. Additionally, the frequent use of medication (most commonly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in many of the included samples may have altered brain function during inhibitory control ( ,  ), but the diversity in medication status across samples made it difficult to conduct appropriate sub-analyses to investigate this. \n\nSeveral limitations of our review need mentioning. Our ALE approach relied on reported coordinates for significant activation differences rather than non-thresholded statistical maps for group differences. As such, our method may have missed patterns of brain activation abnormalities that do not reach whole-level significance in experiments, but which otherwise converge when non-thresholded maps are integrated. Additionally, we did not assess potential effects of medication status ( ) or duration of illness ( ) in the included OCD samples. Finally, OCD frequently co-occur with affective disorders ( ) and share features of affective dysregulation linked to abnormal dACC activity ( ,  ). Comorbid affective disorders were common in the OCD samples included in this review and may therefore also have affected our findings. \n\nTo conclude, this systematic review used a stringent   meta  -analytic approach to quantitatively synthesize experiments reporting abnormal brain activation during inhibitory control in patients with OCD. We did not find evidence to suggest that observed activation differences across a variety of inhibitory control tasks converged onto the same brain regions. However, a subgroup analysis suggested limited convergence of activation differences during cognitive inhibition in the dACC. Overall, our findings suggest that if abnormalities in brain activation during inhibitory control are present in OCD, the activation pattern is likely not robust or consistent across tasks. As the field matures and additional data becomes available, future   meta  -analyses will be better equipped to provide more detailed examinations of different facets of inhibitory control and task-specific effects in OCD. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Valdemar Funch Uhre:   Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

The present study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies examining the relationship between  H-MRS glutamate and\/or GABA levels and task-related fMRI signal in the healthy brain. Ovid (Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO) and Pubmed databases were systematically searched to identify articles published until December 2019. The primary outcome of interest was the association between resting levels of glutamate or GABA and task-related fMRI. Fifty-five papers were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. A further 22 studies were entered into four separate meta-analyses. These meta-analyses found evidence of significant negative associations between local GABA levels and (a) fMRI activation to visual tasks in the occipital lobe, and (b) activation to emotion processing in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)\/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, there was no significant association between mPFC\/ACC glutamate levels and fMRI activation to cognitive control tasks or to emotional processing, with the relationship to emotion processing related neural activity narrowly missing significance. Moreover, our systematic review also found converging evidence of negative associations between GABA levels and local brain activity, and positive associations between glutamate levels and distal brain activity, outside of the  H-MRS sampling region. Albeit less consistently, additional relationships between GABA levels and distal brain activity and between glutamate levels and local brain activity were found. It remains unclear if the absence of effects for other brain regions and other cognitive-emotional domains reflects study heterogeneity or potential confounding effects of age, sex, or other unknown factors. Advances in  H-MRS methodology as well as in the integration of  H-MRS readouts with other imaging modalities for indexing neural activity hold great potential to reveal key aspects of the pathophysiology of mental health disorders involving aberrant interactions between neurochemistry and neurophysiology such as schizophrenia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExcitation-inhibition balance plays a major role in determining neural activity ( ). At a microscopic level, the influence of the brain's major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters [glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)], on neural activity has been studied in detail [see Isaacson and Scanziani ( ), Lauritzen et al. ( )]. At a macroscopic level, this investigation has been achieved through the development and optimisation of neuroimaging techniques enabling quantification of GABA and glutamate concentrations via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS), and of neural activation via measurement of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BOLD signal has been linked to local field potentials of dendritic origins, implying the signal is likely to reflect incoming input ( ), thereby being closely linked to, and affected by, neurotransmission. However, the relationship between neurotransmitter levels and task-related neural activity remains unclear. \n\nA previous narrative review by Duncan et al. ( ) sought to address this question with a comprehensive overview of studies using imaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography, fMRI, positron emission tomography and  H-MRS, as well as behavioural measures as proxies for neural activity and pharmaceutical manipulations of neurotransmitter levels. The authors reported that GABA levels were related to reduced positive BOLD response or reduced negative BOLD response (NBR) within the same brain region, while glutamate levels were more commonly related to inter-regional neural responses. The number of publications using multimodal fMRI and  H-MRS techniques has more than doubled since this review was published, and studies using this type of multimodal combination are expected to keep increasing in the future due to the ease of collecting both types of data within a single scanning session. More recent reports outside of the previous review include studies on regions of interest that had previously been examined too infrequently to permit meta-analysis, providing important insights into the nature of neurochemistry-neurophysiology associations in a variety of brain regions and task domains. \n\nThe present study aims to address these issues by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of  H-MRS and task-based fMRI studies in the healthy brain. We then meta-analyse homogeneous studies based on the location of  H-MRS voxel placement and fMRI paradigm. Finally, we discuss the findings in light of abnormalities in these relationships in psychiatric populations, such as schizophrenia patients, and their potential implications on brain processes in psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nSystematic searches were performed on Pubmed and Ovid (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) databases from database inception to 4 December 2019. Search strategies for the individual databases included the terms \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d AND \u201cmagnetic resonance spectroscopy\u201d AND (\u201cGABA\u201d OR \u201cglutamate\u201d) (for full search syntax see  ). We included studies that used  H-MRS to measure GABA, glutamate or Glx (combined glutamate and glutamine) metabolite levels to test associations with task-related fMRI activation. Eligible study designs included observational studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, or experimental studies (for full eligibility criteria see  ). The population of interest were healthy human participants, or healthy human control groups from case-control studies. Interventional studies were excluded, unless those studies conducted and reported the outcome of interest analysis with baseline measures. Studies assessing only changes in metabolite levels before, during and after a task together with BOLD activation were not included as they do not investigate the relationship between resting-state neurotransmitter levels and neural activity modulated by stimuli. Two reviewers (AK and CB) independently screened search result titles and abstracts of papers for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All potentially eligible studies were screened full-text for inclusion. Reference lists of eligible studies were hand-searched for further relevant articles. \n\nTwo independent reviewers (AK and PBL) extracted data using a standardised template datasheet. The primary outcomes extracted were the metabolite type,  H-MRS metabolite sampling region, fMRI task paradigm, neural activation region, and relationship between metabolite and neural activity. Studies investigating the relationship between  H-MRS GABA or glutamate and task-related BOLD signal performed analyses in one or both of two different ways: by including metabolite levels as a covariate in a regression, or by extracting the percentage of BOLD signal change (%SC) from a region of interest (ROI) and using correlation analysis with the metabolite levels. Both types of analysis methods were included in this review. Regressions either covered the whole-brain or a predetermined ROI such as the  H-MRS voxel, an anatomical ROI or a mask derived from an activation cluster. Correlation analyses used %SC extracted from sources such as the peak voxel within or mean activation across an activated cluster, an anatomically defined ROI, or the  H-MRS voxel. Additional extracted data for the systematic review included the statistical significance of the relationship, covariates tested in the analysis, sample size, age and sex characteristics of the sample, scanner strength,  H-MRS sequence, and reference metabolite. In cases where no statistical significance value was reported for the relationship itself and only Pearson's   r   correlation coefficients were reported [e.g., ( )],   p-  values were calculated through conversion of r values to test statistic   t   with the formula \n\nThe   p  -value was then derived using the sampling distribution of Student's   t  . This calculation of the   p  -value was used to ascertain the significance of the correlation coefficient. \n\nSome studies verified their main findings ( H-MRS x fMRI response) in the following ways: (1) substituting the metabolite levels from their primary region of interest with those from a different, control sampling region; (2) substituting the fMRI response from their primary task paradigm with that from a control task; (3) substituting the fMRI response from their primary region of interest with that from a control region during the same task. Such control analyses may be found in  . A formal quality assessment was not conducted due to a lack of standard quality assessment for such types of studies. Imaging and study design parameters were, however, collected ( \u2013 ,  ). Review findings [see   for PRISMA flowchart ( )] are presented according to the brain region from which metabolite levels were sampled. \n  \nPRISMA Flowchart. \n  \n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nStudies were further subdivided by  H-MRS voxel location, task domain and fMRI activation foci. For quantitative analysis,   r   correlation coefficients,   t  -values,   z  -values and sample sizes were compiled. Although the recommended minimum number of studies for meta-analysis is two, this does not apply to random-effect models ( ), which the MetaNSUE method employs ( ). Additionally, given the likelihood of a non-statistically significant unreported effect, the minimum number of comparable studies was set at a more conservative number of \u22654. Meta-analysis was conducted using the MetaNSUE package for R ( ), where r correlation coefficients were converted into effect sizes for a meta-analytic pooled effect size. This tool was used due to its ability to impute results for unreported correlation coefficients, which can often be the case when correlations are non-significant. Authors were contacted for unreported   r   correlation coefficients. However, in the case of unreported   r   correlation coefficients, the number of imputations was kept at the package's default of 500 imputations per study. \n\nIn instances where studies reported both   t  - and   z  -values of significantly correlated clusters from a regression analysis,   t  - and   z  -values were converted into   r   correlation coefficients as follows: \n  \n Z  -score to   p  -value calculation:  \n  \n P  -value to student   t  -value: using Microsoft Excel's TINV function \n  \n T  -value to   r   correlation coefficient conversion:  \n  \nSignificance was determined using two-tailed 95% confidence intervals. Further sensitivity analyses are detailed in the  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Systematic Review of Associations With GABA and Glutamate Concentrations \n  \n#### Occipital Cortex \n  \nH-MRS studies sampling GABA levels from the occipital lobe have been largely homogeneous ( ): using visual fMRI tasks and focusing only on co-localised neural activity. The first few studies in this domain found negative associations between occipital lobe GABA levels and local BOLD response to visual stimuli ( \u2013 ,  ). Muthukumaraswamy et al. ( ) not only found a negative association to BOLD response amplitude, but also a positive correlation with BOLD response width. However, this relationship to response amplitude was not replicated in subsequent studies ( ,  ,  ,  ). Harris et al. ( ) investigated this relationship empirically, and combined their result with prior studies in a meta-analysis, where they found no evidence for a significant association between the two measures. More recently, Duncan et al. ( ) attempted to address this issue using improved methodology. A MEGA-PRESS sequence that was adapted to suppress macromolecule signal was used so that both GABA+ and GABA\u2013 were measured from the occipital lobe. Although their empirical study found no significant relationship, Duncan et al. ( ) added their results to the five studies meta-analysed in Harris et al. ( )\u2014using the same Hunter-Schmidt method employed by the   metafor   R package\u2014and found evidence in favour of a negative relationship between GABA and BOLD, regardless of macromolecule suppression. \n  \nOccipital lobe  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, Water; Cr, Creatine; (+) positive association; (#) no association; (\u2013) negative association; GABA+, GABA+macromolecules; Glx, Glutamate + Glutamine  . \n  \nNeural activity in the occipital lobe was also studied in different contexts beyond simple visual perception. Wijtenburg ( ) found a positive correlation between GABA and neural activation difference before and after a high frequency visual stimulus, an effect thought to reflect visual plasticity. In agreement with other studies, when only baseline visual stimulation-related activation was used, a negative correlation was found with GABA levels. However, results for this analysis were not published and only mentioned in the discussion. Schallmo et al. ( ) used a spatial suppression paradigm where participants had to indicate the direction of moving gratings with varying contrasts. No correlations between GABA levels in the early visual cortex and the more laterally located visual motion complex and neural response in the same regions were found. \n\nGlutamate levels repeatedly did not show a relationship to co-localised neural activity in studies of the occipital lobe ( ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ). Some of these studies utilised the same sequence to measure GABA and glutamate levels simultaneously ( ,  \u2013 ,  ). Two studies reporting a relationship with GABA levels found no association between neural activity and co-localised Glx ( ,  ). Wijtenburg et al. ( ) found a relationship between glutamate levels and an activation contrast comparing neural response before and after a high frequency visual stimulus. This relationship was also a positive one, similar to what had been observed with GABA levels. However, in this case, the association between glutamate levels and activity related to baseline visual stimuli was not reported. Finally, within the visual motion complex glutamate levels were positively correlated with neural response during motion perception in a spatial suppression paradigm ( ). \n\n\n#### Sensorimotor Cortex \n  \nStudies sampling metabolite levels in the sensorimotor cortex and adjacent areas ( ) mostly utilised a simple paradigm, in this case some form of finger-tapping task. In multiple studies, no significant associations were found between sensorimotor cortex GABA levels and local neural activity ( ,  \u2013 ). Using the same finger-tapping task, Draper et al. ( ) also found no correlation between GABA levels in a supplementary motor area and BOLD %SC. Only one study ( ), using a visually cued reaction time task, indicated a negative relationship between BOLD and GABA concentrations in the sensorimotor cortex. This same study was the only one to look at neural activity with glutamate levels in the sensorimotor cortex area and found no correlated activation clusters in a whole-brain regression. \n  \nSensorimotor cortex  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, Water; Cr, Creatine; NAA, N-acetylaspartate; (+) positive association; (#) no association; (\u2013) negative association; GABA+, GABA + macromolecule; Glx, glutamate + glutamine  . \n  \n\n#### Anterior Cingulate Cortex\/Medial Prefrontal Cortex \n  \n##### GABA Concentrations in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex\/Medial Prefrontal Cortex \n  \nDue to the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in different processes such as emotion, attention and cognition ( ), various task contexts have been used ( ). Many studies investigated NBR within this region, due to the close coupling between the ACC\/mPFC and the default mode network (DMN). Four studies investigating GABA levels in the mPFC\/ACC region found a positive relationship with regional NBR, i.e., a negative relationship with neural activity ( ,  ,  ,  ). Northoff et al. ( ) found that during conditions that produced little NBR compared to rest, this negative relationship between GABA levels and neural activity was not apparent. In agreement with these findings, using facial expressions Stan et al. ( ) observed that mPFC GABA+ concentration was negatively correlated with subgenual ACC (sgACC) fMRI response to sadness. However, neural activity during other emotion categories\u2014happy, fear, or anger\u2014was not correlated with GABA+ concentrations. When using an emotion processing task, Levar et al. ( ) only found a negative correlation with GABA+ levels when contrasting neural activity during negative emotional stimuli with response to positive emotional stimuli. Other studies failed to find negative correlations between regional GABA concentrations and neural activity, or positive relationships with NBR, during cognitive control tasks ( ,  ), a verbal working memory task ( ), a reward-guided decision-making task ( ), and a fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction retrieval task ( ). \n  \nMedial prefrontal cortex\/anterior cingulate cortex  H-MRS GABA studies. \n  \n Wt, Water; Cr, Creatine; NAA, N-acetylaspartic acid; NBR, negative BOLD response; (+) positive association; (#) no association; (\u2013) negative association; GABA+, GABA + macromolecule; Glx, glutamate+glutamine; GSH, glutathione; PCu, Precuneus; dACC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; MCC, middle cingulate cortex; WM, white mater volume fraction within  H-MRS voxel; GM, grey mater volume fraction within  H-MRS voxel; \/, OR. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column [i.e., Region: task related activity (+\/#\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx]  . \n  \nCorrelations between GABA levels and distal neural activity were also found in some of these studies ( \u2013 ). Neural activity related to fear recovery in the amygdala was positively correlated with dACC GABA levels, while neural activity related to late phases of fear extinction in the right amygdala, cerebellum, middle cingulate gyrus, and right insula were negatively correlated with GABA ( ). Levar et al. ( ), using non-facial picture stimuli, found that dACC GABA concentrations correlated positively with activity in the left amygdala during positive emotion, negative emotion, all emotion and positive over negative emotion. Right amygdala activity related to positive emotion was also positively correlated with dACC GABA levels. Activity of the right superior frontal gyrus during negative pictures was negatively correlated with GABA levels. BOLD signal related to all picture conditions was positively correlated with GABA levels in the left and right hippocampi. ACC GABA concentrations were negatively associated with cognitive control-related BOLD signal in two clusters. The first was localised mainly to the left parietal cortex, spanning the postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and the middle occipital lobe. The second cluster was found mainly in the left dlPFC, including regions within the middle frontal lobe, inferior frontal lobe, precentral gyrus, superior temporal lobe, rolandic operculum, and postcentral gyrus. \n\n\n##### Glutamate Concentrations in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex\/Medial Prefrontal Cortex \n  \nTwenty-one studies sampled glutamate levels within the mPFC\/ACC regions and investigated its relationship to neural activity within the same region as well as in other brain regions. Of those, 15 studies did not find an association between mPFC\/ACC glutamate levels and local activation. These studies used a variety of tasks encompassing: emotion ( ,  ), cognitive control ( ,  \u2013 ), working memory ( ,  ), reward ( ,  ), intero- and exteroceptive awareness ( ), aversion ( ), and a verbal fluency task ( ). Nonetheless, other studies did find relation between glutamate concentration and regional neural activity. Stan et al. ( ) found mPFC glutamate levels were correlated with pregenual ACC (pgACC) response to anger, but not with regional activity during viewing of other emotional categories. Using an empathy task, Duncan et al. ( ) sought to investigate the relationship between pgACC glutamate levels and neural activity in the task-activated supragenual ACC, as well as between supragenual ACC glutamate with pgACC activity. A whole-brain regression with pgACC Glx levels showed a relationship to empathy-related BOLD in the supragenual ACC (a cluster overlapping with the supragenual ACC  H-MRS voxel). supragenual ACC Glx levels, however, were not associated with pgACC activation during the empathy task. ACC glutamate levels were also studied in conjunction to neural activity during a salience processing task using emotional and erotic pictures ( ). Activation in the sgACC related to unexpectedness of emotional pictures displayed a negative correlation with glutamate. Dissecting this association, the authors found that a positive relationship between glutamate and expected emotional picture viewing drove this finding. In a separate study, Cadena et al. ( ) scanned a control group twice with a 6-week interval ( ). ACC Glx levels were positively correlated with ACC activation during cognitive control at the baseline scan, a relationship that was not observed at the second scanning session 6 weeks later. Enzi et al. ( ) sampled Glx concentrations from the pgACC, where they found a partial positive correlation to NBR during anticipation of reward and of no outcome. Through further investigation, the authors found that Glx concentrations were correlated to the rest condition and hypothesised that this relationship was largely driving the relationship between glutamate levels and deactivation during reward anticipation. \n\nIn terms of associations between glutamate levels and neural activity outside of the  H-MRS region, three studies reported positive correlations with neural activity outside of the ACC\/mPFC. Duncan et al. ( ) found mPFC glutamate levels were correlated positively with sensorimotor cortex and left insula activation during the anticipation of aversion. In a different study, Duncan et al. ( ) showed, through whole-brain regression with Glx levels in the pgACC, a significant correlation with empathy-related activation in the left precuneus, bilateral amygdala and putamen, right superior frontal gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus. Cadena et al. ( ) observed a correlation with cognitive control-related activation within the insula, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule and precuneus. Notably, the findings in the bilateral insula and left inferior parietal lobule were replicated in the sample 6 weeks later. Interestingly, one study observed different correlations depending on task load. Falkenberg et al. ( ) found three activation clusters where there was a significant interaction between glutamate levels and the parameters of a cognitive control task: five auditory intensity difference conditions and the instruction of which ear to pay attention to.   Post-hoc   tests showed that in individuals with lower levels of glutamate, neural response was higher during high cognitive control conditions, i.e., when attention was directed towards the less salient stimulus, whereas in individuals with high levels of glutamate, neural activity was higher during low cognitive control conditions. Four studies found negative correlations between glutamate or Glx levels and neural activity outside of the ACC\/mPFC. Overbeek et al. ( ) observed ACC glutamate levels were positively associated with NBR in a cluster spanning from the PCC and precuneus to the occipital cortex and cerebellum. Von During et al. ( ) also found that ACC glutamate levels were positively associated with NBR in the PCC, with higher glutamate predicting higher deactivation of this area in response to a variety of stimuli. Neural activity in a variety of other regions were also negatively correlated with ACC glutamate levels in this study (see  ). One study investigated ACC glutamate levels with cognitive control-related activation within the striatum only, to which a negative relationship was found in a composite group of ADHD patients, unaffected siblings and healthy controls ( ). Similarly, Gleich et al. ( ) found a negative relationship with ventral striatum activation in adolescents but not in adults. \n  \nMedial prefrontal cortex\/anterior cingulate cortex  H-MRS glutamate studies. \n  \n Wt, Water; Cr, Creatine; NAA, N-acetylaspartic acid; NBR, negative BOLD response; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; MCC, middle cingulate cortex; vStr, ventral striatum; PCu, precuneus; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; sgACC, subgenual ACC; Glx, glutamate+glutamine; WM, white mater volume fraction within  H-MRS voxel; GM, grey mater volume fraction within  H-MRS voxel;  , uncorrected finding; (+) positive association; (#) no association; (\u2013) negative association; \/= OR. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column [i.e., Region: task related activity (+\/#\/\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx]  . \n  \n\n\n#### Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex \n  \nAll studies sampling GABA or glutamate levels from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) used a working memory fMRI task ( ). Only one study, comparing children and adolescents with sport-related injuries not involving the head and with no history of concussion, to a group of concussed individuals, found a significant positive correlation between dlPFC GABA levels and local activation ( ). Two studies did not find a relationship ( ,  ). Similarly, three studies that investigated glutamate levels also found no relationships to regional neural activity ( ,  ,  ). \n  \nDorsolateral prefrontal cortex  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, water; Cr, creatine; tCr, creatine+phosphocreatine; Glx, glutamate+glutamine  . \n  \n\n#### Temporal Lobe \n  \nWithin studies of the temporal lobe ( ), the auditory cortex, anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus were sampled for metabolites and fMRI tasks were largely based on the respective functions of the  H-MRS sampling regions. Two studies found a negative relationship between GABA levels and local activation during thought retrieval and though suppression ( ) and during semantic processing ( ). However, Harris et al. ( ) found no relationship between fMRI activity in the auditory cortex and local GABA levels. \n  \nTemporal lobe  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, water; Cr, creatine; GABA+, GABA+macromolecules; NAA, N-acetylaspartic acid; GM, grey matter volume fraction within  H-MRS voxel; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; vStr, ventral striatum; \/, OR. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column (i.e. Region: task related activity (+\/#\/\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx)  . \n  \nUnlike GABA, hippocampal glutamate levels were not found to be correlated with local activity in several studies ( ,  ,  ). Glutamate levels were, however, positively correlated to neural activity outside of the hippocampus: parahippocampus ( ), inferior frontal gyrus ( ) and ventral striatum ( ). \n\n\n#### Insula \n  \nThree studies ( ,  ,  ) measured relationships between metabolites and neural activity in this region ( ). Lipp et al. ( ) reported a negative association between GABA concentration and insula neural activity only to animal picture stimuli, while pictures of other categories did not elicit such association. Interestingly, another study ( ) identified a positive correlation between GABA levels and neural response to interoceptive awareness. Insula GABA levels were additionally correlated to distal neural activity: positively to activation in the amgydala and ventral striatum ( ), and negatively to activation in the medial cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area ( ). Meanwhile, glutamate levels did not correlate with neural activity in the insular cortex ( ,  ). \n  \nInsula  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, water; NAA, N-acetylaspartic acid; tCr, creatine+phosphocreatine; GM, grey matter volume within  H-MRS voxel; vStr, ventral Striatum; MCC, middle cingulate cortex; SMA, supplementary motor area; \/, OR. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column (i.e. Region: task related activity (+\/#\/\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx)  . \n  \n\n#### Posterior Cingulate Cortex\/Precuneus \n  \nTwo studies investigated both GABA and glutamate levels within the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)\/precuneus (PCu) region ( ,  ) ( ) that typically deactivate during some cognitive tasks but activate putatively during processing of scenes to support autobiographical memory and imagined events ( ). Deactivation of the PCC\/PCu region as well as the entire DMN (including the mPFC, PCC\/PCu, and bilateral parahippocampus) during a working memory task were investigated separately in relation to glutamate and GABA concentrations ( ). Regression models showed that as glutamate increased NBR decreased (i.e., weaker deactivation). Conversely, GABA levels were positively correlated with NBR for all but the lowest cognitive load (1-back condition), i.e., as GABA levels increased, deactivation increased, in both the model with PCC\/PCu deactivation and DMN deactivation as dependent variable. In contrast, when using a perceptual discrimination task, Costigan et al. ( ) found no association between PCC\/PCu activation and local Glx and GABA+ levels. \n  \nPosterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, water; GM, grey matter volume within  H-MRS voxel; Glx, glutamate+glutamine; NBR, negative BOLD response; DMN, default mode network; \/, OR. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column (i.e. Region: task related activity (+\/#\/\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx)  . \n  \n\n#### Other Regions \n  \nA few studies have sampled GABA and glutamate levels from less frequently inspected regions combined with neural activity ( ). Harris et al. ( ) found no relationship between activation related to eye saccades and GABA levels in the frontal eye field. Two studies sampled glutamate from the thalamus, both using a verbal fluency task. Fusar-Poli et al. ( ) found no significant effects, while Allen et al. ( ) found significant correlations with activation in the right superior frontal gyrus\/sulcus and the right cingulate sulcus. Two studies found a positive correlation between Glx levels and local activity in two different brain regions: the substantia nigra ( ) and the dorsal striatum ( ). \n  \nRemaining  H-MRS studies. \n  \n Wt, water; \/, OR; GABA+, GABA+macromolecules; Glx, glutamate+glutamaine; vStr, ventral striatum; NAc, nucleus accumbens. Neural activity is co-localised with the  H-MRS sampling region unless otherwise specified in the relationship column (i.e. Region: task related activity (+\/#\/\u2013) GABA\/Glu\/Glx)  . \n  \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Associations With GABA Concentrations \n  \nWithin the studies sampling GABA, two groups of more than four studies emerged: occipital lobe GABA levels in combination with a visual task, and ACC GABA levels in combination with emotion processing tasks. For illustration of the voxel positions of each study per meta-analysis see  ,  . \n  \nMeta-analysis of studies investigating occipital lobe GABA levels and visual perception-related neural activity in the occipital lobe.   (A)   Position of occipital voxels per study.   (B)   Forest plot of meta-analysis results.   p   < 0.10;   p   < 0.05;   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.001. \n    \nMeta-analysis of studies investigating GABA levels and emotion related neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.   (A)   Position of ACC voxels per study.   (B)   Forest plot of meta-analysis results.   p   < 0.10;   p   < 0.05;   p   < 0.01. \n  \nFor the relationship between GABA levels and BOLD within the occipital lobe, the systematic search for articles identified nine eligible studies for quantitative analysis ( \u2013 ,  ). The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between GABA and BOLD in the occipital lobe (  r   = \u22120.45 [\u22120.63, \u22120.22],   p   = 0.002,   I   = 47.06%) ( ). \n\nAnother four studies investigated ACC GABA in relation to local response to emotion tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ). Correlation coefficients were available for three of these, while Levar et al. ( ) used a regression with ACC GABA levels as a covariate. The latter found a negatively correlated cluster in the dorsal ACC for negative vs. positive emotion, however, this result was not used for the main meta-analysis for which comparable contrasts were selected only (specific or all emotion vs. baseline). The main meta-analysis of this relationship yielded a significant negative relationship between ACC GABA and regional emotion-related neural activity (  r   = 0.53 [\u22120.79, \u22120.11],   p   = 0.02,   I   = 34.04%) ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Associations With Glutamate Concentrations \n  \nTwo meta-analyses were performed. One combined glutamate levels in the ACC and local activation during cognitive control tasks. The other combined glutamate levels in the ACC and local activation during emotional tasks. For illustration of the voxel positions of each study per meta-analysis see  ,  . \n  \nMeta-analysis of studies investigating ACC glutamate levels and regional cognitive control-related neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.   (A)   Position of ACC voxels per study.   (B)   Forest plot of meta-analysis results.   p   < 0.10;   p   < 0.001. \n    \nMeta-analysis of studies investigating ACC glutamate levels and regional emotion related neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.   (A)   Position of ACC voxels per study.   (B)   Forest plot of meta-analysis results.   p   < 0.10;   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.001. \n  \nSix studies ( ,  \u2013 ,  ) were included in the meta-analysis of the relationship between ACC glutamate levels and local activation during cognitive control. These were a mixture of studies using correlation and regression analysis. When regression analysis had been performed on the whole-brain level and no significant correlation with the ACC was found, this was entered into the meta-analysis as a non-significant result to avoid bias. The meta-analysis did not find support for a relationship between ACC glutamate levels and neural activity during cognitive control [  r   = 0.19 (\u22120.24, 0.56),   p   = 0.39,   I   = 71.62] ( ). \n\nFor the meta-analysis investigating the relationship between ACC glutamate levels and local activation during emotion processing, seven studies were included ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). As with the previous meta-analysis on cognitive control, studies utilised a mixture of correlation and regression analyses. This analysis marginally missed significance for a positive relationship between ACC glutamate levels and regional emotion related neural activity [  r   = 0.41 (\u22120.04, 0.72),   p   = 0.07,   I   = 79.69%] ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main finding of this meta-analysis was that GABA levels were negatively correlated with co-localised neural activity within the ACC during emotion processing and within the occipital lobe during visual stimulation. Further meta-analyses showed that glutamate levels within the ACC were not correlated with co-localised neural activity during either cognitive control or emotion processing, however, the latter meta-analysis narrowly missed significance. These findings were further supported by a systematic review of all fMRI- H-MRS association studies to date, where increasing resting GABA levels were repeatedly associated with either weaker neural activation or stronger neural deactivation. On the other hand, glutamate levels were largely not correlated with intra-regional neural activity, although a handful of studies did find a positive correlation. An additional finding was that glutamate concentrations were largely positively correlated with regions outside of the  H-MRS sampling area; however, negative inter-regional associations were also identified in multiple studies. GABA concentrations were less likely to be associated with regions outside of the  H-MRS sampling area with only a few studies providing evidence of a positive or negative relationship with inter-regional neural activation depending on the metabolite sampling region and the neural activation region. \n\nThese findings support and extend prior reported trends. Previously, in a narrative review Duncan et al. ( ) highlighted that GABA tended to be negatively correlated with regional neural activity in the visual, auditory, sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortices, while glutamate was positively correlated with neural activity in regions outside of the sampling region of the metabolite. In the present study, by using a systematic rather than narrative review method and capitalising on the large increase in available studies specifically using  H-MRS and fMRI, a more region-dependent relationship between these specific measures emerged. The negative relationship between GABA levels and regional neural activation was confirmed within the occipital cortex, ACC\/mPFC, temporal lobe, and PCC. However, regions such as the sensorimotor cortex, auditory cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex either did not exhibit this relationship clearly or in a few studies the relationship was in the opposite direction ( ,  ). A negative relationship between GABA levels and regional neural activation appears intuitive: increased inhibition as measured through resting state  H-MRS would be associated with decreased net activation of a region through regulation of resting excitatory activity ( ,  ). Prior work in animals found that pharmacological manipulation increasing endogenous GABA concentrations produced lower positive BOLD signal changes ( ). In the context of NBR, previous work in rats found hyperpolarisation of neurons through neuronal inhibition to correspond to a decrease in blood oxygenation ( ). Findings of a positive relationship between GABA levels and neural activity may be a result of more complex neural processes that require suppression of neural response to irrelevant stimuli to promote concurrent activation to target stimuli ( ). A relationship between GABA levels and neural activity in distal regions had not previously been identified in the literature ( ). While initial studies suggested that the relationship between GABA levels and neural activity was limited to the same region ( ,  ), a handful of recent studies reported both negative and positive relationships with activation outside of the  H-MRS voxel ( \u2013 ,  \u2013 ). Negative relationships with inter-regional neural activity may be the result of local inhibition of excitatory projections that regulate activity in other regions ( \u2013 ). \n\nIn terms of glutamate, a few studies observed a positive relationship between glutamate and local neural activity in the ACC and PCC ( ,  ,  ,  ). Additionally, both positive and negative relationships with distal neural activity were found. These findings add to the simplified positive relationship with inter-regional neural activity reported in Duncan et al. ( ). A negative relationship between BOLD activity in DMN regions, such as the PCC\/PCu, were speculated to be due to higher ACC glutamate levels supporting facilitation of salience processing, thus resulting in stronger deactivation of DMN regions ( ,  ). However, this relationship seems to be region-dependant as glutamate levels measured within the DMN, specifically the PCC, were positively related with DMN neural activation, where higher glutamate levels predicted lower local deactivation ( ). The positive relationship between glutamate levels and intra-regional neural activity may stem from an excitatory drive stimulating neural activation within the same region through recurring feedback ( ,  ). However, the relationship between glutamate levels and intra-regional neural activity may be difficult to replicate: one study failed to replicate a positive correlation between ACC glutamate and ACC neural activity at a 6-week follow-up scan within the same cohort ( ). In fact, Enzi et al. ( ) suggested resting glutamate levels may be more closely related to resting-state activation, thus being less intimately linked with task-related activity. As previously observed by Duncan et al. ( ), glutamate levels were positively associated with neural activity outside of the sampling regions for glutamate. The long-range projections of glutamatergic neurons ( ) are thought to influence neural activity in distal regions, thus giving rise to this relationship. However, a number of studies have shown that these projections may not simply reflect positive relationships with neural activity, but may also indicate that glutamate levels can negatively predict neural activity inter-regionally. \n\nThe ACC has been commonly investigated across studies, for which effects have been inconsistent. The discrepancies in  H-MRS x fMRI relationships may arise from functional segregation within the ACC ( ), its involvement in different behaviours ( ), and that it hosts both task-positive and task-negative subdivisions (e.g., pgACC and supragenual ACC). The ability of  H-MRS to discriminate between ACC subregions is still limited due to the  H-MRS voxel size, especially in the case of GABA. This may be improved by the use of high-field MRI scanners that will allow for smaller voxel sizes ( ). An additional consideration is that relationships between metabolite levels and neural activity may also be task-specific. Studies that used an active control task, rather than a low-level baseline condition such as a fixation cross [e.g., ( ,  ,  )], indicate that baseline metabolite levels are not simply correlated with any type of neural response. When neural response was confirmed for both the task of interest and the control task, different relationships between GABA levels and neural response were found indicating that metabolite levels may not be simply associated with all types of neural activity within a region ( ). \n\nDespite some incongruent findings, a pattern of neurochemical-neurofunctional relationships has emerged, which give valuable insight into psychiatric disorders where this relationship is aberrant. Measurement of metabolite levels at rest with  H-MRS is thought to reflect individual differences in number of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, number of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, and glutamate and GABA turnover ( ). It is conceivable, then, that abnormalities in metabolite levels would be reflected in differential neurochemical-neurofunctional relationships. In psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, case-control studies have suggested an aberrant relationship between ACC glutamate and local neural activity ( ) and in regions receiving inputs from the ACC, such as the insula and DMN ( ,  ,  ). Differences were found in the relationship between hippocampal Glx and inferior frontal gyrus activation, with medicated schizophrenia patients showing a less robust relationship ( ) potentially reflecting differential coupling between the two regions ( ). Activation related to prediction error within the substantia nigra was not correlated with regional glutamate levels in schizophrenia patients, which was interpreted as a glutamatergic dysfunction leading to abnormal prediction error coding ( ). Furthermore, a relationship between glutamate and working memory activation, both within the dlPFC, was found in unmedicated schizophrenia patients where no such relationship existed in healthy controls\u2014potentially due to compensatory action to glutamatergic insensitivity ( ). Given the known and increasingly well-characterised abnormalities in glutamatergic and GABAergic function associated with this psychiatric disorder ( ,  ) and the close relationship between metabolites and neurofunction, abnormalities in brain function should arise. The neurochemical-neurofunctional relationship has been investigated less frequently in other psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder. While this line of investigation showed no differences in the relationship in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder ( ,  ), patients with major depressive disorder showed stronger coupling between glutamate levels and NBR compared with healthy controls ( ). Walter et al. ( ) concluded that reduced resting state activity was driven by glutamatergic metabolism in patients with major depressive disorder. Differences in  H-MRS x fMRI relationships may be the result of variations in neurochemistry, differential abnormal functions regionally and inter-regionally, as well as structural abnormalities. Despite the correlational nature of all the studies identified here, understanding healthy relationships between metabolite and neural activity allows some insight into compensatory action within mental illness and can provide potential pharmaceutical targets for intervention. Targeting GABAergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission may be a promising avenue to treating symptoms of schizophrenia ( ) and major depressive disorder ( ). \n\n### Considerations on the Choice of Analytical Approaches \n  \nThe studies included in this review used two main types of methods to derive relationships. Harris et al. ( ) demonstrated that when using the correlational technique with %SC, the source of sampling for %SC could have a large effect on the observed relationship. Harris et al. ( ) tested five different BOLD activation sources: peak within the  H-MRS voxel, mean across the  H-MRS voxel, mean across significant activation, peak within anatomical ROI and mean across anatomical ROI. From the peak within  H-MRS voxel to the mean across significant activation, there was a maximum change in effect size of   r   = 0.47, although it should be noted that these individual correlation coefficients were not statistically significant due to Bonferroni correction. Despite these potential sources of variation, the vast majority of articles cited in our systematic review that used the correlational technique with %SC only tested the relationship between metabolites and neural activation with one source of %SC, which may cause inconsistencies in findings. \n\n\n### Effects of Potential Confounders \n  \nPreviously published studies controlled for potential confounds in diverse ways. Commonly used covariates were age, voxel tissue composition and sex. Age may have region-specific effects on levels of glutamate ( ) and of GABA ( ) and thus should be consistently controlled for. Our systematic review was not restricted to a certain age limit and instead attempted to collect data on all age ranges and noted whether studies controlled for age. Similarly, a potentially confounding effect of sex on metabolite levels was not consistently considered in individual studies, although sex has previously been identified to alter levels of glutamate ( ) and GABA ( ). \n\nA further issue refers to the use of other regions as specificity control ( ). In order to confirm that a significant association is not a global effect, metabolite analyses should be conducted both for the main region of interest as well as for a control region. Similarly, to ensure relationships can be specific to the experimental task, researchers should also evaluate the relationship between metabolite levels and a control, unrelated task. However, time constraints and participant fatigue during scanning may not enable such control measures in all studies. \n\n\n### Future Directions \n  \nAlthough it is tempting to suggest that future studies using the correlational approach should test various sources of %SC [e.g., ( )], the multiple testing corrections needed would require strong relationship effects between metabolite and BOLD signal. However, the present systematic review and meta-analyses seem to suggest such effect sizes are moderate at best for the metabolite glutamate. An alternative suggestion would be to consistently utilise %SC derived from the peak voxel within the  H-MRS voxel as many studies have done, with deviations from a standard source of %SC needing to be specifically addressed and justified. \n\nOther future suggestions for studies of this kind are to include age and sex as confounding covariates more consistently. Similarly, task and region specificity controls should be included wherever possible. One reason for the lack of substantial conclusions to be made from the above listed studies is the heterogeneity of  H-MRS locations, BOLD %SC sampling locations and region coverage within regression studies. Replication studies would allow more insight into studies that used emotional, working memory, reward and motor tasks. Additionally, combination with additional modalities such as arterial spin labelling as a different measure of brain function may help parse out the less consistent relationships seen here. Future studies should also aim to investigate the  H-MRS x fMRI relationship in further psychiatric disorders that feature glutamatergic or GABAergic abnormalities, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Abnormalities in excitation-inhibition balance are well-known and characterised in individuals in ASD ( ,  ), where reduced neural activity in corticostriatal circuits have been proposed ( ,  ) to be linked to the reduction of striatal glutamate ( ). However, further investigation of these hypotheses and the nature of the neurochemical-neurofunctional relationship in ASD is required. Finally, capitalising on the findings presented here, future studies in psychiatric populations such as schizophrenia patients may modulate metabolite levels such as glutamate to test whether neurofunction can be modulated as a result. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe significant expansion of studies combining multi-modal  H-MRS and fMRI in recent years has enabled more detailed examination of the interactions between neurochemistry and neurophysiology in the healthy brain. These studies have shown robust negative correlations between GABA levels and local activation in regions such as the occipital cortex and ACC, and positive correlations between glutamate levels and activation in distal regions. These findings have implications for our understanding of pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, a field in which studies combining  H-MRS and fMRI are burgeoning in recent years. In this context, findings from multimodal studies may provide key insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia not only by informing how the interplay between neurochemistry and neurophysiology may be altered prior and across disease stages, but also by their translational potential to elucidate whether pharmacological modulation of glutamate and\/or GABA may be a new target for addressing abnormal neurophysiology in this psychiatric disorder. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nGM, AK, and MJK: concept and design.

Tics are rapid, recurrent actions or vocalisations that may range in complexity from simple brief acts such as eye blinks or coughs, to elaborate action sequences. Tics are highly variable in their presentation among individuals, with substantial differences in the frequency, complexity, and bodily location of tics. \n\nTics show a number of distinctive features. They often exhibit a classical \u2018waxing and waning\u2019 in severity and presentation over time ( ,  ,  ), and are typically exacerbated by anxiety, stress, and fatigue ( ). Although tics are commonly assumed to be compulsive and \u2018unwilled\u2019, they can be more accurately described as \u2018unvoluntary\u2019, in that an involuntary urge to move can be relieved by a volitional decision to release the tic ( ,  ). These \u2018premonitory\u2019 urges often (though not always) precede tics and occur in up to 90% of adolescents with TS ( ). Such premonitory experiences often take the form of uncomfortable sensory symptoms, and are not only subjectively perceived by patients as a key precursor event in tic expression, but are furthermore associated with greater tic severity, greater functional impairment, and poorer quality of life ( ,  ). \n\nTS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with onset of tics in childhood or adolescence. However, the lifespan trajectory is highly variable: >\u00a050% of people with TS may experience a substantial decline in tic severity by early adulthood; some may undergo complete remission; and some continue to experience tics into adulthood, sometimes accompanied by an increase in tic severity ( ,  ). \n\nThe heterogeneous presentation of TS is reflected not only in the individual expression of tics, but also in the expression of common comorbidities ( ). Perhaps only 10% of TS patients have \u2018pure\u2019 TS (i.e. tics only) ( ). The majority of TS individuals present with comorbidities, i.e. as \u2018TS\u00a0+\u2019. The two most frequent comorbid conditions are obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), each showing comorbidity rates of 30%\u201350% ( ). Arguably tic disorders, OCD, and ADHD share core behavioral and psychological features. Correspondingly, within the brain, there is overlap in putative neuroanatomical substrates, implicating fronto-striatal network dysfunction ( ). However, distinct phenotypes are likely to arise from particular developmental profiles in (epi-) genetic architecture ( ) that determine divergent clinical expression ( ). Affective symptomatology, including depression and anxiety, is also more common among patients with TS than in the general population ( ,  ). \n\nTS is linked to aberrant functioning of several neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Prescribed pharmacotherapies most commonly target dopaminergic transmission, but are not effective in all individuals at reducing tics ( ), further highlighting the heterogeneity of the condition. \n\nTheoretical and empirical knowledge suggests broadly that TS is underpinned by dysfunction within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) motor networks ( ,  ,  ,  ). These circuits underpin habitual motor behavior including the transition of goal-directed action selection to compulsive action ( ,  ). Furthermore, disorders with clear CSTC dysfunction incorporating overlapping symptoms with TS such as compulsivity in OCD ( ), or opponent symptoms such as bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease ( ), highlight the relevance of basal ganglia interactions for tics. Additional cortical and subcortical systems are also implicated in the general expression of TS, including regions supporting motor planning and preparation, executive function, somatosensation and perception ( ,  ,  ). \n\nAlthough there are multiple reported functional differences of neural activity in TS, many are not explicitly linked to expression of particular symptoms. For example, in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm, children and adults with TS show widespread alterations in activity across distributed anatomical areas compared to controls, suggesting non-specific changes in somatosensory gating ( ,  ). In studies examining motor inhibition, of particular relevance to tic suppression, TS patients show functional differences in motor control and motor execution regions ( ,  ), yet it is difficult to determine if these reflect disruption or enhancement of inhibitory control, and may be obfuscated by participants with heterogeneous developmental courses and comorbid ADHD ( ). Finally, abnormal neural activation is reported for TS individuals during simple motor tasks ( ,  ), during mentalization (theory of mind) ( ,  ), and during emotional face perception ( ). However, abnormalities are not consistent: for example, in one study, no differences were observed between adolescents with TS and controls during tests spanning cognitive and motor domains ( ). \n\nTaken together, these findings indicate that functional neuroanatomical differences associated with TS are perhaps subtle, yet extend beyond motor circuitry into neural substrates supporting many domains of cognitive function. Specific functional differences may relate to the core symptoms of tics and premonitory sensations ( ), or reflect facets of common comorbidities ( ), distinct developmental trajectories ( ), or even dysfunction impacting multiple neural systems, such as a tendency towards cortical hyperexcitability ( ). Historically, the assimilation of disparate results from functional neuroimaging studies on TS populations is challenging on account of substantial participant heterogeneity in tic experience, lifespan expression, comorbidity rate, and medication usage ( ). One examination of convergent activations specifically related to tic generation, response inhibition, and voluntary motor execution identified the SMA, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex ( ). However, beyond these specific phenomenological aspects of TS, the different functional systems in which there are potential differences between TS and control populations are reflected in the different cognitive tasks applied by functional imaging studies, and in the neuroanatomical distribution of identified functional changes that extend beyond canonical CSTC networks ( ,  ). \n\nIn the current study, we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the existing neuroimaging literature of task-based fMRI studies in TS populations. We conducted a series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses ( ,  ) to improve statistical power compared to a single study, and capitalize upon evidence from studies with different sample characteristics and experimental designs, to elucidate common neurobiological substrates related to TS. \n\nWe first tested for group differences between TS and control participants in neural activation, across cognitive domains. Next, given the mixed comorbidity samples employed in the literature, we determined which patterns of functional neural reactivity specifically relate to tics (as core TS symptoms), by examining association between neural activations and tic severity score, across the various experimental tasks employed. This combined approach provides an overview of the existing task-based neuroimaging data on TS, and further pinpoints specific functional neuroanatomy alterations that are central to TS, beyond comorbidities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nA literature search on PubMed ( ) was conducted using the following search terms: \u201cTourette\u201d OR \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Only studies that met the following inclusion criteria were considered for analysis:   \nOriginal data are presented (thus, review papers were excluded), \n  \nTourette Syndrome sample was examined (excluding studies on patients with secondary tics after e.g. traumatic brain injury, stroke, encephalitis, and patients with Tourette-like symptoms called Tourettisms), \n  \nStudy included a control group and reports TS vs control contrast(s), \n  \nMethods include task-related fMRI or H2O-PET (excluding e.g. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), behavioral only, and non-task-related fMRI studies such as resting-state fMRI), \n  \nParticipants were not subjected to treatment therapies as part of the experimental manipulation (e.g. deep brain stimulation (DBS) or drug infusion; exception: behavioral therapy), \n  \nWhole-brain analysis was conducted (excluding studies reporting only region of interest (ROI) analyses), \n  \nPeak activation coordinates are reported, \n  \nStudy was conducted with human participants, \n  \nArticle was originally published in English. \n  \n\n provides a detailed illustration of the literature selection process.   \nFlow chart describing the literature selection process. Number of publications (n) and number of individuals (N) are indicated. *We tested all combinations of search terms \u201cTourette\u201d, \u201cTourette Syndrome\u201d, \u201cTourette's Syndrome\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cPET\u201d, \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d. Searches other than those indicated in the figure did not provide additional results. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAs of January 2017, fourteen publications met inclusion criteria for the first ALE analysis examining differences between TS and control participants (see Supplementary Table 1 for references). If otherwise suitable studies did not report activation coordinates, we contacted the authors by e-mail. However, all enquiries remained unsuccessful. Likewise, we contacted the authors of three papers who did not report the age range of the participants ( ,  ,  ) to request these. This information was available for one study ( ). The age of the participants from the other two studies ( ,  ) is therefore described with the mean and standard deviation, as reported within the original publications. The following information was recorded for each study: first author and year of publication, neuroimaging method (fMRI\/H2O-PET), task domain, brief task description and contrast(s) entered to the ALE, sample size of TS and control groups, age range of TS participants (in all studies, case and control participants were age-matched), number of TS participants with comorbid OCD and ADHD, and their medication status ( ). Notably, if two studies presented different data acquired from the same sample, both were included as separate experiments ( ,  ).   \nStudies included in the ALE meta-analysis examining differences in activations between TS participants and controls. \n  Table 1       \n\nTwo studies ( ,  ) found no difference between the TS and control groups and were thus entered into the meta-analysis with no coordinates. Three other studies ( ,  ,  ) conducted an ANOVA analysis, and we selected information equivalent to the TS vs control contrast from reported main effects and interactions. Interactions were only used if the direction of the effect was clearly described, and relevant to group differences. For example, in a study of prepulse inhibition in TS and control participants, a reported Task\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interaction reflected activation differences between TS and control groups for the contrast of PPI trials compared to \u2018pulse alone\u2019 trials ( ). In addition, some articles provided more than one analysis comparing TS and control participants. For example, in a study of finger tapping, TS and control participants were compared on finger tapping with the right hand in one analysis, and on finger tapping with the left hand in another ( ). These contrasts were included in the meta-analysis as separate experiments. Contrasts examining decreases [TS\u00a0<\u00a0control] and increases [TS\u00a0>\u00a0control] in activation for the TS group were pooled and included in one experiment as [TS vs control]. The final selection of publications provided 25 experiments, 311 foci, and a total of 651 participants. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: TS vs controls group difference \n  \nFirst, we examined differences in activations between TS participants and controls. The meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.3.6. ( ). The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm treats the reported foci of included studies as spatial probability distributions centered on the given coordinates ( ,  ). The width of the distribution depends on empirical estimates of between-subject and between-template variability, also accounting for the sample size of each experiment. Further, a \u2018modelled activation\u2019 (MA) map is computed by merging the probability distributions of all foci reported in the respective experiment. The ALE image is then produced by taking the union of all MA maps in a voxel-wise manner. The algorithm subsequently searches for above-chance convergence of activation probabilities between experiments. This allows for a random-effect analysis, as opposed to considering between-foci convergence that would produce a fixed-effects analysis, thereby permitting generalization of the results to experiments not included in the meta-analysis. Finally, the results are tested against a null distribution that assumes random spatial association between experiments. Our approach therefore followed the details of established ALE methodology ( ). \n\nStereotactic brain coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using Talairach to MNI (SPM) conversion as implemented in GingerALE. Default settings were used with the exception of setting the ALE Method to \u201cTurkeltaub Non-Additive\u201d, which controls within-experiment effects by limiting probability values of neighboring foci from the same experiment. This is achieved using the maximum probability associated with a given focus (as opposed to using the union of the probabilities) for computing the MA map ( ). The ALE map was thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected with a minimum cluster volume of 100\u00a0mm  ( ,  ). The ALE map was displayed using MRIcron ( ), and anatomical labeling was guided by the Anatomy toolbox 2.2b ( ) for SPM12 ( ,  ), and the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas ( ) in FSL ( ). \n\n#### TS vs controls group difference: additional task-based studies employing region of interest (ROI) approaches \n  \nFour studies that otherwise met inclusion criteria employed an ROI analysis method whereby the whole-brain effect of task, for both TS and control participants, was used to define a \u2018task ROI\u2019 to which a small volume correction was applied when interrogating the group difference between TS and control participants. These four studies therefore did not meet our strict inclusion criteria in that they do not perform a whole-brain analysis when comparing the TS group to controls. However, we acknowledge the contribution of these studies to the published literature on TS. We therefore conducted an exploratory ALE meta-analysis that incorporated these additional four studies, including contrasts that examined the group difference within task ROIs. These additional four studies are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 and references listed in Supplementary Table 3. All ALE procedures were the same as for the primary group difference analysis (above). The results did not substantially change the clusters in the resulting ALE map (Supplementary Table 5) and therefore will not be further discussed. \n\n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis: tic severity \n  \nWe next examined the relationship between activations and tic severity in TS. We conducted a second ALE meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies that reported activation coordinates for correlations with tic severity in TS participants. Suitable studies were identified using the aforementioned inclusion criteria (see  ). We discarded all criteria regarding the control group, as they bare no relevance to symptom severity analyses. As a result, 7 fMRI publications ( ) met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, one of which ( ) found no correlation with symptom severity, and was thus used with no coordinates. Together, these articles provided information about 8 experiments with 23 foci and 378 participants. All studies measured tic severity with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). The reference list of the publications included in this tic severity meta-analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4. ALE procedures were the same as for the group difference analysis ( ).   \nStudies included in the meta-analysis examining correlations with tic severity in TS.

Fourteen activation clusters were identified in the resulting ALE image ( ). TS participants showed differences in activations in lateral prefrontal cortex, including the inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri; anterior cingulate cortex; lateral premotor cortex (precentral gyrus); supplementary motor area (SMA); posterior superior temporal sulcus; the supramarginal gyrus; retrosplenial cortex; secondary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus); and the lingual gyrus.

Furthermore, we tested for task activation patterns that specifically relate to core TS symptoms, by examining correlations with tic severity within TS patients. Group differences were identified in functional systems including prefrontal and motor preparation areas; sensory-perceptual (somatosensory and visual) areas; and parieto-temporal association cortices. Importantly, however, only prefrontal and motor preparation regions predicted tic severity, suggesting specificity of task-based neural reactivity within these areas to the core symptomatology of TS. \n\nThese results support a core dysfunction of CSTC motor loops in TS that specifically underpins the expression of tics ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, more generalized CSTC dysfunction may account for alterations across neuroanatomical systems predisposing individuals to the heterogeneity of intrinsic symptoms and the multifaceted nature of neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities within the TS spectrum ( ,  ). \n\n### Anatomically widespread alterations in neural function in TS \n  \nThe neuroimaging studies of TS included in the meta-analyses were task-based studies that represented multiple experimental paradigms across cognitive domains. These included motor execution tasks, for example finger tapping ( ,  ,  ,  ), motor inhibition tasks, for example the stop signal and Go\/No-Go tasks ( ,  ), executive function challenges, for example the Stroop task ( ,  ), probes of somatosensory gating, for example the prepulse (PPI) inhibition paradigm ( ,  ), theory of mind tasks ( ,  ), and responses to emotional faces ( ). These neuroimaging investigations highlight the diversity of cognitive processes that are putatively altered in TS, which our first meta-analysis demonstrates are correspondingly reflected in differences in neural function, distributed anatomically across multiple neural systems. \n\nTics are fundamentally motor symptoms, and several motor execution and inhibition studies were included in the meta-analysis. We therefore anticipated that evidence for motor circuit dysfunction would be identified: specifically, the meta-analysis highlighted cortical dysregulation within the motor preparation regions SMA and premotor cortex. We discuss the implications for understanding the dysfunction of these regions in reference to the tic severity ALE analysis in  . \n\nThe analysis of group differences also highlighted prefrontal clusters, encompassing all three frontal gyri. A high proportion of the included studies tested patients with comorbid ADHD and\/or OCD, in which prefrontal dysfunction and associated executive deficits are likely core elements ( ,  ,  ). Thus, these prefrontal clusters may in part reflect the presence of, or predisposition to, these comorbid conditions in TS individuals. \n\nSomatosensory features are important elements to the general experience of TS. Premonitory sensations frequently precede tics ( ,  ). These are often described as feelings of \u2018itch\u2019 or \u2018pressure\u2019, and typically show a somato-homuncular coupling to the bodily location at which the tic subsequently emerges ( ). Our meta-analysis confirmed differences in the functional reactivity of somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus) in TS compared to controls, indicating how somatomotor control through cortico-cortical interaction might underpin the experiential expression of TS. \n\nHowever, it is notable that the insula was not identified. Although the task-based studies included in our analysis did not explicitly test the neurobiological mechanisms of premonitory phenomena, the insula has been proposed as a core site of sensory symptom generation ( ,  ,  ), and structural neuroimaging has confirmed severity of premonitory phenomena is associated with both somatosensory and insular cortices ( ,  ). It is possible that while the insula is indeed a likely generator of sensory symptoms, it was not detected in our meta-analyses because task-based studies of TS to date have not typically employed paradigms testing bodily processing that are likely to activate the insula, such as interoceptive tasks ( ). Regardless of task nature, however, it would be useful if future task-based fMRI studies reported sensory symptom severity associations, as many studies in the existing literature do for tic severity, so that future meta-analyses can confirm if functional reactivity of the insula, alongside somatosensory cortex, are associated with this dimension of TS symptom expression. Of note, one resting-state fMRI study has already indicated that strength of insula interactions with SMA is associated with premonitory phenomena severity ( ). \n\nSensorimotor coupling and the priming of motor responses by sensation extends beyond proprioception and touch. Although the processing and representation of visual information has rarely been studied in TS, several visual processes appear to operate differently. Visual field ( ) and colour vision ( ) deficits are both described in TS. Interestingly, the group difference analysis identified a cluster within lingual gyrus in the region of the colour perception area, V4. In addition, there are indications that perception of complex visual stimuli, namely facial expressions, is altered in TS. Participants with TS may show greater amygdala activation to emotional faces ( ), a possible driver for echopraxic facial tics, which more generally, highlights the influence of salient environmental stimuli on the sensitivity of people with TS to potential stressors ( ), including social emotional cues. Furthermore, a tendency for people with TS to engage in mental state reasoning, even when not explicitly required, may also promote greater neural reactivity in response to social and emotional cues ( ). While our meta-analysis cannot explicitly test for such mechanisms, group differences were observed across temporo-parietal areas implicated in own bodily self-consciousness, perception of others, and perspective taking; these included the posterior superior temporal sulcus, the supramarginal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex ( ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nOur first analysis demonstrated the presence of differences in cortical reactivity in TS, distributed across anatomically widespread neural systems. These differences may account for the wider set of cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms of the TS spectrum. Moreover it remains plausible that, in TS, a common process affecting cortical reactivity (e.g. compromised CSTC control) underpins these observations, with variable expression beyond the critical impact on tics. We therefore focused next on patterns of brain reactivity that might underpin the specific experience of tics in TS. \n\n\n### Tic severity is specifically associated with prefrontal and premotor activity \n  \nRegardless of comorbidities, developmental stage, or medication status, one symptom that all individuals with TS have in common is the expression of tics. We therefore performed an ALE meta-analysis to determine which regions show a specific relationship between task activity and tic severity. A subset of premotor and prefrontal regions, encompassing the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and middle frontal gyrus were identified, indicating that the greater participants' tic severity, the greater the functional alterations in these regions. This corroborates the role of the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex in CSTC circuit dysfunction in TS ( ,  ,  ,  ). In addition, these data demonstrate the close relationship between prefrontal cortex function and tic expression, which may relate to inhibitory tic suppression strategies ( ), and influence the degree of plasticity in adaptive prefrontal regulation of motor responses ( ,  ). The importance of SMA and prefrontal cortex for tic generation, tic suppression, and voluntary action was highlighted by   in an examination of activation clusters related to these particular phenomenological aspects of TS. \n\nInterestingly, we did not observe any clusters within subcortical regions within this meta-analysis. Basal ganglia nuclei clearly play a role in tic expression ( ,  ) and are altered in structural morphology ( ,  ). The thalamus also has a critical role within CSTC circuitry ( ), and is a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation ( ). In addition, there is evidence for TS-related structural and functional differences of the amygdala ( ,  ). That these subcortical structures were not identified in either the group difference or tic severity ALE analyses may reflect methodological insensitivity and the focus on task-based activation studies. Firstly, the particular subtractions used in these task-based studies may be less sensitive towards subcortical responses in whole-brain analyses. Secondly, although several studies employed paradigms relating to motor function, such as finger tapping, they did not examine symptom expression per se, other than broad correlations with tic severity. Thirdly, neurovascular coupling and the BOLD response differ in cortical and subcortical brain areas, with the result that neuroimaging studies may be more sensitive to group differences in cortical areas in general ( ,  ). Finally, the ALE methodology itself employs assumptions which may diminish the sensitivity of the analysis to detect results in subcortical regions (see   below). \n\n\n### ALE limitations \n  \nIn establishing the pool of appropriate studies from the current TS neuroimaging literature for meta-analysis inclusion, a number of issues became apparent that have implications for the interpretation of our ALE results. We applied stringent selection criteria, requiring all studies to have conducted whole-brain analyses, report peak co-ordinates, and employed both a TS and a control group. Despite the burgeoning number of task-based neuroimaging investigations of TS, unfortunately, many did not meet these basic criteria: most often, authors had not reported whole-brain investigations, and instead reported only group differences within pre-selected ROIs, negating the opportunity for the data to contribute to a meta-analysis, as this would a priori bias probability distributions produced by GingerALE towards the ROI foci. \n\nThis has two important implications. Firstly, our results do not encompass the entirety of available literature. Secondly, there appears to be a methodological tendency in a portion of task-based investigations of TS to examine specific regions-of-interest assumed to be of relevance for TS, or known to be important for the task. This contrasts with the use of whole-brain analyses that report which regions reach criterion threshold. The impact on meta-analytic investigations is that if non-significant whole-brain results are not reported, we are unable to enter that study to ALE analysis with zero co-ordinates. Thus, the group differences that we identify may be inflated. Therefore, even when ROIs are selected in clear relevance to the participant group and paradigms employed, we suggest it is helpful for future interpretation, and the pursuit of meta-analytic insights, that authors consistently report whole-brain statistical tests \u2013 even if non-significant \u2013 alongside ROI data. \n\nThe fact that (significant) whole-brain analyses are not more frequently reported may also reflect the subtle nature of differences in brain function in the neurodevelopmental disorder TS, when compared to neurodegenerative disorders (such as Parkinson's disease,  ). Indeed, beyond task-based fMRI investigations ( ,  ,  ), neuroimaging studies of TS have not always revealed significant differences, including voxel-based morphology (VBM) studies of brain morphology ( ,  ,  ); PET studies of striatal dopamine binding potential ( ,  ), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of GABA concentration ( ). This inconsistency in findings may be partly explained by heterogeneity of TS samples, including differences in sample size and variability in patient characteristics, in addition to differences in MRI hardware and methodology ( ). \n\nThe application of meta-analyses can provide powerful overviews of disparate literature. However, to draw robust conclusions, the extent of contributing literature matters. For task-based fMRI data analysed with GingerALE, in general, a sample size of approximately 20 studies is likely to yield sufficient power for moderate effects ( ). In our sample size of 14 studies, we identified multiple clusters of differences and effects in TS. However, these did not reach significance at the most conservative thresholds for multiple comparisons correction. We therefore present our results with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, we identified an additional 7 studies that did not meet our stringent inclusion criterion for whole-brain analyses, and a further 6 studies that did not report activation coordinates. To test the impact of some of these otherwise eligible studies, we performed an additional exploratory analysis in which we included four task-ROI studies. Importantly, however, our results were not substantially different. Greater power and interpretive insight than was possible at present will benefit from future reporting of neuroimaging results within the TS literature at whole-brain thresholds, alongside more detailed reporting of clinical severity associations such as premonitory phenomena. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nFuture neuroimaging studies should carefully consider the complex presentation of TS, as the large proportion of individuals with comorbid disorders ( ) may bias comparisons to unaffected participants ( ,  ). The direct comparison of \u2018pure\u2019 TS patients, TS participants with comorbidities, and control participants, will be of particular value, yet requires sufficient sample sizes. Medication status is another important aspect which should similarly be dealt with, by comparisons between medicated and medication-free patients, given that medication can modulate cognitive function and behavior ( ). Even in the case of smaller, mixed samples, the accurate reporting of the presence and severity of comorbidities will refine interpretation across the imaging literature. \n\nAn increased interest in resting-state fMRI studies of TS is apparent, as is evident in publications from 2014 to 2015 ( ). However, our examination of the current fMRI literature on TS highlights the need for further task-related fMRI, reporting whole-brain results, to provide unique data on evoked neural reactivity that can complement and inform the interpretation of resting-state functional connectivity datasets. The constrained use of ROI analysis can be valuable for testing specific hypotheses regarding putative neural mechanisms, yet the approach can lead to an overrepresentation of selected brain regions within the literature, and underrepresentation of others ( ). This circumvents the ideal application of meta-analytic approaches, since ROI studies introduce a priori increases in the likelihood of identified foci. Finally, network analysis methods, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM) ( ), permit greater insight into mechanistic pathways of dysfunction beyond increases or decreases in regional activity. These approaches hold the potential for unveiling network integration changes, even if no activation differences are found within individual nodes of the network ( ,  ). Thus, even if only subtle univariate results are observed, it is possible to reveal disorder-specific effects. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nUsing GingerALE meta-analysis, we found differences in neural activity in TS across multiple regions of neocortex, encompassing motor, somatosensory, and perceptual systems. However, only premotor and prefrontal areas were specific to the core expression of tics in TS. This accords with models of CSTC circuit dysfunction as fundamentally underpinning aspects of TS. The heterogeneity of TS, and methodological limitations within the existing task-based neuroimaging literature, invite future investigations to carefully delineate their sample populations and analysis reports. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5554925,"text_md5":"1fbd5ea93ccc72342bb3006019686809","field_positions":{"authors":[0,63],"journal":[64,79],"publication_year":[81,85],"title":[96,233],"keywords":[247,367],"abstract":[380,2829],"body":[2838,38816]},"batch":1,"pmid":28831377,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2017.08.004","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5554925","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5554925"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5554925\">5554925<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5554925  Centrality of prefrontal and motor preparation cortices to Tourette Syndrome revealed by meta-analysis of task-based neuroimaging studies"}

In order to quantitatively assess this overlap, we conducted a series of coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA) of results from 466 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on task-negative or subjective value-related activations in the human brain. In these analyses, we first identified significant overlaps and dissociations across activation foci related to SVN and DMN. Second, we investigated whether these overlapping subregions also showed similar patterns of functional connectivity, suggesting a shared functional subnetwork. We find considerable overlap between SVN and DMN in subregions of central ventromedial prefrontal cortex (cVMPFC) and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC). Further, our findings show that similar patterns of bidirectional functional connectivity between cVMPFC and dPCC are present in both networks. We discuss ways in which our understanding of how subjective value (SV) is computed and represented in the brain can be synthesized with what we know about the DMN, mind-wandering, and self-referential processing in light of our findings. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSignificant progress has been made in understanding the anatomy and function of the default mode network (DMN), which is characterized by robust task-induced decreases in activity in a consistent set of brain regions as well as robust correlations in activity during rest (Raichle and Snyder,  ). Recently, the relation between the DMN and other previously identified functional networks for distinct cognitive processes has attracted increasing interest. This interest is in part driven by the fact that a variety of cognitive tasks reliably induce increased activity in DMN-associated regions, as opposed to the expected task-induced decreases in DMN activity. Cognitive processes that have been identified to elicit activity in DMN regions include emotional and social cognition, introspection, prospection, and autobiographical memory (Laird et al.,  ). These investigations have been valuable, as they provide insights into DMN function, which can help us understand what our brains are doing when we are \u201cdoing nothing\u201d and how our brains deviate from this default state in response to task demands. \n\nHere we focus on another set of cognitive processes that have been shown to entail task-driven increases of activity in a subset of DMN-related regions, namely value-based decision making. Specifically, a qualitative look at studies and reviews demonstrating the presence of a distinct network that plays a crucial role in the computation and representation of subjective value (SV) in value-based decision making (the subjective value network [SVN]) suggests overlaps with DMN in a number of regions core to both networks (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). The goal of the present research is to quantitatively assess the nature and extent of overlap between the SVN and DMN. In doing so, we aim to synthesize our understanding of how SV is computed and represented in the brain with what we know about the DMN. We begin by shortly reviewing the separate literatures on each of these networks. \n\nUnderstanding how the brain makes decisions and evaluates their outcomes is a core focus of neuroeconomics (Clithero and Rangel,  ). A crucial step in the computational process of decision making is the assignment of value to the set of alternatives that is relevant to the decision at hand (Rangel et al.,  ). The need to make value-based decisions is shared across many animal species, as value-based decision making is necessary for simple animal behaviors like foraging as much as it is necessary for complex economic decisions made by humans in financial markets (Hayden et al.,  ). \n\nThere is consensus in the neuroeconomics literature around the presence of a distinct brain network responsible for the valuation process. The literature has provided strong evidence from both human and animal studies that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) is involved in the assessment of SV (Rangel and Hare,  ; Levy and Glimcher,  ). The large corpus of publications and the variability of decision making contexts used in this line of research proves a challenge for the identification of a core brain network responsible for the computation of SV. Qualitative reviews of the literature (Rangel et al.,  ; Padoa-Schioppa,  ) have proven useful, but a recent and highly informative trend has been conducting large coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA) in order to assess the full set of brain regions that correlate with the SV of potential actions across task and reward modalities (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). \n\nTwo recent meta-analyses targeting the neuroeconomics literature with respect to the computation and representation of SV suggest that a core set of regions reliably co-activate and represent SV across task stages and outcome modalities, consisting of VMPFC, VSTR, and PCC (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). This set of functionally connected regions, suggesting the presence of a distinct SVN in the brain, is further consistent with numerous qualitative reviews of the literature (Rangel et al.,  ; Glimcher,  ; Grabenhorst and Rolls,  ; Padoa-Schioppa,  ). \n\nResearchers outside neuroeconomics pursuing a variety of research programs in neuroimaging have observed reliable decreases in brain activity in a distinct set of brain regions during engagement in mental tasks (Raichle et al.,  ). These findings have attracted interest in the structure and function of this network, coined the DMN (Raichle and Snyder,  ). Beyond task-related decreases, DMN has also been associated with increased activity during internally focused tasks involving self-referential thought, such as prospection, theory of mind, and autobiographical memory retrieval (Buckner et al.,  ). The withdrawal of activity from regions involved in the DMN, which include the VMPFC, PCC, precuneus (pC) inferior parietal lobule (IPL), lateral temporal cortex (LTF), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been interpreted as the attenuation of internally focused, self-referential activity in the brain in order to better focus on the external demands of the environment and the task at hand (Sheline et al.,  ). \n\nThe relationship between DMN and other cognitive processes that lead to task-induced increases in DMN regions has recently attracted considerable interest. However, these investigations have mostly been focused on a specific group of cognitive processes most salient with our current conceptualization of the DMN. For example, Spreng et al. ( ) find common activation with DMN areas across autobiographical memory, prospection, and theory of mind tasks, concluding that the DMN supports the common denominator of these cognitive behaviors, which is the simulation of an internalized experience. The exact functional diversity and architecture of the DMN is far from understood. However, the regions involved in DMN are well defined and there is growing consensus that DMN plays a role in internally focused, self-referential processing that allows us to process our past and prepare for our future (Buckner and Vincent,  ; Raichle and Snyder,  ). \n\nA noteworthy take on understanding the functional heterogeneity of the DMN using a meta-analytic approach is provided by Laird et al. ( ). Combining CBMA with behavioral domain and functional connectivity analyses, the authors build upon the insight that DMN may be responsible for not one, but multiple functions (Spreng et al.,  ). This insight is warranted given the task induced increases (as opposed to the expected decreases) in DMN regions during tasks used for studying processes, such as emotional and social cognition, decision making, introspection, prospection, and autobiographical memory (Laird et al.,  ). \n\nOne set of cognitive processes that drive activation in core DMN regions is related to value-based decision making (Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). However, the relation between the computation of SV in the brain (by the SVN) and the DMN has not been in empirical focus. Chavez et al. ( ) recently demonstrated that a classifier model built to distinguish positive and negative affective responses can also distinguish self-referential processing from thinking about others, most prominently in the VMPFC. This result is interesting to us as it links affective processes that are core to the SVN and value-based decision making to self-referential processing, which is widely considered as part of DMN function. In fact, two critical nodes of the DMN, namely VMPFC, and PCC, are also considered crucial in value-based decision making, as reviewed above. However, no publication to date has assessed the exact overlap in DMN and SVN-related activity across these regions. Understanding the overlap as well as dissociations between DMN and SVN within these regions can guide future research on how DMN and SVN are related, can inform our conceptualization of how SV is represented in the brain, and can improve our understanding of DMN function. \n\nFor these reasons, we conducted a series of CBMA's, addressing the questions about (1) whether and where there may be overlaps and dissociations across the SVN and DMN and (2) whether these overlapping regions also show similar patterns of functional connectivity within these networks. There are distinct advantages to using a CBMA-based approach in this investigation. A CBMA allows the definition of the exact extent of overlap between different domains, in addition to identifying subregions within regions of interests where these networks can be dissociated. In this case, it allows us to test whether there is complete overlap in VMPFC and PCC across DMN and SV-related activations, or whether there are distinct subregional specializations within VMPFC and PCC for both DMN and SVN. When combined with meta-analytic connectivity modeling, this approach can further shed light to functional connectivity between potentially overlapping subregions (in other words, overlapping functional subnetworks) across the two networks. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \nWe report the results from a series of CBMA, a widely used methodology in the neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ; Kober and Wager,  ). We conducted CBMA using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fox and Friston,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). This approach is utilized in order to assess correspondence of neuroimaging results at the voxel level across a large number of studies (Laird et al.,  ). This methodology provides a test of the null hypothesis that activations reported in a set of studies are uniformly distributed across the brain, rather than concentrating in a subset of regions (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nBoth the SVN and DMN have previously been subject to CBMA in separate contexts, aimed at identifying informatic parcellation within each network (Laird et al.,  ; Bartra et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). Qualitative and subjective observations of regional overlap between SVN and DMN have been noted in the recent literature (Clithero and Rangel,  ), especially in VMPFC and PCC, regions that are associated with both networks. In this paper, we use the CBMA approach to provide a quantitative and objective assessment of whether there is such an overlap across these two networks and whether there are specialized subregions for each network within VMPFC and PCC. In addition to assessing overlaps in regional involvement across these two networks, we further assess overlapping patterns of functional connectivity using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (Laird et al.,  ; Robinson et al.,  ). \n\n### 2.1. Selection criteria for CBMA \n  \nFor the SVN dataset, we acquired (kindly provided by the authors) the results of a PubMed search for \u201cfMRI\u201d and \u201creward\u201d conducted by Bartra et al. ( ), which was filtered based on a number of selection criteria. Sampling only English language papers that used BOLD fMRI, the authors excluded studies that use physical pain as a negative outcome, or those that use psychoactive drugs as a positive outcome. Further, they required that the study results reported a directional change in BOLD with respect to SV in the experimental task in stereotactic space (Talairach or MNI). The dataset excluded results based on region-of-interest (ROI) or small-volume-correction (SVC) analyses, such that the results under consideration involved the same threshold being applied uniformly across the whole brain. Finally, results included were only from healthy human participants (results in any given study corresponding to a patient population of interest were also excluded). See Bartra et al. ( ) for more details on selection criteria. This dataset provided by the authors included 348 studies from 206 publications. This corpus of publications used a wide variety of experimental tasks with varying elements of choice, risk, learning, and numerous different outcomes, including rewards and penalties in primary, monetary, social, and other contexts (Bartra et al.,  ). We converted the subset of results reported in Talairach space to MNI space using the Lancaster (icbm2tal) transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ). \n\nFor the DMN dataset, we conducted a BrainMap search using the same search criteria used in Laird et al. ( ) to access published task independent activations, using Sleuth 2.3. The search criteria were (1) \u201cNormal Mapping\u201d context (healthy participants only), (2) \u201cLow-Level Control\u201d experimental controls (resting or fixation conditions only), and (3) \u201cDeactivations\u201d (contrasts in which the signal during baseline was greater than during task). The matching results, all extracted in MNI stereotactic coordinates, included 181 studies from 89 publications. Thus, this dataset of contrasts involving regions more active at \u201crest\u201d compared to \u201ctask\u201d spanned a wide variety of paradigms. \n\nWe queried and transformed the provided spreadsheet of SV data from Bartra et al. ( ) into GingerALE input format using a custom Python script (accessible at  ). We included activation foci for only positive SV effects, omitting contrasts involving deactivations in response to increasing SV. Further, we excluded activation foci from the \u201cwait\u201d stage activations (activity between decision stage and outcome receipt stage), leaving only activations during decision and outcome. We included all outcome types (monetary, primary, and others). This resulted in an ALE input including 2942 foci from 285 experiments. For the BrainMap search results for DMN data, we used 1577 foci from all 181 experiments. \n\n\n### 2.2. ALE meta-analysis \n  \nA widely used method in the literature, the ALE approach to conducting CBMA's involves testing against the null hypothesis that activation foci in the dataset are distributed uniformly across the brain, thus looking for regions with above chance concentration of activity across studies (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). In other words, the ALE approach provides for each voxel in the brain an activation likelihood estimate, which is the probability that at least one activation focus from the set of experiments truly lies at that voxel based on Gaussian principles of spatial uncertainty (Bartra et al.,  ). \n\nThe computation of ALE statistics involves three main steps. First, the probability of activation in any given voxel is computed as a function of three variables: the Euclidean distance between the reported peak coordinates and the voxel, the volume of the voxel (8mm  here), and the spatial uncertainty associated with the reported peak coordinates. These are mapped onto a modeled activation map (MA). Second, MA maps are aggregated across contrasts by taking the probabilistic union of the MA statistic across all contrasts for each voxel, returning the ALE statistic. Finally, a permutation test is used to identify voxels where the ALE statistic is higher than that expected by chance (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). We performed the ALE analyses in MNI space, using GingerALE 2.3.5 for the CBMA and GingerALE 2.3.6 for connectivity modeling. \n\nWe started by computing two ALE maps for DMN and SVN data sets separately, thresholding the ALE map with a voxel-level requirement of   p   < 0.001 and a cluster-level requirement of   p   < 0.05. The significance levels of ALE values were determined by comparing the resulting ALE statistics to a null distribution generated from 10, 000 permutations as outlined above. \n\nSecond, we carried out contrasts between the results from the individual analyses of SVN and DMN datasets in order to determine if there were any differences in the spatial pattern of loci across the two ALE maps. This analysis resulted in a conjunction map indicating regions of overlap, as well as two contrast maps indicating dissociable regions where either SVN or DMN was more correlated with the reported loci. Differences between ALE maps were also compared to a null distribution generated by 10, 000 permutations in order to generate   p  -values, and we implemented a false discovery rate (FDR) correction at the voxel-level for the   p  -values at the   p   < 0.05 level. \n\nAfter determining the location of regional overlaps between the DMN and SVN using the approach explained above, we used meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) in order to investigate whether thee functional connectivity patterns of these overlapping regions also overlap across the two networks. By assessing groups of coordinates that co-activate across a large number of experiments, CBMA's can be used to identify functionally connected networks in the brain. This is done by identifying the specific ROI, seeding these regions of interest back to the original data sets in order to identify all other studies and their foci that also reported activation within the ROI, and computing ALE statistics for only this subset of foci. Put simply, the meta-analytic approach and the statistical procedure remains the same, but applied only on a subset of the corpus of studies that report activation within the ROI. Based on assessing the spatial co-occurrence of spatially separate neurophysiological events, this approach can be used to identify functional connectivity (Rogers et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). This approach has been used previously to assess the functional connectivity of the amygdala (Robinson et al.,  ), and informatic parcellation in both the DMN (Laird et al.,  ) and the SVN (Clithero and Rangel,  ). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nAll results reported here can be accessed as unthresholded ALE maps online (accessible at  ). The results for single-domain analyses for SVN and DMN were consistent with previous analyses in the original papers by Bartra et al. ( ) and Laird et al. ( ), as well as the findings of a number of other meta-analyses on both research domains in the literature (Schilbach et al.,  ; Clithero and Rangel,  ). Moreover, the comparisons made between SVN and DMN-related activity by the contrasts and conjunction between the two ALE maps demonstrated overlaps and dissociations within regions involved in both DMN and SVN. Finally, the meta-analytic connectivity analyses found evidence for functional connectivity between PCC and VMPFC in both networks. Specifically, PCC activity was associated with wide regional co-activations within VMPFC, while VMPFC activity alone was associated with relatively limited volumes of PCC co-activation, indicating some asymmetry in the functional connectivity between VMPFC and PCC. \n\n### 3.1. Subjective value \n  \nThe CBMA found five clusters of convergence significantly correlated with increasing SV across all included studies. These regions included the striatum, bilateral amygdala, VMPFC, dorsal and ventral PCC, in addition to the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in a large cluster containing striatum, VMPFC, and dACC (ALE = 251.5 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n\nThe only region where our results, as well as Bartra et al. ( )'s results, diverge from Clithero and Rangel ( )'s findings on the SVN is the activity found in the left SFG; but it is worth noting that this cluster disappears with the use of only slightly more stringent thresholding, suggesting that it is not as robust as the other results reported here. \n\n\n### 3.2. Default mode network \n  \nThe CBMA of DMN foci suggested a large number of clusters, including the pC, PCC, DMPFC, VMPFC, bilateral IPL, bilateral MTG, left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral hippocampus, claustrum, and striatum. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 79.8 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n\nUnlike Laird et al. ( ), we do find convergence in the hippocampus in DMN, which may reflect the availability of more than a dozen new studies relevant to our search criteria in the BrainMap database compared to 2009. This suggests that the increased power of the analysis with added studies may have resolved some issues concerning susceptibility artifacts or high spatial variability associated with task related deactivations in this area. \n\nOne exception to the convergence between our results and Laird et al. ( ) is the presence of small clusters in the striatum, which could have arisen from the less stringent thresholding used here. However, the main purpose of the present investigation is not the single-domain analyses, but an analysis of regions related to both SVN and DMN; thus, the application of less conservative thresholding at this stage was warranted by our purpose of assessing overlaps between the two networks. The second round of thresholding during the contrast analyses helps increase the stringency of results to compensate for these less stringent thresholds at the first stage. \n\n\n### 3.3. SVN-DMN conjunction and contrasts \n  \nThe conjunction analysis of SVN and DMN ALE maps revealed eight clusters in regions of overlapping activity across these two networks. These clusters were in VMPFC, striatum, ventral and dorsal PCC, and bilateral amygdala. The overlap cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 64.4 \u00d7 10 ). These results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of CBMA results for SVN and DMN  . \n  \n The analysis identified eight distinct clusters of overlap using ALE. Results are shown in Figure   . \n    \n Conjunctions and contrasts of DMN and SVN using CBMA  . For assessing functional specialization for DMN or SVN, we contrasted their ALE images, which are reported as z-scores (in blue for DMN specialization or red for SVN specialization). The overlaps were assessed by the conjunction of the DMN and SVN ALE images and are reported as ALE scores (in purple). Overlaps across the two networks were found in VMPFC, striatum, ventral and dorsal PCC, and bilateral amygdala. The overlap cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the VMPFC (ALE = 64.4 \u00d7 10 ). Coordinates and cluster information for the conjunction are listed in Table  . \n  \nThe two especially surprising results are the overlaps found in striatum and amygdala. Both of these regions, despite being closely involved in valuation-related processes (Hare et al.,  ; Seymour and Dolan,  ), are not considered core parts of the DMN. \n\nFurthermore, these results demonstrate that two main areas of interest that are widely considered parts of both the SVN and the DMN, namely VMPFC and PCC, diverge in the amount of overlap observed across these two domains. A large proportion of MPFC, clustered around central ventromedial prefrontal cortex (cVMPFC), shows non-specialization across the SVN and DMN, with only a small part of aVMPFC activating selectively in the SV dataset. In dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), there is also considerable overlap between SVN and DMN, while a number of clusters in the more ventral areas of PCC activate selectively in the DMN contrasts. These results indicate that while activity in especially more central regions of the VMPFC is hardly dissociable across these two networks, there seems to be some regional specialization for DMN in PCC. Meanwhile, the areas of PCC that the SVN recruits almost completely overlap with DMN-associated activity in the PCC. \n\nThere were multiple clusters in the LMTG, RMTG, PCC, and pC where the likelihood of activation (DMN-SVN contrast) was greater for DMN than SVN (See Figure  ). On the other hand, activity in one large cluster centered in the striatum extending to thalamus and hypothalamus, as well as some small clusters in insula, anterior VMPFC (aVMPFC), and SFG were more correlated with SVN than DMN (SVN-DMN contrast, see Figure  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling \n  \nOf specific interest, supported by the results of the first step of our analysis, was the regional overlap between the default mode and SVN around VMPFC and PCC. For this reason, for each network, we investigated the set of areas that exhibit reliable co-activation with VMPFC and PCC. We hypothesized that VMPFC and PCC might demonstrate functional connectivity with each other in both networks. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two spherical 12 mm ROIs near the cVMPFC and dPCC, based on regions exhibiting local maxima in the results of the earlier analyses. The VMPFC ROI was centered at (  x,y,z  ) = (\u22122, 44, \u22124) and the dPCC ROI was centered at (  x,y,z  ) = (\u22122, \u221236, 38). Then, we subsetted the corpus of studies to only include studies reporting activation foci within these ROIs. The VMPFC ROI identified 487 foci from 31 experiments in the DMN dataset, and 772 foci from 69 experiments in the SV dataset. The dPCC ROI identified 424 foci from 27 experiments in the DMN dataset, and 450 foci from 36 experiments in the SV dataset. \n\nThe areas that showed co-activation with VMPFC in DMN were primarily dPCC, vPCC, pC, and the amygdala. In addition, other clusters of co-activation were found in bilateral MTG, RIPL, LMFG, striatum, and right supramarginal gyrus (RSMG). The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC was in the dPCC (ALE = 31.4 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . On the other hand, in SVN, co-activations with VMPFC were found in the striatum, dPCC, vPCC, LMFG, right insula, and thalamus. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC was in the striatum (ALE = 103.3 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . A conjunction analysis of these two co-activation maps revealed 9 clusters of overlap, including dPCC, vPCC, striatum, bilateral MFG, and left amgydala. The maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC in this conjunction was found in dPCC (ALE = 20.1 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of MACM results for SVN and DMN looking at functional connectivity with VMPFC  . \n  \n The analysis identified nine distinct clusters of overlap using ALE, eight outside of the VMPFC seed. Results are shown in Figure   . \n    \n Conjunctions and contrasts of DMN and SVN using MACM, focusing on functional connectivity with VMPFC  . For assessing connectivity patterns that were specific to DMN or SVN, we contrasted their ALE images, which are reported as z-scores (in blue for DMN-specific connectivity or red for SVN-specific connectivity). The overlaps in functional connectivity assessed by the conjunction of the DMN and SVN ALE images and are reported as ALE scores (in purple). Overlaps in functional connectivity with VMPFC were found in dPCC, vPCC, striatum, amygdala, and MFG. The maximum ALE statistic outside the VMPFC seed in this conjunction was found in dPCC (ALE = 20.1 \u00d7 10 ). Coordinates and cluster information for the conjunction are listed in Table  . \n  \nLooking at the contrasts between the two ALE maps of connectivity with VMPFC, six clusters in grey matter passed the second threshold for showing distinct connectivity with VMPFC in the DMN. These clusters were located in the precuneus, bilateral MTG, RIPL, RSMG, and LMFG. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the RIPL (ALE = 354.0 \u00d7 10 ). For SVN, the only cluster indicating distinct functional connectivity with VMPFC was found in the striatum (ALE = 389.1 \u00d7 10 ). See Figure  . \n\nWe then looked at co-activations with dPCC in both networks. In DMN, clusters of activity in the VMPFC, pC, dACC, LMFG, RIPL, and bilateral MTG were found to co-activate with dPCC. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC was in RMTG (ALE = 31.1 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . In the SV data, we found clusters of co-activations with dPCC in the striatum, VMPFC, dACC, right inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, and midbrain. The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC was in the striatum (ALE = 50.0 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . Looking at the conjunction of these two co-activation maps, we found clusters in the VMPFC and dACC indicating overlap in functional connectivity between dPCC, dACC, and VMPFC across the two networks. The maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC in this conjunction was found in dACC (ALE = 20.4 \u00d7 10 ). The results are presented in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Maxima and cluster information for the conjunction of MACM results for SVN and DMN looking at functional connectivity with PCC  . \n  \n The analysis identified five distinct clusters of overlap using ALE, four outside of the PCC seed.

For assessing connectivity patterns that were specific to DMN or SVN, we contrasted their ALE images, which are reported as z-scores (in blue for DMN-specific connectivity or red for SVN-specific connectivity). The overlaps in functional connectivity assessed by the conjunction of the DMN and SVN ALE images and are reported as ALE scores (in purple). Overlaps in functional connectivity with PCC were found in VMPFC and dACC. The maximum ALE statistic outside the dPCC seed in this conjunction was found in the dACC (ALE = 20.4 \u00d7 10 ). Coordinates and cluster information for the conjunction are listed in Table  . \n  \nThe contrast between the PCC-connectivity ALE maps for the two networks revealed that DMN had distinct co-activations between PCC, pC, RIPL, and RMTG. See Figure  . The cluster containing the maximum ALE statistic was in the pC (ALE = 389.1 \u00d7 10 ). On the other hand, in the SVN, PCC was found to have distinct co-activations in the striatum and a small subregion of PCC (ALE = 389.1 \u00d7 10 ). See Figure  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nOur goal in this research was to investigate whether and where there may be regional overlaps and dissociations across the SVN and DMN and to assess whether these overlapping regions also show similar patterns of functional connectivity. We found considerable overlaps between SVN and DMN in cVMPFC and dPCC. Moreover, our findings show that similar patterns of functional connectivity between dPCC and cVMPFC are present in both networks. In SVN as well as DMN, activation in dPCC alone seems to elicit co-activation in a large and overlapping subregion of cVMPFC. On the other hand, activity in cVMPFC alone leads to a smaller set of subregions showing co-activation in the dPCC. Thus, there is some asymmetry in the bidirectional functional connectivity between cVMPFC and dPCC, such that a large portion of cVMPFC seems to be an important component of computations that involve dPCC in both DMN and SVN, while a relatively limited set of subregions in dPCC engage as consistently along with computations that involve cVMPFC across the two networks. \n\nThis pattern of regional overlap in these two crucial regions of interest is consistent with the more central (as opposed to anterior or ventral) subregion of VMPFC that Clithero and Rangel ( ) found to consistently co-activate with dPCC and VSTR. This suggests that of the two patterns of co-activation with central VMPFC that were previously identified in the SVN [the other being co-activations in vPCC and left angular gyrus (LAG)], the cVMPFC-dPCC co-activations seem to be present in DMN as well, while VMPFC-vPCC-LAG co-activations are not. This finding is also consistent with recent work dissociating the functions of dPCC and vPCC, demonstrating increasing connectivity within the DMN for dPCC and decreasing connectivity within the DMN for vPCC with increasing task difficulty (Leech et al.,  ). The overlaps we find in dPCC across SVN and DMN thus provide further evidence that dPCC may serve as an interface between the DMN and other networks that modulate externally directed behavior (Vincent et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Margulies et al.,  ; Leech et al.,  ; Utevsky et al.,  ). \n\nWhile reporting their results, Clithero and Rangel ( ) point out the similarity of SVN with subnetworks found within the DMN, and speculate that value computations that require higher levels of episodic memory and mental simulations may be likely to recruit regions associated with DMN, such as dPCC. The results here suggest that there might be some validity to this hypothesis, especially given Clithero and Rangel ( )'s finding that activation in PCC is more strongly correlated with decision values than outcome values. This finding is informative, because if there is a demand for mental simulations in the process of value-based decision making, it must be more prominent during the decision stage, when outcomes are still uncertain and a state of the world resulting from a decision has not yet been realized. Further in support of this idea, Bartra et al. ( ) find strong clustering of activity in PCC for monetary, but not primary outcomes. In fact, PCC has received relatively little attention in the neuroeconomics literature with respect to SV. The results of the meta-analysis here suggest that SV-related activations in the dPCC overlap with those related to the DMN. dPCC may be involved in integrating mental simulations generated by the DMN aimed at assessing more abstract potential outcomes during the valuation process. In many decision contexts (decision-making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, anticipations of reciprocated social rewards in altruistic behavior) the potential outcomes are uncertain or intangible and thus might require internally focused and complex simulations of future states of the world for their valuation. \n\nAn alternative point of view could be raised based on findings relating PCC activation to task engagement, change detection, and monitoring of choice-irrelevant value. Pearson et al. ( ) propose a unifying perspective reconciling numerous mental activities that PCC has been associated with, including guiding memory and movement (Vogt et al.,  ), reward outcome monitoring (McCoy et al.,  ), goal-directed cognition (Spreng et al.,  ), action evaluation and behavioral modification (Hayden et al.,  ), and late stages of reinforcement learning (Bussey et al.,  ). This pattern of functional claims is consistent with PCC being engaged in change detection, suggesting that this might be a core function of the DMN (Pearson et al.,  ). In a similar vein, Grueschow et al. ( ) show that PCC tracks choice-independent value while VMPFC tracks choice-dependent value, and further show that the strength of PCC activation predicts attentional capture by choice-irrelevant stimuli. These findings suggest that the PCC (and its default-mode associated functions) might play an important role in value-based decision making, especially in terms of behavioral control and the evaluation of affordances (Pearson et al.,  ; Grueschow et al.,  ). Our finding of a shared cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork between DMN and SVN can not differentiate between these two accounts. However, there may not be such a need, as these two accounts of the role PCC might play in the SVN (assessing abstract outcomes or assessing alternative courses of actions) and preexisting explanations for the role of PCC in the DMN have a common denominator, which is the integration of mental simulations into other cognitive processes. In these terms, this idea is also consistent with Leech et al. ( ), where the authors provide evidence for dPCC's role as a cortical hub integrating information from different functional networks in the brain. In fact, Buckner et al. ( ) propose that within the DMN, the MTL provides information from previous associations and memories, which serve as the building blocks of mental simulation, while MPFC to facilitates the use of these building blocks in the construction of self-referential mental simulations. According to this perspective, these subsystems converge in the PCC, where information is integrated. \n\nIt is also important to consider the anatomical overlaps in VMPFC activation foci across DMN and SVN, and whether they may point toward overlaps in the function of VMPFC across these networks. In addition to being a component of both SVN and DMN, VMPFC has been shown to play a role in affect regulation by interpreting affective information and altering responses based on contextual demands (Schiller and Delgado,  ; Giustino and Maren,  ). VMPFC has also been associated with social cognition, and is theorized to play a role in social judgments by simulating mental states that evaluate one's own and others' behaviors (Hughes and Beer,  ; Flagan and Beer,  ; Schurz et al.,  ). It is appealing to unify these functions into a more basic and fundamental role. Interestingly, there are overlaps in DMN and the roles that are attributed to VMPFC within these distinct perspectives. As we discussed before, the tracking of internal states and the integration of memory and prospection for simulating abstract rewards are important from the SV perspective. The affective regulation perspective has provided evidence that VMPFC may modulate the interpretation and responses to affective stimuli by redefining their meaning through the integration of value and contextual information (Delgado et al.,  ). This perspective is associated with self-referential cognition and also presents a potential need for the integration of information from processes responsible for memory, prospection, and planning that are associated with the DMN. Finally, the social cognition perspective argues for VMPFC involvement in the simulation of mental states for evaluating self- and other-generated social behavior, which follows the same theme. For these reasons, in line with Buckner et al. ( ), the cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork we have found to be overlapping across DMN and SVN may warrant characterization as potentially being responsible for generating information based on mental simulations in cVMPFC and integrating them in dPCC into various more specialized processes that guide internally- or externally-directed behavior, such as economic or social decision-making. Although the overlaps between social cognition and DMN lie beyond the scope of this paper, future research could assess similarities and differences between DMN, valuation, and social cognition. \n\nIt is worthwhile acknowledging the local parcellation of activity in VMPFC for different cognitive functions. For example, Clithero and Rangel ( ) present some evidence for a posterior-to-anterior activation gradient in VMPFC as one moves from concrete to abstract reward modalities, in line with Grabenhorst and Rolls ( ). On the other hand, the results of Bartra et al. ( ) suggest a unified neural system that represents SV across different outcome modalities. Given the ostensible similarities in their datasets, these divergent results may be driven by small differences their exclusion criteria (exclusive focus on studies that report parametric effects of SV or including those reporting only high vs. low value) or their utilization of slightly different meta-analytic tools (Activation Likelihood Estimate and Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis). Yet, both analyses also find a cluster in more anterior VMPFC that co-activates with vPCC, which we find to be specialized for SVN. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to classify the entirety of VMPFC as simply and only a subcomponent of DMN. In a similar vein, the SV, social cognition, and affective regulation related functions of VMPFC can be partially dissociated into distinct subregions within the VMPFC (Zhang et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ). \n\nIt is worth thinking about this pattern of overlap from the DMN perspective as well, especially given some overlap we also found in the striatum across the two networks. Past work has shown that SV signals can be found in the brain even when consumer products are placed outside the focus of attention (Tusche et al.,  ), in contexts where SV of products are irrelevant to the choice at hand (Grueschow et al.,  ), or when there is no choice involved at all (Smith et al.,  ; Lebreton et al.,  ). The involvement of a common cVMPFC-dPCC circuit in DMN and SVN could alternatively be indicative of an inherent and automatic tendency of the brain to track value representations. Keeping track of SV in simulations of the past and the future might be important in learning from the past and better preparing for the future. \n\nOur analyses also suggested that activity in LMTG, RMTG, and pC is significantly more correlated with DMN, while activity in the aVMPFC and striatum is significantly more correlated with SVN. In fact, this aVMPFC cluster is almost identical to the latter VMPFC subnetwork identified by Clithero and Rangel ( ) that co-activated with the left angular gyrus and vPCC instead of with dPCC. Activity in this anterior part of the VMPFC, in our analyses as well as in Bartra et al. ( ) and Clithero and Rangel ( ) is most closely related with the processing of monetary rewards, and shows little activity during both decisions and outcomes with primary rewards. This suggests that there might be functional specialization in aVMPFC for valuation. Bartra et al. ( ) suggest that aVMPFC could be involved in the mapping the value of abstract outcomes, such as monetary and social rewards (which, based on our results, may be relayed by the dPCC-cVMPFC subnetwork) to the same common currency space for comparisons across outcome modalities. Furthermore, we found parcellation within the PCC with a large proportion of it corresponding to DMN function, consistent with the heterogeneity previously found in this region (Leech et al.,  ,  ; Utevsky et al.,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis provides direct quantitative evidence demonstrating regional overlaps between the SVN and DMN in the brain. In addition, our findings point toward a shared functional cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork. The possibility of this shared subnetwork serving the same function across the two networks raises a wide range of thought-provoking questions about what the common functional denominator of DMN and SVN might be. Our results, based on our understanding of the literature, suggests that the cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork may be present in various cognitive processes that require the generation and integration of mental simulations, involving autobiographical memory, prospection, and self-referential thought. Future research could investigate the specific role of self-referential processes and mental simulations of the past and the future in the assessment and representation of abstract rewards. A specific question of interest is how different subregions of PCC may change their patterns of connectivity with the rest of the brain as rewards become more and more abstract during value-based decision making. Based on our results, we would speculate that one would observe increased connectivity of dPCC with the rest of the SVN as rewards become more abstract. Furthermore, future research could look at whether automatic SV representations play a role in spontaneous mind wandering at rest. Finally, it is an open question whether this cVMPFC-dPCC subnetwork may be active in other cognitive processes, potentially integrating information from mental simulations for more optimal behavior. Such cognitive processes could include social behaviors, such as cooperation (Fehr and Fischbacher,  ) and moral judgment (Greene and Haidt,  ) or planning for goals (Van der Linden et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nMYA acquired and assembled input data, conducted analyses, generated reports, and prepared the manuscript.

Two investigators independently performed literature selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The methodological quality was assessed with a modified version of the checklist.

Regarding the immediate effect of acupuncture on migraine, the ALE meta-analysis demonstrated that the deactivation regions were mainly located in the superior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus (uncorrected   P   < 0.001). The ALE meta-analysis of the cumulative effect showed that the activation regions were the thalamus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, insula, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and the deactivation brain regions were located in the transverse temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior occipital gyrus (uncorrected   P   < 0.001). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture could activate multiple brain areas related with the regulation of pain conduction, processing, emotion, cognition, and other brain regions in patients with migraine. In the future, the combination of multiple imaging technologies could be a new approach to deeply investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMigraine is a chronic paroxysmal neurological disorder, along with multiphase attacks of headache and a myriad of neurological symptoms ( ). According to epidemiological statistics ( ), the global age-standardized point prevalence and annual incidence rate of migraine were 14,107.3 and 1,142.5 per 100,000 in 2019, and migraine prevalence peaks in 40 to 44 age group. Migraine sufferers have a variety of problems that can lead to decreased productivity at school, at home, and in society. Globally, migraine is the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) accounting for 45.1 million YLDs annually ( ). The economic costs of migraine are substantial. The high prevalence and societal burden of migraine have contributed to the acknowledgment of migraine as a serious public health concern. At present, pharmaceutical treatment for migraine is the most basic and common treatment. However, the efficacy of most existing drugs for migraine is limited, and long-term use may produce significant side effects, such as addiction, and overdose deaths ( ). For the management of migraine, safe, effective, and acceptable non-pharmacological treatments are crucial to solve this problem. \n\nMounting evidence supports the application of acupuncture to prevent and treat migraines, due to its long-term effectiveness, good tolerance, and fewer side effects. A Cochrane review from Germany concluded that acupuncture was effective and safe for episodic migraine prophylaxis when compared with prophylactic drug treatment ( ). Apart from reducing pain, acupuncture may be beneficial for migraineurs with co-morbid problems such as anxiety, insomnia, and muscle tension ( ;  ). Acupuncture imaging studies have confirmed that the anti-migraine mechanism of acupuncture is closely related to the regulation of cerebral activities, which can modulate the functional and structural brain in patients with migraine ( ).   found that acupuncture could normalize the decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the rostral ventromedial medulla\/trigeminocervical complex in migraineurs.   observed that the region homogeneity (ReHo) values in the cerebellum and angular gyrus increased significantly after 12 sessions of acupuncture treatment in patients with migraine.   discovered that acupuncture could increase the functional connectivity (FC) of brain regions in patients with migraine. Nevertheless, the underlying central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine is still not completely studied. \n\nThe resting-state fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is used to measure the spontaneous activity of neurons by enabling the recording of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. Three indicators are commonly used to determine spontaneous brain activity: ALFF, fractional ALFF (fALFF), and ReHo ( ;  ). ALFF and fALFF reflect the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal ( ;  ). ReHo indicates the synchronization and consistency of the BOLD signal between a single voxel and neighboring voxels ( ). Therefore, the combination of ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo can fully present spontaneous activity of the local brain. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is an effective method for meta-analysis of brain neuroimaging, which is a brain region localization analysis method based on voxel coordinates, and the brain region localization can be achieved by carrying out 3D Gaussian smoothing and permutation tests of the relevant coordinates in the included studies. Previous reviews narratively summarized the functional brain changes of acupuncture in patients with migraine ( ;  ), while quantitative meta-analyses were not performed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the acupuncture-related brain regions in migraineurs with ALE algorithm. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nThe protocol of this ALE-meta analysis has already been registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY)  (registration number: INPLASY2022110026). The present study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement ( ). \n\n### 2.1. Literature search \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive search in the following databases from their inception to August 18, 2022: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and the China Biology Medicine (CBM). Both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text words related to acupuncture, migraine, and fMRI were used to retrieve relevant studies. We additionally searched the references of the included studies. We consulted the specialists for possible eligible studies. The full search strategies for all databases are shown in  . \n\n\n### 2.2. Inclusion criteria \n  \nWe included studies that met the following criteria: \n  \nThe patients were diagnosed with migraine by any internationally recognized or accepted clinical guideline or consensus like The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version) ( ); \n  \nThe intervention involved electro-acupuncture or manual acupuncture; no limitations on manipulation methods of acupuncture, acupoint selection, and duration of acupuncture; \n  \nThe studies reported neuroimaging results (ReHo, ALFF, or fALFF) of pre- and post-acupuncture treatment   via   fMRI using the standard anatomical template; \n  \nBoth randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials were included. \n  \n\n### 2.3. Exclusion criteria \n  \nWe excluded studies that fulfilled the following criteria: \n  \nNo detailed description of the diagnostic criteria; \n  \nFull texts were unavailable through extensive search; \n  \nCoordinates could not be obtained through various approaches; \n  \nThe results were based on the region of interest. \n  \n\n### 2.4. Study selection \n  \nThe retrieved records were imported into Endnote (X9). After removing duplicates, two researchers (X-BL and X-YG) independently eliminated irrelevant records by reading the titles and abstracts, then screened the rest records in full text to identify eligible studies. After selection, two reviewers cross-checked, and disagreements were settled through team discussion or consultation with the third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.5. Data extraction \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) extracted the following information: (1) publication information: title, first author, year of publication; (2) demographic characteristics: types of migraine, diagnostic criteria, sample size, characteristics of the study population (age, gender); (3) intervention details: manipulation methods of acupuncture, frequency, duration, and sessions; (4) neuroimaging data: MRI acquisition, processing parameters, analysis parameters, activation coordinates (POST > PRE), and deactivation coordinates (PRE > POST), along with their associated standard anatomical template. If a study observed the neuroimaging results of different acupoints or needle stimulations, we extracted data separately. After extraction, two reviewers cross-checked to ensure accuracy. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.6. Assessment of methodological quality \n  \nA modified version of checklist ( ;  ) was used to assess the methodological quality of individual functional neuroimaging studies. The checklist contains two domains (Category 1: Sample characteristics, Category 2: Methodology and reporting) with 13 items. The overall score is 20 points. The higher the score, the better the methodological quality. Before the formal evaluation, two reviewers intensively discussed the checklist to achieve consensus. Then two independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) assessed and cross-checked the results. Discrepancies were resolved by team discussion. \n\n\n### 2.7. Evaluation of reporting quality of interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture \n  \nThe Revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) was used to appraise the reporting quality of interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture ( ). The STRICTA consists of six items (17 sub-items), including acupuncture rationale, details of needling, treatment regimen, co-interventions, practitioner background, and control or comparator interventions. Then the two independent reviewers (X-BL and X-YG) assessed and cross-checked the results. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (JL). \n\n\n### 2.8. Statistical analysis \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed with the Ginger ALE software (version 2.3.6) . The data analysis process was as follows: (1) Data organization: 3D (X, Y, Z) coordinates in the standard space included were organized into text files. (2) Convert coordinate format: Talairach space coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space coordinates using Ginger ALE software. (3) Parameter settings: uncorrected   P   < 0.001, and Min.Volume 150 mm  ( ). (4) Viewing results: the results were presented in an Excel spreadsheet, and the ALE maps were overlaid onto the MNI template and viewed with MRIcron . The process of data analysis is presented in  . \n  \nThe process of ALE analysis. \n  \n\n### 2.9. Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe reproducibility of the ALE meta-analysis results was assessed using the Jackknife sensitivity analysis method. That is, all studies were excluded one by one, and the remaining studies were re-analyzed. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Search selection \n  \nThe flow diagram of study selection is shown in  . A total of 338 records were retrieved in the literature search. Following the removal of 112 duplicates, 212 irrelevant records were eliminated based on their titles and abstracts, and 20 records were excluded based on full-text screening. Finally, we identified 14 eligible studies. The list of excluded records with reasons is provided in  . \n  \nFlow diagram of literature search. \n  \n\n### 3.2. Study overview \n  \nWe identified 14 eligible studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) for this ALE meta-analysis, of which 9 were in Chinese and 5 in English. There were 9 randomized controlled trials and 5 non-randomized controlled trials. With regards to the subtypes of migraine patients, 4 studies included patients with menstrual migraine, 4 studies enrolled migraine patients without aura, and 6 studies did not describe the subtypes of migraine. As for the analytical method, 3 studies used both the ALFF and ReHo, 8 studies adopted the ReHo, and 3 studies applied the ALFF. The details of all the included studies are presented in  . \n  \nCharacteristics of included studies. \n    \nThe needle stimulations were manual acupuncture (13 studies) and electro-acupuncture (1 study). There were 11 studies focused on the long-term efficacy of acupuncture for migraine and 5 studies on the immediate efficacy of acupuncture for migraine. Four studies included acupuncture with different acupoint protocols. The details of acupuncture treatment are shown in  . \n  \nIntervention details of included studies. \n    \nNeuroimaging data was acquired at either 1.5 T (1 study) or 3 T (12 studies), while one study did not specify the magnetic field strength. Most of the studies used the Siemens MRI scanner (8 studies), others included General Electric (4 studies), United Imaging Medical Systems (1 study), and 1 study did not report the scanner. Most of the structural images were obtained using fast spoiled gradient sequence (9 studies), magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) (2 studies), and 3 studies did not specify the T1. T2-functional images were mainly from the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (12 studies). Statistical analysis was conducted in either statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (13 studies) or data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF) (1 study). The details of MRI acquisition and analysis are demonstrated in  . \n  \nThe details of MRI acquisition and analysis. \n    \n\n### 3.3. Assessment of methodological quality \n  \nThe methodological quality of included studies ranges from 16 to 19 points. In Category 1 (Sample characteristics), the patients from all included studies were evaluated with specific standardized diagnostic criteria (item 1), and all the important demographic data (item 2) were reported. While only 6 studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) recruited healthy comparison subjects and provided demographic data (item 3), only 1 study ( ) reported important clinical variables (item 4), and the sample size per group of 11 studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) were > 10 (item 5). In Category 2 (Methodology and reporting), all the items were adequately reported. The detailed information of the methodological quality of included studies are shown in  . The modified version of checklist is provided in  . \n\n\n### 3.4. STRICTA checklist for the included studies \n  \nAccording to the STRICTA checklist, the items with 70% of reporting rates were item 1a (style of acupuncture, 100%), item 1b (reasoning for treatment provided, 88.2%), item 2b (points used, 100%), item 2c (depths of insertion, 100%), item 2d (response sought, 76.5%), item 2e (needle stimulation, 100%), item 2f (needle retention time, 100%), item 2g (needle type, 94.1%), item 3a (number of treatment sessions, 100%), and item 3b (frequency and duration of treatment sessions, 100%). While, item 1c (the extent to which treatment was varied), item 2a (number of needle insertions per subject per session), and item 4a (details of other interventions) were not mentioned in the included studies. The STRICTA checklist is shown in  . \n\n\n### 3.5. ALE meta-analysis results \n  \n#### 3.5.1. The immediate effect of acupuncture \n  \nFive studies evaluated the immediate effects of acupuncture on migraine ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We extracted 82 foci with brain activation regions from 6 experiments, and 61 foci with brain deactivation regions from 5 experiments in patients with migraine after acupuncture treatment. No significant clusters with activation brain were detected between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment. One significant cluster with deactivation brain was found between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG, 168 mm , BA9). The specific analysis results are presented in   and  . \n  \nChanges of brain activation in patients with pre- to post- acupuncture. \n      \nRegions of brain activation in patients with pre- to post- acupuncture (immediate effect).

The cumulative effect of acupuncture \n  \nThe data from 11 studies were pooled to investigate the cumulative effect of acupuncture on migraine ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We extracted the 77 foci with brain activation regions from 13 experiments and 83 foci with brain deactivation regions from 12 experiments in patients with migraine after acupuncture treatment. Seven activated clusters were found between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: (1) the right thalamus (THA, 976 mm ); (2) the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG, 400 mm , BA8); (3) the left posterior lobe (376 mm ); (4) the right insula (INS, 344 mm , BA13); (5) the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, 272 mm , BA8); (6) the right precentral gyrus (PreCG, 224 mm , BA6); (7) the left anterior cingulate (ACC, 208 mm , BA24). Five deactivated clusters were detected between pre-acupuncture and post-acupuncture treatment: (1) the right transverse temporal gyrus (TTG, 744 mm , BA41); (2) the left anterior cingulate (ACC, 328 mm , BA32); (3) the left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG, 192 mm ); (4) the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL, 192 mm , BA40); (5) the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG, 160 mm , BA19).

Sensitivity analysis \n  \nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis on the immediate effect and cumulative effect of acupuncture, and the details are shown in  . Leave-one-out analysis of the immediate effect (post-acupuncture < pre-acupuncture) showed that the repeatability of the left SFG was up to 3\/5 times of analysis, and MFG was up to 4\/5 times of analysis. Leave-one-out analysis of the cumulative effect (post-acupuncture > pre-acupuncture) revealed that right THA, MFG was up to 12\/13 times of analysis; right SFG, INS, PreCG, and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum, ACC was up to 11\/13 times of analysis. Leave-one-out analysis of the cumulative effect (post-acupuncture < pre-acupuncture) showed that the repeatability of the right TTG, Postcentral gyrus (PoCG), Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG), and left ACC, PHG, IPL, IOG was up to 10\/12 times of analysis. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we used the ALE method to perform a quantitative integration analysis of previously published original research and to identify the cerebral responses to acupuncture for migraine. The ALE analysis results of immediate acupuncture treatment showed that the deactivation regions located in the SFG and MFG. The ALE analysis results of cumulative acupuncture treatment revealed that the activation regions were the THA, SFG, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, INS, MFG, PreCG, ACC and the deactivation brain regions were the TTG, PoCG, STG, ACC, PHG, IPL, and IOG. The consistent results of immediate and cumulative change were the THA, INS, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, limbic system, and cerebellum. Pain is a multidimensional subjective experience generally including sensory (intensity, location), affective (unpleasantness, fear), and cognitive factors (memory, attention) ( ). The brain processing network of pain can be divided into the medial and lateral pain systems, which are respectively involved in processing the affective-cognitive-evaluative aspects of pain, and the sensory-discriminative aspects ( ). Based on our findings, we found that several regions of the lateral and medial pain systems (including the THA, INS, ACC, SFG, MFG, and PoCG) participated in the cerebral responses to acupuncture for migraine. \n\nThe medial and ventrobasal parts of THA are separately involved in the medial and lateral pain pathways. In migraine pathogenesis, THA is considered as the relay center of ascending nociceptive information ( ).   observed that the regional fALFF values of the bilateral ventral posteromedial thalamus was positively correlated with the duration of migraine.   discovered N-acetylaspartate\/creatine increased in bilateral THA of migraineurs after acupuncture, which was significantly related with the headache intensity. The anterior part of the INS encodes the emotional processing of pain, and the posterior part encodes the intensity and lateralization of pain. Thus, the INS plays an integrative role in nociceptive processing.   found that the duration of migraine was negatively associated with gray matter (GM) alterations in the left INS.   revealed that the INS was activated to integrate sensory and affective information and to produce analgesic effects during acupuncture stimulation. Our ALE meta-analysis showed that the activity of ACC (BA24) increased, while the activity of ACC (BA32) decreased after acupuncture in migraineurs. The ACC is considered to be involved in the affective-motivational component of pain ( ).   discovered that the dynamic ALFF values in the ACC were negatively correlated with pain intensity in migraine. The ACC plays a different role in pain processing.   found that the increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in area 24\u2019 of ACC may be involved in nocifensive reflex inhibition, and the reduced rCBF in area 32 of ACC may enhance pain perception in the surrounding cortex.   also discovered that the caudal part of the ACC (BA24) signal increased during the electrical acupoint stimulation, which positively related with the analgesic effect. Therefore, different parts of ACC may play different roles in the acupuncture-induced analgesic effect. The SFG is located at the superior part of the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for emotion regulation ( ). And the MFG is crucial to attention ( ). The increased GM in the right SFG and the decreased GM in the left MFG were observed in migraineurs ( ).   demonstrated that the decreased FC between the SFG and precuneus could restore to the healthy control level after acupuncture treatments.   found that the FC between the MFG and the dorsal ACC reduced in migraineurs, and the decreased connectivity in the MFG was negatively related to the pain intensity of migraine attacks. The PoCG located in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), which is involved in the adjustment of pain perception, including the positioning and recognition of pain intensity ( ).   discovered that increased brain activity of the right PoCG is positively correlated with headache frequency in patients with migraine.   also found that cerebral glucose metabolism decreased in the PoCG after acupuncture in migraine. \n\nBesides, the TTG, STG, IPL, HPG, IOG, PreCG, and posterior lobe of the cerebellum are also involved in the analgesic effect of acupuncture. The temporal lobe is recognized as a region associated with multisensory integration. An analysis of voxel-based morphometric studies of migraine ( ) showed that GM increased in the bilateral temporal poles, the bilateral STG, the right SFG, and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in migraine patients, and the frequency of migraine attacks was negatively associated with GM alteration in the left STG. This suggests that the temporal lobe is involved in pain regulation.   revealed that the STG and MTG may be the key nodes linked to the multisensory processing of pain modulation in patients with migraine during acupuncture. It has been confirmed that the cerebellum plays an important role in pain processing and regulation ( ).   observed that patients with migraine had significantly higher ALFF levels in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum in contrast with healthy controls.   revealed that the duration of migraine was negatively associated with GM alterations in the bilateral cerebellum (hemispheric lobule IX).   also found that GM increased in the PHG, and GM decreased in the IPL.   discovered that reduced FC between the right IPL and right MFG, and the FC Z-scores between the ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) and right IPL were negatively related with pain intensity and disease duration in migraine. The PHG is involved in pain perception, pain modulation, and descending pain facilitation ( ).   found that acupuncture could reduce brain glucose metabolism of PHG in migraine.   observed that compared with healthy subjects, the PreCG exhibited abnormal centrality in both structural and FC networks in migraineurs, and negative correlations were observed between migraine duration and PreCG. Our results indicated that IOG also participated in acupuncture-induced analgesia, while few studies supported the finding. \n\nThere were 5 studies focused on the immediate effect of acupuncture and 11 studies on the cumulative effect. The results of ALE meta-analysis showed that both SFG and MFG were associated with immediate and cumulative effects, but the activity of SFG and MFG decreased after immediate acupuncture and increased after cumulative acupuncture. A possible explanation for the inconsistent results may be related to the number of included studies, which needs further investigation. Simultaneously, the neuroimaging results indicated that cumulative acupuncture treatment could induce a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response in contrast with single acupuncture treatment. \n\n\n## 5. Strengths and limitations \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, there are several strengths. First, instead of descriptive analysis, we used the ALE methodology to analyze the brain changes of acupuncture intervention in patients with migraine. Second, the present study analyzed the imaging studies on the immediate and cumulative effects of acupuncture in patients with migraine. Third, we comprehensively evaluated the methodological quality and the reporting quality of interventions with a modified version of checklist and STRICTA. Nevertheless, there are several limitations. First, due to the limitations of the analytical method, funnel plot was unavailable to detect the publication bias of the included studies. Second, we failed to compare the brain changes of patients with migraine after acupuncture with those in healthy individuals due to the incomplete information among included studies. Third, the STRICTA results showed that the protocol of acupuncture was not reported adequately, researchers should report in accordance with STRICTA to improve the reporting quality. \n\n\n## 6. Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture could activate multiple brain areas related with the regulation of pain conduction, processing, emotion, cognition, and other brain regions in patients with migraine. In the future, the combination of multiple imaging technologies might be a new approach to deeply investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture for migraine. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJZ designed the protocol, conducted this review, and drafted the manuscript.

These findings have been interpreted as evidence for recruitment of controlled processes, at the expense of automatic processes when responding to emotional stimuli. However, activation of semantic areas has also been reported. The aim of the present work was to address the issue of the importance of semantic areas in emotion regulation by comparing recruitment of executive and semantic neural substrates in studies investigating different reappraisal strategies. With this aim, we reviewed neuroimaging studies on reappraisal and we classified them in two main categories: reappraisal of stimuli (RS) and reappraisal via perspective taking (RPT). We applied a coordinate-based meta-analysis to summarize the results of fMRI studies on different reappraisal strategies. Our results showed that reappraisal, when considered regardless of the specific instruction used in the studies, involved both executive and semantic areas of the brain. When considering different reappraisal strategies separately, in contrast, we found areas associated with executive function to be prominently recruited by RS, even if also semantic areas were activated. Instead, in RPT the most important clusters of brain activity were found in parietal and temporal semantic areas, without significant clusters in executive areas. These results indicate that modulation of activity in semantic areas may constitute an important aspect of emotion regulation in reappraisal, suggesting that semantic processes may be more important to understand the mechanism of emotion regulation than previously thought. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotion regulation plays a key role for the capacity, unique to humans, to react in a flexible way to emotional events ( , pp. 201\u2013216;  , pp. S47\u2013S53). Indeed, the capacity to adaptively regulate negative emotion seems to be a protective factor against the development and maintenance of psychopathology ( , pp. 974\u2013983;  , pp. 217\u2013237;  , pp. 128\u2013134). Moreover, the improvement of adaptive emotion regulation skills is one of the most important aims in several psychotherapeutic treatment approaches ( , pp. 611\u2013630;  , pp. 1230\u20131237) and interventions in health psychology ( , pp. 215\u2013221;  , pp. 205\u2013210). Especially in neuroscience, the concept of emotion regulation is key to explaining brain functioning alterations associated to psychopathology ( , pp. 413\u2013418) and their normalization due to psychotherapy ( , pp. 788\u2013796;  , p. e74657). \n\nIndividuals may use different emotion regulation skills to change the spontaneous flow of emotional reactions. For example, following stressful events individuals may attempt to positively reappraise the event ( , pp. 345\u2013360), use humor ( , pp. 1895\u20131909), avoid thoughts associated to such events by suppressing them ( , pp. 59\u201391), or may ruminate on the stressful event ( , p. 163). Differences between emotion regulation strategies are therefore of great interest in the context of models of mental health and psychological intervention. \n\nAmong emotion regulation strategies, reappraisal has been defined as \u201c  construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in non-emotional terms  \u201d ( , pp. 281\u2013291). The importance of reappraisal is due to its adaptive value in decreasing emotional experiences in response to negative events. For example, the habitual use of reappraisal has been found to be associated with the increased expression of positive emotion, more effective interpersonal functioning and increased well-being ( , pp. 281\u2013291;  , pp. 348\u2013362). In developmental psychology, evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that the habitual use of reappraisal predicts the development of interpersonal flexibility, interpersonal openness and stronger social connections in children and adolescents ( , pp. 780\u2013784;  , pp. 779\u2013786). In clinical psychology, it has been shown that reappraisal is positively correlated with mental health and negatively with emotional disorders ( , pp. 974\u2013983;  , pp. 341\u2013362). \n\nSeveral recent studies have used neuroimaging to clarify the neural mechanisms mediating reappraisal. In most of these studies, participants were exposed to negative emotional stimuli and were instructed to use emotion regulation strategies to regulate their emotional response to them ( , pp. 1215\u20131229). Using this methodology, neural correlates of emotion regulation have been identified as increases of activation in several prefrontal areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) ( , pp. 153\u2013158;  , pp. 2981\u20132990). Accompanying these increases, the decrease of amygdala activation has been reported as a correlate of successful regulation of negative emotions ( , pp. 275\u2013285). The involvement of prefrontal areas has been consistently reported in tasks that recruit executive attention and working memory, the control mechanisms that supervise the activation of various cognitive sub-processes through voluntary attention ( , pp. 637\u2013671;  , pp. 255\u2013274;  , pp. 46\u201359). Building on these well-established models of executive function, neurobiological models of reappraisal have focused on the concept of cognitive control to characterize the key process involved in reappraisal when responding to emotional stimuli ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. 797\u2013814). In this form of reappraisal, voluntary attention is directed to modulate responses to perceived emotional stimuli, instead of letting automatic reactions alone determine behavioral, physiological and experiential responses. \n\nOne outstanding question concerns the involvement of semantic areas in emotion regulation. Semantic processes include attributes of cognitive representations that are based on the generalization of experiences in the interaction with the environment and are subsequently used to give meaning to the new experience ( , p. 4). In emotion regulation studies, temporal, inferior parietal and ventromedial prefrontal areas have been reported as activated during reappraisal tasks ( , pp. 2981\u20132990). These areas are considered part of the semantic system ( , pp. 976\u2013987;  , pp. 2767\u20132796), which is the neural substrate of mental functions that allow the formation and recovery of conceptual knowledge, including representations of elements that are relevant in the context of emotion regulation such as generalization of emotional experiences ( , p. 223) and relationships that govern social interactions ( , pp. 1628\u20131635;  , pp. 6430\u20136435). \n\nThe present study extends previous meta-analyses of reappraisal studies ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355) by addressing the issue of the involvement of executive and semantic systems in emotion regulation of negative stimuli and by comparing recruitment of executive and semantic neural substrates in studies investigating different reappraisal strategies. We separately considered two different strategies of reappraisal [reappraisal of stimuli (RS) and reappraisal via perspective-taking] and performed a contrast analysis to examine the existence of significant statistical differences between the two sets of studies. The importance of this analysis stems from the consequent refinement of current neurobiological models of reappraisal, which focus on the concept of cognitive control. In contrast, the present study suggests that brain systems associated with cognitive control are not central in all forms of reappraisal, and at least another neural network \u2013 the semantic system \u2013 should be considered in emotion regulation. With this aim, we analyzed separately studies of different reappraisal strategies and we performed a contrast analysis to statistically compare these different strategies. \n\nOur attempt to compare different emotion regulation strategies required addressing a taxonomic issue that had remained unresolved despite the increasing number of neuroimaging studies on emotion regulation. Neuroimaging studies on reappraisal provide similar instructions to investigate different strategies and different instructions to investigate similar reappraisal strategies. For example, two studies that both aimed to evaluate the effect of reappraisal of emotional stimuli provided participants with quite different instructions.  , pp. 409\u2013423) asked participants to \u201c  decrease their emotional reactions by distancing themselves from the picture, by becoming a detached observer through thinking that the depicted situation is not real, only a picture  \u201d (p. 412), but specified that \u201c  subjects were told not to substitute negative emotions with positive emotion  \u201d (p. 412). In contrast,  , pp. 210\u2013219) asked participants to \u201c  transform the scenario depicted into positive terms (e.g., women crying outside of a church could be alternatively interpreted as expressing tears of joy from wedding ceremony rather than of sorrow from a funeral)  \u201d (p. 211). However, similar instructions have been used to evaluate different strategies of emotion regulation. For example, to investigate the strategy used in suppression,  , pp. 502\u2013510) have used a typical instruction used in reappraisal studies: \u201c  to suppress any emotional reaction to the sad stimuli. That is, they had to voluntarily decrease the intensity of the sad feelings felt in response to the sad film excerpts. To accomplish that goal, subjects were encouraged to distance themselves from those stimuli (i.e., to become a detached observer)  \u201d (p. 503). \n\nThe need for taxonomy of reappraisal strategies was addressed in a meta-analysis of behavioral studies on emotion regulation conducted by  , p. 775). In this work three different kind of reappraisal were described: (1) RS, in which, participants are instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of the stimulus; (2) reappraisal via perspective taking (RPT), in which participants are instructed to take another perspective (usually the perspective of a detached observer); (3) reappraisal of emotion, in which participants are instructed to interpret the emotion associated to experimental stimuli by accepting their emotional experience. Using this classification,   were able to detect differences between specific reappraisal strategies. For example, reappraising using perspective taking proved to be more effective than reappraising the emotional stimulus or the emotional response in influencing emotional experience and expression. However, with the exception of this study, the comparison between different reappraisal strategies has been neglected in both behavioral and neuroimaging investigations. \n\nIn the present work we used the classification proposed by  , p. 775) to systematically review neuroimaging studies on reappraisal and shed light on the specific aspects of different strategies of reappraisal by investigating possible differences in the associated neural substrates. We adopted a coordinate-based meta-analytic technique specifically developed for neuroimaging studies, the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method ( , pp. 155-164), to quantify the results of fMRI studies on different reappraisal strategies. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Studies Selection and Classification \n  \nNeuroimaging studies on reappraisal were collected through searches in PUBMED  and Google Scholar  using the keywords \u201cemotion regulation neuroimaging\u201d or \u201caffective regulation neuroimaging.\u201d Additional studies were obtained reviewing the references of papers founded on PUBMED database. \n\nWe included all the papers in accordance with the following criteria: (a) use of fMRI to investigate neural correlates of reappraisal; (b) use of general linear models to analyze contrasts between reappraisal conditions versus control condition and viceversa; (d) involvement of adult healthy participants; (e) activation foci reported in 3D coordinates (x, y, z) in stereotactic space. Despite the presence of studies that have focused their analyses on specific Regions of Interest (ROIs) and may therefore bias the detection of cerebral areas ( ), we included both whole brain and ROIs analyses because of the exiguous number of studies that have investigated the whole brain activity in reappraisal (see   Table   ). Exclusion criteria were: (a) studies investigating emotion regulation strategies different than reappraisal; (b) studies investigating reappraisal of positive emotional stimuli; (c) studies investigating reappraisal with the purpose of increasing emotional responses. Following these criteria a total of 21 studies and 437 participants were found (the main features of selected studies are shown in   Table   ). \n  \nMain features of studies included in the meta-analysis. \n    \nA careful coding of emotion regulation instructions that participants received in the neuroimaging studies was followed (see   Table    for original instructions of experimental and control tasks reported in single studies). Thus, according to the taxonomy proposed by  , pp. 775), we classified reappraisal strategies as: (1) Reappraisal of stimulus in which participants are instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of the stimulus, for example thinking that it is not real (RS;   N   = 8); (2) RPT in which participants are instructed to take the perspective of a detached observer; (RPT;   N   = 7); (3) Reappraisal of emotional response (  N   = 1), in which participants are instructed to interpret the emotion associated to experimental stimuli in a mindfulness manner ( , pp. 361\u2013366); (4) Reappraisal not-specified (  N   = 5), when instructions were generic or included more strategies. Instructions for control tasks were quite similar for all studies and they consisted in natural responses to experimental stimuli. \n\n\n### Meta-Analytic Procedure \n  \nSeveral meta-analyses were carried out based on the classification described in the previous section. Firstly, a preliminary meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the neural correlates of reappraisal regardless of the specific instructions. Secondly, on the basis of the classification of the instructions, we conducted two separate analyses to verify the existence of specific neural correlates of RPT and reappraisal of the stimulus. Because we found only one study investigating reappraisal of emotion ( , pp. 361\u2013366), we were not able to explore neural correlates of this strategy in a separate meta-analysis. \n\nTo conduct the meta-analyses, the ALE method for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data was used ( , pp. 2907\u20132926). This methods is based on the evaluation of the overlap between foci of activation found in different studies and treats the reported foci not as single points, but as centers for 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty ( , pp. 765\u2013780;  , pp. 1\u201313). To this aim, an algorithm is used to identify clusters of brain activity that show a convergence of activation across experiments and determine if the clusters thus obtained occur more frequently than in the null distribution arising from random spatial association between the results of different experiments. ALE meta-analysis was carried out using GingerALE 2.3 software distributed by the BrainMap project  ( , pp. 155\u2013164). We employed the \u201cnon-additive\u201d method, which models each focus with a Gaussian function defined by a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel size empirically determined by finding the maximum across each focus\u2019s Gaussian ( , pp. 1\u201313). The non-additive method allows the modeling of the spatial uncertainty of each focus arising from inter-subject and inter-study variability. The meta-analyses were performed in Talairach space. Coordinates reported in studies in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space were transformed into Talairach coordinates using the Lancaster transform, icbm2tal algorithm ( , pp. 677\u2013683) included in the Convert Foci tool of GingerALE. \n\nWe conducted several meta-analyses. In the first meta-analysis we included all reappraisal studies irrespective of the strategy. Foci of activation were collected from all the contrasts between reappraisal conditions versus control conditions and vice versa, as reported in the original studies. In the second meta-analysis we considered the contrasts between RS   versus   the control condition and vice versa. In the third meta-analysis we considered the contrasts between reappraisal via perspective-taking   versus   the control condition and vice versa. Finally, to test the interaction between condition (experimental condition   versus   control condition) and strategy (RS   versus   reappraisal via perspective-taking), a subtractive analysis was conducted comparing ALE values of specific reappraisal strategies (RS versus RPT;  , pp. 938\u2013949). In all cases statistical significance was determined through a permutation tests. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural Correlates of Reappraisal \n  \nThe first meta-analysis evaluated the main effect of reappraisal regardless of the specific reappraisal instruction used in the studies (see   Table   ,   Figure   ). This analysis was based on 21 studies and 437 participants, yielding a total of 245 foci for the contrast reappraisal condition versus control condition and 13 studies, 272 participants, yielding a total of 73 foci for the contrast control condition versus reappraisal condition. The probability maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.001 and corrected using false discovery rates (FDRs), the minimum clusters extent was of 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm \u00d7 200 mm. \n  \nSignificant clusters of brain activity in reappraisal studies. \n      \n Brain activity in reappraisal tasks.   In warm colors significant cluster of increased brain activity, in cold colors significant clusters of decrease brain activity. mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; iFG, inferior frontal gyrus; mTG, middle temporal gyrus; AG, angular gyrus; Amy, amygdala. \n  \nSignificant clusters of increased activation were found in the dorsal attentional system (dlPFC and the posterior medial prefrontal cortex, with extension to the anterior cingulated cortex). Several clusters of increased activation were located also in the semantic system, i.e., in the inferior prefrontal gyrus, superior\/middle temporal gyrus and in the angular gyrus on the left side. Finally, clusters of decreased activation were found in limbic areas such as the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus. \n\n\n### Neural Correlates of Specific Reappraisal Strategies \n  \nMeta-analyses on the effect of specific strategies were conducted considering RS and RPT separately. For both meta-analyses, probability maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 and corrected using FDRs. \n\nThe meta-analysis of studies on RS included eight studies and 163 participants, yielding a total of 105 foci for the contrast RS condition versus control condition and four studies, 73 subjects yielding a total of 18 foci for the contrast control condition versus RS. The results of this meta-analysis were quite similar to the results of the main meta-analysis, with significant clusters of increased brain activation in dorsal attentional system (in dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex) and in the sematic system (temporal gyrus and angular gyrus on the left, inferior prefrontal cortex; see   Table   ,   Figure    in violet), and significant clusters of decreased activation in areas involved in emotional reactivity (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally; see   Table   ,   Figure    in violet). \n  \nSignificant clusters of brain activity in RS and (A,B) and reappraisal via perspective-taking (RPT; C,D). \n      \n Brain activity in reappraisal of stimuli and reappraisal via perspective-taking.   In violet increased brain activity during RS; in green increased brain activity during reappraisal via perspective-taking. mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; dlPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; iFG, inferior frontal gyrus; mTG, middle temporal gyrus; AG, angular gyrus. \n  \nThe meta-analysis of RPT studies included seven studies and 151 participants, yielding a total of 77 foci for the contrast RPT condition versus control condition and 51 foci for the contrast control condition versus RPT. Here, the biggest clusters of increased activation were located in the right inferior parietal lobe\/angular gyrus on the right and in the superior temporal gyrus on the left (see   Table   ,   Figure    in green). No significant cluster of activation was found in the prefrontal cortex. Significant clusters of decreased activation were found in the amygdala bilaterally and thalamus (see   Table   ). \n\nFinally, a comparative analysis was conducted to quantify the differences between the RS and RPT reappraisal strategies. Also in this case, probability maps were threshold at   p   < 0.01 and corrected using FDRs. Due to the small number of studies, only a cluster survived to the direct comparison between strategies. This cluster was specific for RS strategies but not for RPT. It was located in the medial prefrontal cortex (localization of the cluster in 3D Talairach coordinates:   x   = -14,   y   = 11,   z   = 54; Broadmann\u2019s area = 6;   z  -score obtained in the subtractive analysis:   z   = 3.01,   p   < 0.01 corrected for FDR). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNeurobiological models of reappraisal emphasize the role of executive function in emotional control ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. E1\u2013E24), whereas the contribution of semantic processes has been less addressed in the literature. In the present study we systematically reviewed, classified and meta-analyzed neuroimaging studies on different reappraisal strategies of negative stimuli. Our attempt was to investigate the role of executive and semantic functions in emotion regulation. Namely, we verified the involvement of these functions in reappraisal regardless of the specific form of reappraisal investigated in single studies, and considering two specific reappraisal tasks on the basis of the instruction provided by authors to participants in each single study. \n\nThe classification of neuroimaging studies on reappraisal was carried out through careful coding of emotion regulation instructions that participants received in each neuroimaging study that corresponded to our selection criteria. We focused on two main categories of studies on reappraisal that resulted to be well-represented in the literature: RS and RPT. In studies on RS participants were instructed to reappraise the situation or the cause of experimental stimulus. In this case typical experimental paradigms were based on the exposure of participants to emotional negative pictures during the fMRI scanning, and they were asking to think that the picture was not real (for example, to think that the pictures showed was a movie or that the persons in the pictures were actors). In studies of reappraisal via perspective-taking participants were instructed to take the perspective of a detached observer during the exposure to negative emotional pictures. \n\nIn the main meta-analysis of reappraisal, which considered all studies regardless of the specific instruction adopted in the study, the neural substrates associated with recruitment of executive processes resulted activated by reappraisal. Significant clusters of increased activation were detected in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal\/anterior cingulated areas, which are part of the voluntary attentional system ( , pp. 475\u2013483;  , pp. 284\u2013291). Accompanying such activations, clusters of decreased activity were detected in subcortical areas associated to emotional reactivity such as the amygdala ( , pp. 331\u2013348;  , pp. 811\u2013830). As in previous meta-analyses ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355), the observed increased activation in areas of the voluntary attentional system is consistent with the neurobiological model of reappraisal, which views it as a controlled process involving executive functions and working memory ( , pp. 242\u2013249). Furthermore, the decreased activation of limbic areas may be interpreted as diminished arousal following regulation ( , pp. 303\u2013312;  , pp. 1037\u20131050). Together with these results regarding the voluntary attentional system, the meta-analyses also detected activations of areas that are considered part of the semantic system, such as the temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus ( , pp. 976\u2013987;  , pp. 2767\u20132796). Despite also these results have been observed in previous meta-analyses ( , pp. 275\u2013285;  , pp. 2981\u20132990;  , pp. 345\u2013355), the importance of their contribution to emotion regulation has been neglected in neurobiological models of reappraisal. \n\nIn the present study, the separate consideration of RS and RPT strategies allowed us to observe the different prominence of executive and semantic areas in the reappraisal strategies. We observed that areas of the voluntary attentional system were activated in RS strategy but not in RPT. Specifically, in the analysis in which these two strategies were directly compared a significant cluster of increased activation located in the dorsomedial\/anterior cingulated cortex differentiated activations in RS from RPT reappraisal. These results suggest that the RPT strategy may rely less on executive control than RS, suggesting that executive functions might be not as essential for emotion regulation as previously thought ( , pp. 153\u2013158;  , pp. E1\u2013E24). \n\nSeveral considerations support this conclusion. According to the models of reappraisal as a form of cognitive control ( , pp. 242\u2013249;  , pp. 788\u2013796), the involvement of voluntary attention in RS should be associated with increased effectiveness in emotion regulation. However, this association was not observed in the meta-analysis, where the different involvement of prefrontal areas in RS and RPT did not correspond to different outcomes in terms of limbic activation (both strategies were associated to similar decrease in amygdala activity). These results are not surprising in the light of behavioral data to the effect that both RS and RPT are similar in reducing emotional response to unpleasant stimuli ( , pp. 435\u2013444;  , p. 775). In one study RPT was even more effective in this regard, whereas RS was more likely to maintain subjective experience and facial expression associated to the emotion elicited by the experimental stimuli ( , p. 416). Due to the absence of evidence on differences in effectiveness of the reappraisal strategies considered in the present study, the variable involvement of executive functions in RS compared to RPT may simply reflect a difference in the amount of cognitive effort required by each strategy. Neuroimaging studies of working memory have reported progressive activation of areas of the voluntary attentional system in association with the cognitive demands required by the task ( , pp. 721\u2013731). Reappraisal may involve working memory when a cognitive effort is required, but this effort may be reduced when the strategies adopted to regulate are less demanding ( , pp. 730\u2013743). Furthermore, other studies report the existence of implicit forms of emotion regulation, in which emotion are regulated without voluntary attempts to control them ( , pp. 1\u201318;  , pp. 389\u2013399). The few existing neuroimaging studies on implicit forms of emotion regulation have shown that the areas of the voluntary attentional system are not recruited ( , p. e15454) and do not correlate with individual differences in spontaneous avoidance ( , p. 239). \n\nIn contrast to the inconstant recruitment of the voluntary attentional network, the activation of semantic areas emerged as a common aspect of emotion regulation despite of the specific strategy adopted by participants. How do semantic processes contribute to emotion regulation? The presence of specific semantic content may have a role in the effectiveness of reappraisal. It is conceivable that the existence of a wealth of semantic representations that one can activate in order to reappraise emotional stimuli facilitates the generation of alternative representations of what happened. Instead, a person with poor semantic representations of contingencies related to emotionally arousing situations may have more difficulties in using semantic information to reappraise emotional stimuli. For example, black\/white thinking in borderline patients may be related to their difficulties in generating mentalizing appraisals of other people\u2019s possible motives, a form of knowledge that is based on semantic memory for social interactions ( , pp. 1241\u20131253). Due to the evidence that semantic activation may play a role in emotion regulation regardless to the involvement of executive functions, our hypothesis is that semantic processes may involve different kind of attentional processes. In studies on spatial attention ( , pp. 201\u2013215;  , pp. 107\u2013123), a ventral attentional network has been described that is activated when attention is directed spontaneously to stimuli that are behaviourally relevant, regardless the voluntary attempt of participants to direct their attention to this stimuli and regardless to the salience of this stimuli, but is also recruited in studies in which top\u2013down control of emotional stimuli is required ( , pp. 306\u2013324). Such network includes the temporo-parietal junction observed in RS and RPT studies meta-analyzed in the present study. \n\nIn the context of emotion regulation, the ventral network may influence emotion regulation by conveying the influence of semantic networks due to the intervention of a proactive mechanism of control on the emotional representations ( ). Because emotion regulation strategies such as spontaneous avoidance ( , p. e15454;  , p. 239) or acceptance ( , p. 361\u2013366) also appear to recruit these areas, there is room in future studies for investigating forms of emotion regulation not based on cognitive control to enrich emotion regulation models and to clarify the adaptive value of emotion regulation strategies. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the majority of the studies which have investigated emotion regulation have used ROIs approach. The   a priori   definitions of ROIs may bias the detection of cerebral areas in emotion regulation literature, as the effects in ROIs that were defined   a priori   are likely to be overrated ( , pp. 275\u2013285). Secondly, many of the studies investigating reappraisal used quite generic instructions that did not allow us to classify the specific strategies under investigation. This limitation had the consequence to reduce the number of studies included in meta-analyses of specific strategies. Third, we cannot exclude that participants were using the strategy of distracting themselves from the experimental stimuli (despite the instruction provided by experimenters). For example, if self-distraction involved the generation of alternative verbal material, then it would be expected to be associated with the activation of semantic areas, which has been detected in words generation tasks ( , p. 153\u2013170). However, as we noted in Section \u201cDiscussion,\u201d the ready availability of appropriate alternative semantic content may be an important factor in the effectiveness of reappraisal also when following the strategy of \u201cthinking of something else.\u201d Hence, an important message of the present paper is that semantic activation may play a role in emotion regulation regardless of the involvement of executive functions. Future studies may define more carefully the specific reappraisal strategy under investigation. Because of the small number of studies included in meta-analyses of specific strategies, their results should be considered as explorative, but not conclusive. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBoth executive and semantic aspects of emotion regulation were found to be involved in functional imaging studies of emotional reappraisal, but with a different pattern according to the reappraisal strategy. In reappraisal of emotional stimuli, executive functions were found to be recruited in the meta-analysis, even if also semantic areas were activated. Instead, in RPT the most important clusters of brain activity were found on parietal and temporal semantic areas, similarly to less adaptive strategies such as suppression or avoidance. This heterogeneity suggests that executive functions are just one aspect of emotion regulation, and that their relevance may depend on the specific reappraisal strategy adopted by participants, including the depth of semantic encoding and the use of semantic networks. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4499672,"text_md5":"f633f42fab1e2906054f10d24cddc24f","field_positions":{"authors":[0,72],"journal":[73,86],"publication_year":[88,92],"title":[103,225],"keywords":[239,346],"abstract":[359,2048],"body":[2057,33247]},"batch":1,"pmid":26217277,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.00956","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4499672","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4499672"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4499672\">4499672<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4499672  Executive and semantic processes in reappraisal of negative stimuli: insights from a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies"}

The underlying neurological dysfunctions in both processes, which are interrelated and share neuroanatomical bases, remain poorly understood. The principal objective of this study was to elucidate whether there are any brain regions that show abnormal response during timing and oddball tasks in patients with SZ. To this end, we conducted a signed differential mapping (SDM) meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies assessing abnormal responses elicited by tasks based on the oddball paradigm in patients with SZ. We conducted a similar SDM meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of timing tasks in SZ. Finally, we undertook a multimodal meta-analysis to detect the common findings of the two previous meta-analyses. We\u00a0found that SZ patients showed hypoactivation in cortical and subcortical areas related to timing. The dysfunction observed during timing tasks partially coincided with deficiencies in change-detection functions (particularly in the case of preattentional processing in the mismatch negativity response). We hypothesize that a dysfunctional timing\/change detection network underlies the cognitive impairment observed in SZ. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by various types of disturbance in perception, emotion, and cognition. Cognitive impairment, a core symptom in this disorder, is highly relevant for prognosis and functional outcome but poorly controlled by treatment ( ;  ) and has been proposed as a critical clinical and therapeutic target ( ). \n\nThe neurocognitive profile of SZ comprises deficits across multiple domains, which include learning and memory, attention, working memory (WM), executive function, and social cognition, all within the context of general intellectual impairment ( ). Several studies using the   Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia   (MATRICS) consensus cognitive battery ( ;  ;  ) have shown that individuals with SZ tend to suffer from disturbance in cognitive performance and that low scores indicate a worse prognosis. \n\nOver recent years, timing dysfunction has become a focus of research interest in SZ. Extensive evidence ( ;  ;  ;  , ) suggests that timing dysfunction is something underlying and at the core of the neurocognitive profile of SZ. Two recent meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies on timing identified a   neural timing circuit   that involved a group of cortical and subcortical regions: the supplementary motor area (SMA), the insula, the left inferior frontal region, the middle frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal region, the left superior temporal gyrus, the right thalamus, the cerebellum, and the left putamen. This circuit was found in healthy subjects; in SZ, however, the participation of this neural timing circuit was significantly reduced, suggesting dysfunction, and there was broad hypoactivation in the right hemisphere ( ;  ). It has been established that timing and other cognitive processes, such as attention, the automatic or controlled modification of behavior, the use of WM, and the adjustment of levels of concentration to task difficulty, employ the same brain networks ( ). Both of these broad categories of function have been reported to become interlinked when there is an increase in the level of cognitive effort demanded, both in healthy control subjects ( , ) and in SZ patients ( ). \n\nAs mentioned above, SZ patients experience deficits in diverse cognitive domains, including the basic ability, required in salience or novelty processing, that enables us to separate what is relevant from what is a distraction. A central abnormality in SZ is aberrant activity in the salience network (SN), which is thought to detect salient changes within a task and to respond to novel stimuli across sensory modalities ( ). It involves activations in the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), the anterior insula, the anterior middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the SMA. The SN operates on two levels: a primitive, automatic (bottom-up) level responsible for preattentional change detection; and a higher-order, controlled level, which involves attention and goal-oriented responses ( ). \n\nAn experimental design widely used in the investigation of dysfunctional target processing is the oddball paradigm, in which infrequent target (  oddball  ) stimuli are interspersed in a sequence of more numerous non-target (  standard  ) stimuli. This paradigm can use either passive (\u201cpreattentional\u201d) or active (\u201cattentional\u201d) tasks that assess neural responses to deviant\/infrequent stimuli. SZ patients are impaired at such oddball detection tasks, as they are at other tasks of target detection ( ;  ). Oddball tasks involve two separate attentional processes: maintenance of attentional readiness, and detection of an infrequent change in the environment. This latter process of change detection might be regarded as novelty processing in the context of a framework of time, and the question arises of whether timing tasks might serve - in the same way that oddball tasks do - to assess a person's performance at change detection in perceptual processes. \n\nOddball detection studies have revealed two highly characteristic event-related potentials (ERP): the P300 wave, which is elicited by rare, cognitively relevant (target) stimuli; and mismatch negativity (MMN), which is the type of ERP elicited by deviants within a sequence of repetitive preattentional stimuli ( ). Reduced MMN amplitude in the auditory modality is one of the best-replicated and documented neurophysiological deficits in SZ ( ). Some studies show evidence for the existence of MMN potential analogues in the visual and somatosensory modalities ( ). Because MMN underlies diverse neurobiological mechanisms connected with SZ cognitive deficits, including aberrant SN activity, reduced MMN amplitude has been proposed as a biomarker for different core impairments in SZ ( ). \n\nDeficits in target detection during oddball tasks in SZ have been well established by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies ( ;  ). Both the ventral (salience) and dorsal (sustained) attentional networks appear to contribute to the dysfunction in neural activation to salient events ( ). Neural generators of the P300 wave have been localized to several regions that partially overlap with the ventral attentional network; these regions include the TPJ, regions in the posterior superior parietal area, the ACC, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and regions of the medial temporal zone ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nSeveral studies suggest that there exists a connection between timing and saliency or novelty processing ( ;  ;  ). Saliency processing requires a change detection mechanism capable of filtering and amplifying infrequent stimuli whether encountered in space or in time. The connection also involves shared neuroanatomical bases but can also be addressed from the perspective of allocation of cognitive resources to targets that imply a key function for survival ( ). The link between timing and saliency processing is not well understood as there is little solid research available. Therefore, dysfunctions involving both functions are little-studied. \n\nThe present study addresses the question of whether a dysfunctional timing network is associated with change detection deficits in SZ. We hypothesize that an aberrant timing network underlies the change detection network dysfunction in SZ subjects. \n\nOur strategy is to identify, for SZ subjects, the neural regions underlying impaired timing in timing tasks and impaired change detection in oddball detection tasks and then to determine whether the dysfunctional timing activity pattern matches that observed for tasks based on the oddball paradigm. To this end, we carried out two signed differential mapping (SDM) meta-analyses - both of fMRI studies - in which SZ and HC subjects are compared in terms of brain response to timing tasks and to oddball detection tasks. After this, we undertook a third, multimodal, meta-analysis to identify brain regions common to patterns found in the two task-specific SDM meta-analyses. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \nWe conducted three independent comprehensive literature searches for whole-brain fMRI studies that compared patients with SZ and HC using timing and oddball tasks. The searches were applied to the PubMed search engine up to November 2017. Keywords used in the first search were: ((Schizophrenia*) AND (functional magnetic resonance imaging*) AND (timing*)). In the second search, keywords used were: ((Schizophrenia*) AND (functional magnetic resonance imaging*) AND (oddball*)). Keywords used in the last search were: ((Schizophrenia*) AND (functional magnetic resonance imaging*) AND (mismatch negativity*)). \n\nInclusion criteria were that studies 1) used samples composed of both healthy volunteers and patients with SZ; 2) included use of a timing or oddball task whether standardized or designed specifically for the study concerned; 3) provided peak coordinates or statistical parametric maps in the published article; 4) made use of whole brain analyses; 5) employed a constant statistical threshold for each different region of the brain. A study was excluded if it 1) used a region-of-interest (ROI) approach; 2) did not report peak coordinates; 3) used different statistical thresholds for different brain regions; 4) was based on techniques other than fMRI (e.g., PET, SPECT); 5) was a case report, a qualitative study, a review or meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies in terms of the inclusion\/exclusion criteria. The title and abstract were first screened for keywords, and after that, if the study was eligible, the full text was analyzed. When reviewers' independent decisions about inclusion or exclusion differed, the final decision was determined by discussion between the two reviewers. \n\nFrom each dataset were obtained coordinates and t-values of the peaks of the clusters of activation differences between patients and controls. Spatial summarization of the data was carried out using anisotropic effect-size seed-based mapping software version 5.141 (AES-SDM; a quantitative voxel-based meta-analytic method formerly known as Signed Differential Mapping,  ;  ;  ). The SDM is a statistical technique for meta-analyzing studies that use neuroimage techniques (fMRI, PET, VBM or DTI) to differentiate brain activity or structure. In contrast to previous metanalytic methods (ALE or Kendel Density Analysis (KDA)), SDM addresses between-studies heterogeneity, incorporates meta-regression methods and allows multimodal meta-analysis ( ). First, we created a brain map of the effect size of the difference between the two groups for each study, based on the collected coordinates and t-values of cluster peaks. Second, we meta-analyzed these study maps fitting models for standard random-effects, which consider sample-size, intra-study variability, and between-study heterogeneity. Finally, we used a spatial permutation test to derive the statistical significance and we thresholded the results with the default parameters of the software. \n\n### Meta-analysis for timing studies \n  \nWe conducted a SDM meta-analysis of fMRI studies that assessed HC and SZ subjects for brain response during timing tasks. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis for attentional oddball studies \n  \nFor tasks based on the oddball paradigm, we did a similar SDM meta-analysis study to the one described above for timing. The analysis was of fMRI studies assessing HC and SZ subjects during oddball tasks that were almost exclusively attentional as opposed to pre-attentional; there was only one study of preattentional oddball detection that met our inclusion criteria. \n\n\n### Multimodal meta-analysis for timing and attentional oddball studies \n  \nWe performed a multimodal meta-analysis to conflate the results of the timing meta-analysis with the results of the attentional oddball detection meta-analysis. The goal of this multimodal analysis was to find brain regions that show an abnormal response both in timing and in oddball tasks. To this end, the maps of the abnormal response to timing were overlapped with the map of the abnormal response to oddball detection. Rather than using a simple overlap of maps, the method used was a modification of the probability of the union of the maps ( ) because this latter method is reported to better accommodate the presence of any P-value error in individual meta-analyses. \n\n\n### Multimodal meta-analysis for timing and preattentional oddball studies \n  \nWe could not conduct a similar multimodal meta-analysis for timing and preattentional oddball studies because we had not been able to derive p-values for the latter. We conducted instead an exploratory overlap to detect brain regions that might show an abnormal response both in timing and in preattentional oddball tasks. Specifically, we selected those voxels that showed at least small effect sizes (0.2) in both the timing and preattentional oddball tasks. We only report clusters with an extent of at least 100 voxels. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Studies included and their characteristics \n  \nInitial searching found several hundred papers, but only nine conformed to the inclusion criteria. Of these, three studied timing (a total of 53 SZ patients and 60 HC subjects), five examined attentional oddball detection (100 SZ; 122 HC), and one examined preattentional oddball detection (24 SZ; 24 HC) (see Supplementary Material, Tables  ,  , and  ).   \nStudies of timing in SZ included in our SDM meta-analysis. \n  Table 1       \nStudies of attentional oddball in SZ included in our SDM meta-analysis. \n  Table 2       \nStudies of preattentional oddball in SZ included in our SDM meta-analysis. \n  Table 3     \n\n\n### Meta-analysis results for timing studies \n  \nRelative to HC subjects, those with SZ demonstrated significant hypoactivation in the right striatum, the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9 and 45), and the right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (BA 32) (  and  ).

In addition, the area corresponding to the right inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40), which was hypoactivated by attentional oddball tasks in SZ subjects relative to controls, was found to overlap with the map of the abnormal response observed with timing tasks (in SZ and HC subjects in general) (  and  ).

The study, therefore, supports the idea of an interrelationship between temporal processing and salience processing (of both attentional and preattentional stimuli) in SZ. \n\nTiming is a primary cognitive domain that underlies or broadly influences other cognitive processes ( ). In previous studies, we established that timing structures can be activated by cognitive demands such as cognitive control tasks in which there is variation in the degree of difficulty ( ). To explain this finding, we suggested the existence of a temporal-cognitive control network ( ), proposing that this network responds to changes in how demanding a task is. The idea of a temporal-cognitive control network leads on to the notion that, because temporality is change related, neural circuits involved in timing might be expected to overlap with other networks involved in cognitive functions whenever a change in the degree of task difficulty occurs ( ). This is the reasoning by which we came to look at the change detection mechanism as a target for study. As the change detection mechanism is a core feature of novelty processing, we hypothesized that regions implicated in timing may overlap with the cognitive saliency network. Having carried out our research, we conclude that timing dysfunction can be related to any kind of cognitive task, whether it is salience detection or cognitive control, as long as it involves change detection. \n\nOur results show dysfunctional participation of frontal, cingulate, and parietal regions during both timing and attentional oddball tasks in SZ. In line with previous fMRI studies ( ), we observed a pattern of frontal and parietal activity associated with heterogeneous cognitive demands (i.e., attention, WM, executive control, response selection). This is in agreement with a \u201cmultiple-demand system\u201d thought to extend over a group of regions in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. These regions - to be more precise - comprise the cortex in and surrounding the posterior part of the inferior frontal sulcus, the cortex in the anterior insula and the adjacent frontal operculum, the cortex in the pre-SMA and the dorsal anterior cingulate, and the cortex in the area of the intraparietal sulcus ( ). For this reason, and in conjunction with the fact that the timing and oddball tasks involved in the various studies all engage diverse cognitive demands, our observation of general fronto-parietal activation in connection with attentional activity is not surprising. \n\nRegarding the fMRI overlapping observed with timing and preattentional oddball paradigm-based tasks, SZ subjects showed significant hypoactivation, relative to HC subjects, in timing-related cortical-subcortical areas (particularly in the right frontal region, parietal region, insula, SMA, anterior cingulate, striatum, and thalamus). This finding is in agreement with previous meta-analyses ( ;  ) carried out to explore the neuroanatomical basis of timing: SZ subjects showed, in comparison to controls, significantly lower activation of most right hemisphere regions of the time circuit. \n\nNeuroimaging studies comparing brain activation in SZ and HC subjects during cognitive functions have revealed aberrant activations patterns in SZ patients. The published results are inconclusive with regard to the nature of brain activations in SZ and whether they are hypo- or hyper-activations ( ). Although several studies have found lower activation in networks related to cognitive processes and interpreted this as evidence of deficient functioning in SZ subjects ( ;  ,  ), other authors ( ;  ) have suggested that both hypo- and hyper-activation might be necessary for efficient cognitive functioning because the up-regulation of one network will require the down-regulation of another ( ). In the light of this latter theory and in explanation of the rather equivocal research results, it has been hypothesized that SZ subjects present difficulties in shifting from a baseline network activity to networks implicated in task performance. This hypothesis is explored by   in their study of an auditory oddball task.   conducted research to compare the decrease and increase of signal during fMRI epochs that alternate in terms of whether tasks are present or absent. They found sustained hyper-activation of the default mode of a network and a reduced signal in some networks implicated during cognitive tasks. Their results suggest that SZ subjects have difficulty in reallocating cognitive resources when transitioning between a state of relative cognitive rest to a situation that requires active processing. Since most cognitive functions are related to timing, we hypothesize that the deactivation or low activation in SZ subjects is related to timing deficits. According to our own previous meta-analysis, lower recruitment in timing regions, especially in the right hemisphere is associated with worse performance in temporality tasks ( ;  ). \n\nSeveral studies report the involvement of a dysfunctional, neurophysiological cortical-subcortical circuit connected with temporal and salience processing in SZ ( ;  ;  ). The current study provides further support to these observations. We found that the dysfunctional regions associated with timing were engaged by oddball style tasks in SZ (particularly with preattentional stimuli during MMN). This overlap went beyond regions that are expected for a \u201cmultiple-demand system\u201d operative for attentional activity (frontal dorsolateral and parietal) ( ), suggesting a wider common denominator. Furthermore, our study found that SZ patients had deficits in areas (i.e., the frontal region, parietal, insula, cingulate, SMA) that are known to mediate SN in HC subject. Thus, our results are in agreement with other neuroimaging studies that have found SZ subjects to have significantly lower activation, relative to controls, of most regions of the SN ( ). \n\nIn line with previous combined ERP and fMRI studies ( ), our findings reinforce the idea that deficits during an oddball task in SZ are linked with a specific location of dysfunction: the ventral (salience) attentional network. Like Wynn et\u00a0al., we also found that SZ subjects exhibited reduced fMRI neural activation, compared with controls, not just in the ventral but also in the dorsal attentional network. In contrast with the dorsal network, which is believed to focus attention to a task in a general sense relative to other tasks, the ventral network is involved in the detection of salient changes within a task that is already underway ( ). Whereas the dorsal network comprises activation in the inferior frontal junction, medial intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and middle temporal area, the ventral network comprises activation in the temporal parietal junction, anterior insula, anterior middle frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and SMA ( ). \n\n suggested that SZ patients are less efficient when it comes to the reorientation of processing resources used by an ongoing task that involves the detection of and response to task-relevant target stimuli. The results of the current study support this hypothesis. During novel stimulus processing, SZ subjects were characterized, relative to HC subjects, by hypoactivity in the right amygdala\u2013hippocampus, within the paralimbic cortex in the rostral anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the right frontal operculum, and in the association cortex at the right temporo-parietal-occipital junction, bilateral intraparietal sulcus, and the bilateral dorsal frontal cortex. With regard to the subcortex, relative hypoactivation during the processing of novel stimuli occurred in the cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Our results show no significant group differences between HC and SZ subjects in cerebellum activation. In this respect, an absence of cerebellar participation when dealing with timing tasks was also reported by  . \n\nIn addition to playing an important role in the detection of salient events and reacting to them, the SN also facilitates access to attention and WM resources when a salient event is detected ( ). The overlap between regions involved in both temporal and salience processing could be interpreted to indicate that both functions require similar cognitive abilities, such as attention, WM, or executive functions. Parallel to the observation that certain brain regions traditionally thought to be involved with timing (such as frontal, thalamus, and striatum) are engaged during oddball tasks in response to target detection, we hypothesize that specific brain regions usually associated with cognitive domains (such as the prefrontal cortex and fronto-parietal regions) are engaged during timing tasks. We also suggest the possibility that the timing dysfunction (variability and inaccuracy) and the change detection impairments observed in SZ subjects are interrelated in SZ. Our current findings agree with previous studies -   reported the engagement of timing network by an increase in the difficulty of non-temporal tasks - that support the notion that timing is change-related. Thus, the temporal-salience network might underlie all mental processes involved in or activated by change detection. \n\n, using simultaneous fMRI and ERP techniques, examined attentional modulation as it occurred during a task whose difficulty was varied, and which was based on an oddball-like paradigm requiring detection of irrelevant deviance. They found that processing of stimuli that were not the main focus of attention depended on the nature and scale of the attentional demands required to process features of the stimulus. Additionally, and in line with our results, they found that the degree of difficulty of a task affected several critical ERP components, such as MMN and N1 and P3a. MMN, which measures bottom-up passive deviance detection, was relatively higher for an easy version of the task and was associated with more dorsal activation of the supratemporal plane. N1 and P3a components, which are related to top-down involuntary shifts of attention to deviant stimuli, were relatively higher for a difficult version of the task. Processing of sensory deviance was associated with brain activations in the ventral areas of the superior temporal cortex. Therefore, these results show that dorsal regions are primarily activated in response to passive detection of MMN between the standard stimuli and the incoming deviant stimuli. In a broader sense, Sabri et\u00a0al.'s results suggest that both dorsal and ventral auditory regions in the superior temporal gyrus are modulated by ongoing attentional demands. Thus, it could be argued that MMN is preattentive, and cognitive control is a factor that participates in the regulation of and transition between preattentional and attentional tasks. \n\nWe, therefore, conclude with a working hypothesis that whereas preattentional oddball detection is related to an   automatic   timing system, which gauges time without recourse to cognitive modulation (and is mainly concerned with time of less than a second in duration), attentional oddball detection relates to a   cognitively-controlled   timing system, which is based on higher-level cognitive circuits (that are primarily needed for gauging time intervals that last for several seconds or longer). \n\n suggested that there exists a general system that underlies perception of different magnitudes, such as space, quantity, and time. Apparently, these perceptual functions are interrelated and share neuroanatomical bases (Magnani et\u00a0al., 2014). Our proposal of a cognitive common denominator in timing and salience processing goes beyond the Walsh \u201cGeneral Magnitude System.\u201d We further suggest that the timing network involves both magnitude and cognitive (preattentional and attentional) information processing. \n\nThe philosophical notion that time is related to how we perceive changes in what is salient to us has been around since the days of Aristotle. Change and hence time is ubiquitous in nature and in the human environment, and consequently, the human mind needs to be able to perceive what is changing and respond appropriately ( ). In this context, the existence of neurological networks in common to deal with time and salience would hardly be surprising. \n\nMeta-analyses, in general, suffer from limitations, and this study is no exception. In particular, the fact that peak-based meta-analyses are based on coordinates from published studies rather than raw statistical brain maps makes data less accurate. It should be born in mind; however, that voxel-wise meta-analytical methods, such as those used here, tend towards false negatives rather than the false positives ( ). A principal drawback of our meta-analysis is the small number of studies included; this was due to the scarcity of suitable publications. Further studies are required to verify the accuracy and reliability of our results. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, SZ subjects show consistent brain activity deficits in brain regions that are conventionally associated not only with timing but also with change detection. The implication is that timing dysfunction might underlie aberrant SN and MMN, and therefore be a primary cognitive deficit in SZ. From our findings, we suggest that the temporal\/change-detection impairment displayed in SZ subjects is connected specifically with a fronto-thalamo-striatal dysfunction. Our findings indicate that disruption in time processing is the central cognitive deficit in this disorder. The results reported here are, however, preliminary, and further studies are needed to address the specific role of timing on cognition in SZ. \n\n\n## Declarations \n  \n### Author contribution statement \n  \nIrene Al\u00fastiza, Mar\u00eda Sol Garc\u00e9s, Javier Goena: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Wrote the paper. \n\nAleix Solanes, Joaquim Radua: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data. \n\nMarta Ortu\u00f1o, Patricio Molero, Felipe Ortu\u00f1o: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data. \n\n\n### Funding statement \n  \nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. \n\n\n### Competing interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n### Additional information \n  \nNo additional information is available for this paper. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6287083,"text_md5":"a1f93392d548cf8b370d1caec9f8f866","field_positions":{"authors":[0,151],"journal":[152,159],"publication_year":[161,165],"title":[176,289],"keywords":[303,347],"abstract":[360,1625],"body":[1634,34227]},"batch":1,"pmid":30582035,"doi":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2018.e01004","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6287083","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6287083"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6287083\">6287083<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6287083  Aberrant timing and oddball detection in Schizophrenia: findings from a signed differential mapping meta-analysis"}

Much effort is being made to identify brain imaging biomarkers and develop tools that could facilitate its diagnosis. In particular, using Machine Learning classifiers based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data is promising, but there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy and reliability. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence in the literature so far. A bivariate random-effects meta-analytic model was implemented to investigate the sensitivity and specificity across the 55 studies that offered sufficient information for quantitative analysis. Our results indicated overall summary sensitivity and specificity estimates of 73.8% and 74.8%, respectively. SVM stood out as the most used classifier, presenting summary estimates above 76%. Studies with bigger samples tended to obtain worse accuracies, except in the subgroup analysis for ANN classifiers. The use of other brain imaging or phenotypic data to complement rs-fMRI information seems promising, achieving higher sensitivities when compared to rs-fMRI data alone (84.7% versus 72.8%). Finally, our analysis showed AUC values between acceptable and excellent. Still, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of those classification algorithms to clinical settings. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental condition associated with the atypical development of the brain. Individuals in this group, in general, present a slow development in certain activities when compared to individuals of Typical Development (TD)\u2014such as speech, motor coordination, and social activities\u2014and difficulties communicating and relating to others . \n\nDespite being considered a neurological disorder, the diagnosis of ASD remains exclusively based on behavioral criteria . This may be due to the great heterogeneity within the population, possibly reflecting an enormous amount of different neurodevelopmental etiologies . \n\nTypically identified in early childhood, ASD\u2019s development is believed to have genetic and environmental roots . According to recent publications , the former accounts for approximately 80% of the cases. Also, epidemiological studies suggest an increase in its global prevalence in recent years, and a systematic review published in 2012 estimated it to be about 0.62% . \n\nThe impact of this condition on the quality of life extends beyond the affected individual to the entire family. For example, parents of children with ASD report higher stress levels than parents of children with other disabilities . Also, the majority of researches regarding autism is based on data from high-income countries. This creates inequities across the world in access to services and supports . \n\nOn the other hand, given the brain\u2019s plasticity during the first years of life, early detection paired with early treatment would have considerably stronger benefits than later treatments . \n\nThe gold standard diagnosis of ASD is based on a differential diagnostic examination by an experienced clinician, frequently supported by tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) \u2014a standardized caregiver interview\u2014and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS\/-2) \u2014a semi-structured standardized observation for individuals with suspected ASD. Therefore, this is a long and time-consuming process that requires a multi-disciplinary team to assess information from various sources . \n\nIn recent years, Machine Learning (ML) classifiers have been increasingly applied to neuroimaging data to diagnose psychiatric disorders, including ASD. Those classification methods hold the promise of facilitating and speeding up the diagnostic process . \n\nThroughout the different types of neuroimaging data, the resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used to investigate neural connectivity and identify biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. It is based on spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal obtained through a non-invasive and relatively fast acquisition process. Also, the rs-fMRI is task-free\u2014requiring no active and focused participation of the patient\u2014and the data can be easily combined to generate large databases . \n\nWe can highlight the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) as one example of such databases. Together, the first  and second  versions of the repository (ABIDE\u00a0I and ABIDE\u00a0II) aggregate rs-fMRI and corresponding structural data of more than 2000 individuals with ASD and of TD collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories. \n\nStudies using rs-fMRI data have revealed brain functional connectivity patterns that could serve as biomarkers for classifying depression , Parkinson\u2019s disease , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , ASD , and even age . However, the reproducibility and generalizability of these approaches in research or clinical settings are debatable. There are many potential sources of variation across studies, and its effect on diagnosis and biomarker extraction is still poorly understood . \n\nTherefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that used ML classifiers based on rs-fMRI data to distinguish patients with ASD from individuals of TD. We aimed to critically review the current literature on this area based on the following research questions:   \nWhich ML techniques are used to classify ASD and TD individuals based on rs-fMRI? \n  \nWhat are the results obtained by the studies using these approaches? \n  \nWhich methodological differences are associated with the performance measures obtained throughout the publications? \n  \nThe approaches are robust enough to be applied in a clinical setting? \n  \nWhat are the aspects that still need to be investigated? \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe searched for articles using four digital libraries and a backward snowballing approach \u2014i.e., looking for new relevant articles in the references of the selected ones. Three authors conducted a selection process based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles were pre-selected if at least one author concluded they should be, and the final selected papers were defined by consensus. \n\nData extraction was performed on the selected articles using a standardized data extraction sheet, considering only one result per independent sample. Publications with enough information to obtain measures of True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) were included in the meta-analysis. Also, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)  was applied to assess studies\u2019 methodological quality. More details of our methodology can be found in \u201c \u201d section. \n\nThe following subsections present the characteristics of the studies selected for (i) the systematic review and (ii) the meta-analysis, and the results of (iii) the quality assessment and (iv) the quantitative meta-analysis. \n\n### General study characteristics \n  \nA total of 93  studies were selected for the systematic review. Figure   summarizes our selection methodology and the details according to the screening stage. Also, the final publications identified and selected can be found as Supplementary Tables  \u2013 .   \nScreening and selection of studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria at different stages of the meta-analysis. The numbers between parentheses indicate the total of articles remaining after each step. The numbers separated by   indicate the count of articles from the first and second search, respectively. Created with Lucidchart Free  . \n  \n\nAll the 93 studies were published between 2013 and 2020 and used samples that varied from 24 to 2352 individuals. The most commonly applied ML techniques for classification were Support Vector Machine (SVM,  ) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN,  ), followed by studies that used more than one technique (M,  ). Figure   shows the distribution of the selected articles by year and ML technique used, whereas Table   shows the general characteristics of the included studies.   \nDistribution of the selected studies by year of publication and type of ML technique used (  MV\/MT   multiview\/multitask learning,   RF   Random Forest,   LR   Logistic Regression;   LDA   Linear Discriminant Analysis). The numbers inside the bars indicate each article. Created with Microsoft Excel 2019. \n    \nGeneral characteristics of the studies selected in the systematic review (SR) and the studies and samples included in the meta-analysis (MA). \n  \nNote that for the dataset, sex, and age of the subjects, the sum of the column Studies (MA) is greater than 55 due to articles with multiple samples included in different categories. \n\n L-SVM   Linear SVM,   CNN   Convolutional Neural Network,   Ridge   Ridge classifier,   XGB   Extreme Gradient Boosting,   Affine   Affine-Invariant,   y.o.   years old,   FIQ   Full Intelligence Quotient. \n\nSignificance values are given in italics. \n  \n\nAlmost 85% of the studies ( ) extracted their samples from versions of the ABIDE, specially ABIDE\u00a0I preprocessed ( ) or ABIDE without specifying the version ( ). The other articles used data from the UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Database  (UMCD,  ), the National Database of Autism Research (NDAR,  ) [ ], own samples ( ), own samples and ABIDE ( ), others ( ). \n\nThe majority of the studies ( ) used only rs-fMRI data for classification. Beyond that, some studies used other types of brain imaging data ( ) or phenotypic data ( ). \n\nRegarding the subjects\u2019 characteristics, we found studies that included both males and females ( ), only male subjects ( ), and studies that did not present enough information regarding the sex of the selected individuals ( ). Furthermore, there were samples with subjects both above and below 18 years old ( ), only below 18 ( ), only above 18 ( ), and studies without enough information ( ). \n\n\n### Studies included in the meta-analysis \n  \nFrom the 93 studies selected for the systematic review, 27  did not report any data regarding sensitivity or specificity and were excluded from the meta-analysis. Five articles  did not present the exact number of TD and ASD subjects on the sample or the test set, making it impossible to calculate the measures necessary for the meta-analysis. Two articles  defined specific sample percentages as training or test sets and performed some random trials. Thus, it was impossible to determine the exact number of subjects in the test set nor the proportion of ASD and TD subjects. In another study , seven subjects had corrupted rs-fMRI imaging files, so they were included in the structural MRI (sMRI) analysis and excluded from fMRI analysis and sMRI-fMRI modalities fusion. However, the study did not inform from which group (ASD or TD) those subjects were. \n\nTwo articles  presented their results through bar charts without showing the exact sensitivity and specificity values, so we decided not to include them in the meta-analysis. In another publication , an RF was used as the classifier, and sensitivity and specificity measures were presented only for the external validation data-set. The main results from the article were obtained through the out-of-bag (OOB) error\u2014by subsampling with replacement to create training samples for each tree, the excluded data are used for testing, and the mean of the results generates the OOB error\u2014but only the accuracy was reported. Since the results from the validation data-set and the ones obtained using the OOB error presented high variation, we decided not to use the results from this article. However, those three articles were included in a sensitivity analysis to assess their effect on the meta-analysis results. \n\nFinally, 55 studies \u2014published between 2013 and 2019\u2014provided sufficient data for a quantitative meta-analysis. Note that the information presented in the rest of this section is related to the main results extracted from those studies, as described in \u201c \u201d section. \n\nSince some studies comprise multiple samples, a total of 132 independent samples were extracted, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 37.5% to 100% and 20% to 100%, respectively. About 85% of the studies extracted their samples from versions of the ABIDE, corresponding to 93% of the samples. A coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity for all the samples included in the meta-analysis can be found as Supplementary Fig.  . Table   also presents the general characteristics of the studies and samples included. \n\nFrom all samples, 123 used ABIDE data in the test sets. To better understand their overlap, we calculated how many samples used each ABIDE site. Sixteen of them did not present enough information to define which sites they came from. ABIDE I was used in 100 samples, while ABIDE II was used in nine. Note that some samples comprised both versions of the database and, for this analysis, we defined the ABIDE version according to the sites\u2019 names presented if the articles did not directly specify which ABIDE they used. \n\nIn the case of ABIDE I, each site was used from 13 to 33 times throughout the samples, with a mean of 19.2 samples using each site. Besides, 60 samples used only one site, 16 samples used two sites, and seven samples used all ABIDE I sites. As for ABIDE II, ignoring the sites that were not used, each site was used from one to three times, with a mean of 1.5 samples using each site. In this case, six samples used only one site. \n\nIt is worth noticing that a site being used in 33 samples does not mean a complete overlap 33 times since each sample used a different number of subjects from each site. Even knowing the number of subjects used from each site in each sample and the total number of subjects available in each site, one cannot assess the extent of the overlap once it is not known which specific subjects were used. In fact, only two of the articles  presented which subjects from ABIDE were used in their studies. \n\nBeyond that, less than 50% of the studies (  articles\/61 samples) presented the mean age, almost 24% ( ) had not enough information regarding the sex of the subjects, and only 20% ( ) presented the mean FIQ of their ASD and TD samples. Also, only 1 of the samples  used in the meta-analysis\u2014a multi-site dataset from Japan\u2014was not from North America or Europe.   \nConceptual map of ML techniques used throughout the articles selected for meta-analysis (number of articles\/number of samples). Created with Lucidchart Free  . \n  \n\nMost of the articles defined Regions of Interest (ROIs) of the brain to reduce the dimensionality of their features using a priori atlases or combinations of them ( ), especially the Automated Anatomical Labelling  in versions of 90 (AAL90,  ) and 116 ROIs (AAL116,  ) and the Craddock atlas with 200 ROIs  (CC200,  ). \n\nThroughout the studies, there were various approaches to extract features from the data, from different points of view, and in varying levels of complexity. However, the most used type of features consisted of estimating functional connectivity (FC) patterns  using the Pearson Correlation (PC) between all pairs of averaged time-series. Those studies used the PC either on its original version ( ) or normalized by Fisher transformation ( ). \n\nAccording to the main results, the techniques used for classification are presented through a conceptual map in Fig.  . \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe QUADAS-2 is a tool designed to assess the quality of primary diagnostic accuracy studies, evaluating if systematic flaws or limitations might distort their results\u2014i.e., if there is a Risk of Bias (RoB)\u2014and if these studies apply to the review\u2019s research question . \n\nFigure   shows the distribution of the results of QUADAS-2 considering all the publications selected for the systematic review or the studies included in the meta-analysis (see Supplementary Table  ). The only difference in the results between the two applications of the tool was in the RoB by index test. Since some of the results in the articles did not have enough information to be used in the meta-analysis, three studies  showed low RoB by index test when assessed as a whole, but when considering only the results used for the meta-analysis they presented unclear RoB.   \nRisk of bias and applicability concerns by domain in QUADAS-2 for all the studies selected for the systematic review (left) and considering only the ones included in the meta-analysis (right). Created with Microsoft Excel 2019. \n  \n\nWe can highlight that none of the studies was considered to have a low RoB by patient selection domain. Most of them had an unclear RoB (62 out of 93 in the first and 30 out of 55 in the second application) since they used databases such as the ABIDE and did not present details regarding the recruitment of the subjects nor sufficient information of the characteristics of the subjects selected. The remaining articles were shown to have a high RoB due mainly to the selection of subjects in restricted intervals of age and intelligence quotient (IQ) or the exclusion of female subjects. \n\nThe great majority of the studies were considered to have an unclear RoB by flow and timing domain (81 and 48 studies) mainly because they did not present the interval between the application of the index test and the reference standard nor sufficient information to conclude if all subjects received the same reference standard. \n\nAll of the articles were shown to have a low RoB by reference standard domain given that we considered the reference standards used in databases such as the ABIDE as reliable even if the article did not present exactly what reference standards were used. For the same reason, all of the studies were assessed to have low concerns regarding applicability by the same domain. We highlight that the reference standards used throughout the studies were similar to those used in ABIDE : combining clinical judgment and diagnostic instruments; clinical judgment only; or diagnostic tools only. \n\nMore than half of the articles were considered to have an unclear or high RoB (54 and 33) by the index test domain. Also, most of the studies (86 and 52) were assessed to have low concerns regarding applicability by the same domain. Finally, all of the articles were shown to have low concerns regarding applicability by the patient selection domain. \n\nAccording to the first application of the QUADAS-2 tool, the RoB was judged as high in at least one category in 42 studies, and 12 studies presented a high RoB in at least two domains. Finally, according to the second analysis, the RoB was judged as high in at least one category in 29 studies, and 9 studies presented a high RoB in at least two domains. \n\n\n### Diagnostic accuracy \n  \nAs commented before, there is a literature limitation regarding sample overlap. This should be taken in consideration while analyzing the quantitative results presented in this section. The implications and other considerations regarding this issue can be found in \u201c \u201d section. \n\nUsing the bivariate model, machine learning-based classifiers separated ASD from TD with a sensitivity of 73.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.8\u201375.8%), a specificity of 74.8% (95% CI 72.3\u201377.1%), and area under the curve (AUC)\/partial AUC (pAUC) of 0.803\/0.765. A Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve of the included studies\u2014along with the estimated summary point, confidence region, and prediction region\u2014is presented in Fig.  a. Of the 132 samples, 40 were outside the 95% predictive region of the SROC curve, indicating heterogeneity. All the results obtained with the main analysis can be found in Supplementary Table  .   \nSROC curves of all the included studies with summary estimate   (a)   and the studies using SVM and ANN with their summary estimates and confidence region   (b)  . Created with R Statistics  version 4.1.1 using the package mada  version 0.5.10. \n  \n\nRegression with year of publication did not affect sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ), even segregating per type of ML technique. \n\n#### ML technique and sample size \n  \nConsidering the type of ML technique, only SVM and ANN classification tools were used in 5 or more articles. When analyzing the SVM studies, we obtained a sensitivity of 76.3% (95% CI 73.2\u201379.2%), a specificity of 77.5% (95% CI 73.7\u201380.8%), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.832\/0.748. The ANN studies had a sensitivity of 68.4% (95% CI 65\u201371.5%), a specificity of 70.2% (95% CI 66.2\u201373.9%), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.743\/0.582. The SROC curves for the studies using SVM and ANN are presented in Fig.  b. We performed a subgroup analysis and found a significant difference between the sensitivities ( ) and the specificities ( ). However, after correction for multiple comparisons, only the difference in sensitivities remained significant. \n\nWe also analyzed the subtype of ML technique. For SVM, only L-SVM was used in five or more articles - sensitivity of 73.9% (95% CI 70.2-77.2%), specificity of 77.5% (95% CI 73.3\u201381.2%), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.813\/0.708\u2014whereas for ANN the same happened with CNN - sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI 63.3\u201369.9%), specificity of 70.1% (95% CI 66.3\u201373.7%), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.732\/0.565. Thus, we compared L-SVM with other types of SVM and CNN with other types of ANN. The comparison showed no effect on sensitivity or specificity (all  ). Finally, the comparison with L-SVM against CNN indicated higher sensitivity ( ) and specificity ( ) in L-SVM studies. However, neither of those effects survived multiple comparisons correction.   \nLinear regression models with sample size predicting sensitivity   (a)   and specificity   (b)   for all the studies. Created with R Statistics  version 4.1.1 using the package mada  version 0.5.10. \n  \n\nRegression with sample size as moderator showed a significant effect on both sensitivity ( ) and specificity ( ) when analyzing all the samples together, even considering multiple comparisons correction. Figure   shows the linear regression models with sample size predicting sensitivity and specificity and indicates that bigger sample sizes tend to obtain worse accuracies. \n\nHowever, the same analysis segregating the studies per type of ML technique used indicated a significant effect on specificities ( ) and no impact on sensitivities ( ) for SVM studies, with worse specificities in studies with larger samples. Also, no significant effect was found for the ANN studies (all  ). \n\n\n#### Subjects characteristics \n  \nNo significant effects of sex (only males against males and females studies) or FIQ (neither considering the mean FIQ nor comparing studies that used only high-functioning subjects with the ones that used high- and low-functioning subjects) on sensitivity or specificity (all  ) were observed. \n\nRegression with the mean age of the subjects did not affect sensitivity or specificity (all   considering ASD or TD groups). Comparison between samples with subjects under 18 years old and samples composed of individuals both under and above that age showed a significant difference between the specificities ( ) but no effect on sensitivity ( ), indicating higher specificity in studies that used only subjects under 18 y.o. (77.6\u201495% CI 73\u201381.6%\u2014versus 70.5\u201495% CI 66.6\u201374.1%). This effect, however, did not survive multiple comparisons correction. Segregating per type of ML technique, only SVM had enough studies (17 studies and 37 samples) to conduct the analysis. Still, the results did not show any effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ). Sensitivity analysis considering other age thresholds (19, 20, 21) yielded the same conclusions (see Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n#### Sources of the samples \n  \nSubgroup analysis considering the database or source of the sample (ABIDE without version\u2014comprising the studies that did not specify which version of ABIDE they were using\u2014ABIDE\u00a0I preprocessed or ABIDE\u00a0I + ABIDE\u00a0II) indicated a significant effect on the sensitivity when comparing ABIDE without version with ABIDE I preprocessed ( ) or ABIDE\u00a0I + ABIDE\u00a0II ( ). In both cases, the ABIDE without version group presented higher sensitivity (77.1%\u201495% CI 73.2\u201380.6%\u2014versus 72%\u201495% CI 69\u201374.9%\u2014and 69.2%\u201495% CI 65.8\u201372.4%\u2014respectively). Nevertheless, this effect did not survive multiple comparisons. All the other analyses indicated no significant impact on sensitivity or specificity (all  ). The same analysis with SVM samples (ABIDE without version or ABIDE\u00a0I preprocessed) did not indicate any effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ). \n\nWe conducted another analysis comparing the studies that used any version of ABIDE with studies that used databases or samples other than ABIDE (Own sample, NDAR, UMCD). The regression indicated higher sensitivity ( ) and specificity ( ) in studies that used databases or samples other than ABIDE (Sensitivity: 81.8%\u201495% CI 73.4\u201388.1%\u2014versus 73.2%\u201495% CI 71.1\u201375.2%; Specificity: 83%\u201495% CI 72.5\u201390%\u2014versus 74.1%\u201495% CI 71.6\u201376.5%), but the effects did not survive multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### Features definition \n  \nSubgroup analysis considering type of data (only rs-fMRI or rs-fMRI plus other data types) showed a significant difference between the sensitivities ( ) and the specificities ( ), indicating better results in studies that used other types of data together with rs-fMRI (Sensitivity: 84.7%\u201495% CI 78.5\u201389.4%\u2014 versus 72.8%\u201495% CI 70.6\u201374.8%; Specificity: 81%\u201495% CI 74.1\u201386.3%\u2014versus 73.9%\u201495% CI 71.3\u201376.4%). However, after correction for multiple comparisons, only the difference on sensitivities remained significant. \n\nSubgroup analysis considering the atlas used (AAL90, AAL116 or CC200), indicated that: studies using AAL90 obtained better specificity (74.9%\u201495% CI 68.7\u201380.1%;  ) than studies using CC200 (64.4%\u201495% CI 60.7\u201367.9%) but no significant effect was observed on the sensitivity ( ); studies using AAL116 obtained better sensitivity (77.7%\u201495% CI 73.7\u201381.2%;  ) and specificity (78.2%\u201495% CI 72.8\u201382.9%;  ) than studies using CC200 (Sensitivity: 68%\u201495% CI 65.4\u201370.4%); there was no significant effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ) between studies using AAL 116 or 90. Figure   shows the SROC curves for the studies using AAL90, AAL116 or CC200. All those effects remained significant after multiple comparisons correction.   \nSROC curves of the studies using AAL90, AAL116, or CC200 with their summary estimates and confidence regions. Created with R Statistics  version 4.1.1 using the package mada  version 0.5.10. \n  \n\nRegression considering the number of ROIs used showed significant effects on sensitivity ( ) and specificity ( ). When segregating per ML technique, there was a significant effect on sensitivity ( ) for the SVM studies but no effect on specificity ( ) whereas for the ANN studies there was a significant effect on specificity ( ) but no effect on sensitivity ( ). For all the significant effects, the linear regression models indicated lower values of sensitivity\/specificity as the number of regions increased. None of these effects survived multiple comparisons correction. \n\nSubgroup analysis using the type of feature as moderator (PC, PC Fisher-transformed or others), indicated that: studies using PC (Fisher-transformed) obtained better sensitivity (76.7%\u201495% CI 71.3\u201381.3%;  ) and specificity (81%\u201495% CI 75.6\u201385.4%;  ) than studies using PC (Sensitivity: 68.9%\u201495% CI 66.8\u201370.9%; Specificity: 68.3%\u201495% CI 64.3\u201372.1%); similarly, studies using other features obtained better sensitivity (73.5%\u201495% CI 70.6\u201376.2%;  ) and specificity (74.7%\u201495% CI 71\u201378%;  ) than studies using PC; there was no significant effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ) between studies using PC (Fisher-transformed) and other features. Only the effects of the first analysis survived multiple comparisons. \n\n\n#### QUADAS-2 analyses \n  \nSubgroup analysis considering the number of domains with low RoB in QUADAS-2 results (one or two) showed a significant difference between the specificities ( ) but no effect on sensitivity ( ), indicating higher specificity in studies that had only one domain with a low risk of bias (78.4%\u201495% CI 75.5\u201381.1%\u2014versus 69.6%\u201495% CI 65.9\u201373%). \n\nAnalysis considering the RoB of the index test obtained from QUADAS-2 (high, unclear or low) indicated that: studies with unclear RoB obtained better sensitivity (80.5%\u201495% CI 76.1\u201384.2%;  ) than studies with high RoB (70.1%\u201495% CI 66.3\u201373.5%) but no significant effect was observed on the specificity ( ); studies with high RoB obtained better specificity (76.6%\u2014 95% CI 73.2\u201379.8%;  \u2014did not survive multiple comparisons) than studies with low RoB (69.9%\u201495% CI 66.2\u201373.3%) but no significant effect was observed on the sensitivity ( ); studies with unclear RoB obtained better sensitivity ( \u2014did not survive multiple comparisons) and specificity (81.3%\u201495% CI 76.9\u201385%;  ) than studies with low RoB (Sensitivity: 72.1%\u201495% CI 69.6\u201374.4%). \n\nWe conducted another analysis splitting the studies with low RoB between the ones that performed a temporal (using data from newly recruited subjects) or geographic (using data collected by independent investigators at a different site) validation (5 articles and 35 samples) and the ones that performed a split-sample validation . The conclusions were the same, except for the comparison between the studies with high RoB and the ones with low RoB (split-sample) that did not indicate a significant effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ). Also, there was no effect on sensitivity ( ) or specificity ( ) when comparing the studies that used a split-sample validation and the ones that used a temporal or geographic validation. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses \n  \nSensitivity analysis including three more articles \u2014four new samples\u2014that were initially excluded from the meta-analysis (as cited in \u201c \u201d section) indicated no significant change in overall sensitivity (73.7%\u201495% CI 71.7\u201375.6%) or specificity (75%\u2014 95% CI 72.7\u201377.2%). All the results obtained with this sensitivity analysis can be found in Supplementary Table  . \n\nWe repeated all the tests that the addition of those articles could impact. In general, their influence on the outcome was minor, but the conclusions from the meta-regression differed in three analyses. The regression with type of data as moderator showed the same conclusion for the sensitivities ( ) but no significant effect between the specificities ( ). The regression considering the database or source of the sample indicated no significant effect on sensitivity when comparing ABIDE with ABIDE I preprocessed ( ) or ABIDE I + ABIDE II ( ). Regression with atlas as moderator showed a significant effect on sensitivity ( ) between studies using AAL 116 or 90, indicating higher sensitivity in studies that used the AAL 116 (78%\u201495% CI 74.1\u201381.4%\u2014versus 69.2%\u201495% CI 61.4-76%). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### ML techniques and sample size \n  \nAs shown in Fig.  , the number of publications in the area has been increasing following an exponential trend, and SVM was the most used classification technique, especially until 2018. Also, from the 54 samples that used SVM for classification, 33 of them used an L-SVM. The inherent characteristics of SVMs help them generalize well and deal with noisy, correlated features and high-dimensional data sets . \n\nHowever, we can observe an increasing number of studies using ANN techniques, making it the second most used technique in absolute numbers and the first when considering only articles published in 2019. Many ANN classifiers used deep-learning methods, especially the Convolutional Neural Network, corresponding to more than 35% of the ANN techniques. \n\nDespite that, analysis considering the type of classification algorithm used indicated better results for SVM against ANN, especially on sensitivity. Also, the analysis comparing L-SVM and CNN resulted in the same conclusions (although not surviving multiple comparisons). In all those cases, the difference was about seven percentage points. \n\nMore complex models\u2014such as deep-learning ones\u2014tend to be more powerful but generally have more hyperparameters. Therefore, they are potentially more capable of explaining noise in the data and overfitting . Also, it is not clear that those complex models always provide a significant advantage in practical performance. However, this can reflect the small number of samples available instead of indicating an absence of complicated relationships between features . \n\nWe conducted a regression analysis to investigate the effect of the sample size on the results. Considering all the samples selected for the meta-analysis, we found worse results on both sensitivity and specificity by increasing the sample size. This same trend was also observed on specificities when considering only the SVM studies. \n\nHowever, using only the ANN studies, we could not find any significant effect. Since a great part of the ANN methods were also deep-learning methods and more complex models may demand larger samples to avoid overfitting, our analysis suggests that ANN techniques may have an advantage when dealing with larger samples. \n\n\n### Subjects characteristics \n  \nSeveral studies indicate gender, age, and IQ differences in autistic symptoms and impairments. For example, boys with ASD showed more restricted and repetitive behaviors than girls with ASD ; significant though modest effects of IQ and age indicated increased Autism severity with decreasing IQ and age ; also, lower socio-communicative symptoms were found in older compared to younger individuals . \n\nIt is well known that ASD shows an imbalanced male\u2013female ratio, and recent studies suggest values between 2:1 and 5:1 . There is also evidence that this ratio is lower in individuals with lower IQ . Since most autism studies tend to follow this ratio or include only male participants, the underrepresentation of females may have led to an understanding of the disorder biased toward males . Females are generally diagnosed later, and even with similar levels of severity of autistic traits, males are more likely to receive a diagnosis . \n\nStill, early detection and treatment would enormously benefit the individuals within the spectrum . Therefore, it is essential to understand how those variables may affect classification accuracy to obtain a clinically useful ML diagnostic tool. In our analysis, we could not find any significant effect of the sex of the subjects or their FIQ on sensitivities or specificities. However, we must highlight some issues. \n\nThe regression considering the sex of the subjects compared the articles that used only male subjects with the ones without a sex restriction\u2014whose samples were composed of males and females. Also, there were ten times fewer samples in the former compared to the latter subgroup. From the articles selected in the systematic review, only two  performed tests considering different categories of gender. They obtained higher classification accuracies for females than males, even though the number of training samples for females was significantly lower. \n\nRegarding the FIQ, we performed tests considering the mean FIQ and compared the samples composed of high-functioning subjects against those with both high- and low-functioning subjects. However, only 20% and 40% of the studies were included on those tests, respectively. \n\nRegression with the mean age of the subjects did not affect sensitivity or specificity, but less than half of the articles presented enough information to be included in this analysis. On the other hand, analysis considering an adulthood threshold indicated higher specificity in studies that used only subjects under 18 y.o. when compared to studies without this restriction. This result is in accordance with some of the selected studies , in which the adulthood segregation of the sample improved classification performance. However, the effect observed did not survive multiple comparisons, and the same analysis using only the SVM studies showed no significant effects (although it included almost three times fewer samples). \n\nAnalyzing the ABIDE\u2014the most used database\u2014we found a low proportion of child subjects: the ABIDE\u00a0I do not include individuals below 7 years old whereas ABIDE\u00a0II do not include individuals below 5 years old; in addition, from an analysis of the subjects that were available in both databases, less than 20% were below 10 years old (about 100 subjects in each one). The lack of younger individuals in those studies raises some questions. Those classifiers may be, in fact, detecting the consequences in terms of brain circuitry alterations of living with ASD instead of identifying the true roots of the disorder . \n\nAs we can see, there is a lack of information regarding the characteristics of the subjects and samples included in many of the studies. Aggravating the problem, variables such as IQ, symptom severity, and handedness are missing for some sites of ABIDE . \n\n\n### Sources of the samples \n  \nAs a heterogeneous and complex disorder, any ASD cohort is likely composed of ill-understood subtypes with different brain features. The use of large samples, such as provided by the ABIDE, can be helpful to address those issues . Studies based on smaller datasets from a single site are composed of more homogeneous participants, reducing the generalizability of those models. Therefore, large multi-site datasets are needed to include a greater diversity of participants and obtain more reliable, robust diagnostic systems that generalize better to new data, revealing common features that contribute to classification . \n\nOn the other hand, the massive use of a single database, as we saw in this study with ABIDE, end up limiting the interpretation and generalization of the analyses and results obtained. \n\nWe conducted analyses comparing the different versions of ABIDE used throughout the studies. At first, we found a significant effect on sensitivities, but this effect was not present in the sensitivity analysis or considering only the SVM studies. It is noteworthy that the ABIDE without version group is composed of samples from the ABIDE\u00a0I, ABIDE\u00a0I preprocessed, or ABIDE\u00a0II, but the studies did not specify which version they were using. \n\nWhen comparing the studies that used any version of ABIDE (121 samples) with studies that used databases or samples other than ABIDE (9 samples), the analysis indicated higher sensitivity and specificity in the studies of the first subgroup. This may reflect the greater size and diversity of the ABIDE compared to the other sources. However, the effect did not survive multiple comparisons, and we highlight the imbalance between those subgroups. \n\nIt is also vital to notice that, while most individuals with ASD live in low- and middle-income countries , all of the samples used in this meta-analysis were from high-income countries, and only one of them was not from North America or Europe. \n\nTherefore, it is of utmost importance that more diverse datasets and studies be created and conducted. The applicability of the results obtained so far needs to be tested and confirmed across different cultures and social classes. Also, larger and more diverse samples would allow studies using restricted samples (such as low-motion data or samples composed entirely of female subjects) to obtain more reliable and robust results by selecting a bigger number of participants. \n\n\n### Features definition \n  \nEven though the focus of our research was the ML diagnostic tools that used rs-fMRI for classification, some of the selected studies used other types of data together with rs-fMRI aiming to obtain better results by complementing the information available. In general, we found two types of complementary data: phenotypic information such as age and sex; other brain imaging data, specially sMRI. As there were not enough articles in each of these subgroups, we compared the studies that used only rs-fMRI data with those that used any other type of data together with rs-fMRI. Our results indicated a higher specificity in the latter case. \n\nDifferent brain images provide different views of the same brain and may reveal hidden evidence of ASD that is not available by using a single imaging modality . However, we must highlight that investigation of the effect of combining different types of data in the classification is not the main objective of this study. \n\nMost of the studies defined ROIs using a priori atlases. However, those atlases are often selected arbitrarily in the rs-fMRI community . Therefore, we conducted a subgroup analysis with the atlas used as moderator. \n\nBoth versions of the AAL obtained significantly better results than the CC200, but there was no significant difference between them. The sensitivity analysis, however, indicated better sensitivity for studies using the AAL116. We must also highlight that, in both cases, the p-values of the comparison between the versions of the AAL were close to the threshold of 0.05, and those results should be taken with extra caution. \n\nWe made a regression analysis considering the number of ROIs used throughout the studies. Our results indicated smaller accuracies as the number of regions used increased\u2014more specifically, worse sensitivities for the SVM studies and worse specificities for the ANN studies. This may be because more ROIs generally result in more features available. Using a large number of features relative to the number of data samples can cause classifiers to overfit . However, the effect did not survive multiple comparisons. \n\nThe variety of choices in data processing adds to the variability of the results obtained in the studies of the field . Therefore, we conducted a subgroup analysis considering the type of feature used. Our results indicated a significant advantage on sensitivity and specificity to the studies using the Fisher-transformed version of the PC against the studies using it without modifications. The studies using other features showed the same benefit against the PC ones (although not surviving multiple comparisons). Finally, even though the studies using the PC Fisher-transformed obtained better summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity, their comparison against the studies using other features did not indicate any significant effect\u2014which is not a surprise considering the great variety in the latter group. \n\n\n### QUADAS-2 analyses \n  \nBias and variation are often present in diagnostic test accuracy studies. Therefore, they need to be detected and assessed to understand the validity of the meta-analytic results obtained . Through QUADAS-2 application (see Fig.  ), we found many studies with high RoB on the patient selection domain, basically due to the selection of subjects in restricted intervals of age and IQ or the exclusion of female subjects. The effect of those variables on the classification results was already discussed in \u201c \u201d section. \n\nBeyond that, we can see that many studies were assessed to have an unclear RoB, especially on the patient selection and flow and timing domains. This reinforces the necessity to present more detailed information regarding the characteristics of the subjects and samples included in the publications. \n\nWe conducted some analysis using the QUADAS-2 results. The first one considered the number of domains with low RoB in each study and indicated higher specificity in studies with only one low RoB domain. We also performed a subgroup analysis using the index test domain results. As expected, studies with high or unclear RoB obtained significantly better results than studies with low RoB. We also found better outcomes for the studies with unclear RoB in comparison to those with high RoB. We suppose that a significant part of those studies assessed as unclear should have been assessed as high, but there was not enough information to conclude that. This also indicates a bias of overestimation\u2014at least for the specificities\u2014on the studies that do not apply their best models to independent sets after testing different numbers of features or atlases. \n\nFor the last analysis, we separated the low RoB category into the articles that performed a temporal or geographic validation and those using a split-sample validation . Even though the latter obtained better summary estimates than the former, there was no significant effect between their sensitivities or specificities. \n\nFrom the clinical standpoint, complete external validation (temporal or geographic) is preferred. Split-sample validation would not accurately assess the generalizability of a model. In contrast, geographic validation is helpful for this purpose since it may be performed with different technical parameters at different sites . Our analysis did not indicate a significant difference between the results using each of these types of validation. However, we must highlight that only 5 articles with low RoB by the index test domain performed a complete external validation, and it is still the more reliable approach to assess generalizability. \n\n\n### Clinical validity \n  \nAt present, ASD diagnosis is based on behavioral criteria, being vulnerable to subjectivity and interpretative bias. Also, less experienced clinicians seem to have more problems with the challenges of this complex diagnostic process . \n\nThe diagnostic utility and discriminative ability of the ADOS-G and the ADI-R were assessed using a clinical population of children . The results indicated approximately 75% of agreement with the qualified multidisciplinary team diagnoses, and most inconsistencies were false positives. The accuracy and validity of the ADOS-2 and ADI-R in diagnosing ASD in adults without an intellectual disability were also evaluated . The original algorithm of ADOS-2 Module 4 obtained 85.9% and 82.9%, whereas its revised algorithm obtained 87.2% and 74.3% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. On the other hand, the ADI-R got 43.1% of sensitivity and 94.7% of specificity. \n\nConsidering all the studies selected for the meta-analysis, we found summary sensitivity and specificity of 73.8% and 74.8%, respectively, for the ASD diagnosis using rs-fMRI and ML classifiers. Also, the AUC\/pAUC of 0.803\/0.765 indicates values between acceptable and excellent  (0.5: no discrimination; 0.7\u20130.79: acceptable; 0.8\u20130.89: excellent;   0.9 outstanding). If we look at the analysis considering only the SVM studies, those results were even better, with sensitivity and specificity above 76% and AUC of 0.832. Also, we found acceptable AUC values within the articles that presented lower RoB and, therefore, more reliable results. \n\nEven though these results seem promising and somewhat close to the ones obtained with diagnostic tools currently used for ASD, there is a long journey ahead before those ML algorithms could be used in clinical practice. First of all, the limitation found in the literature regarding the almost exclusive use of ABIDE as a source of samples also limit the interpretability of the quantitative results in this meta-analysis. \n\nBeyond that, the articles included in our analysis presented a great variety of features extracted and selected, classifiers used, and validation approaches applied. Thus, the summary estimates that we obtained show the overall potential of those procedures but do not indicate a specific one to be used in clinical practice. It would even be possible to use different classifiers for subjects with different characteristics\u2014such as sex and age\u2014similarly to what happens with the modules of ADOS-2. \n\nTaking the variety of neurodevelopmental etiologies believed to exist within the ASD population, there may not be an exceptional biomarker to diagnose the disorder . Perhaps the classifiers must consider different biomarkers for different etiologies, partitioning the ASD into more than a single class . \n\nThe decision on ASD diagnosis concerns the relationship established by the individual with their environment, which can lead to significant barriers to their quality of life and not to a specific condition in itself . Therefore, a binary classifier of ASD vs. non-ASD might not be clinically helpful by not considering the environmental factors or other similarly presenting conditions. Still, the margin of doubt regarding the impairment on quality of life is limited to milder ranges of the disorder, reducing the probability that the individual does not meet the diagnostic criteria as the autistic traits accumulate. Suppose these classifiers reliably demonstrate their consistency with formal clinical diagnostic. In that case, we could take advantage of these more efficient and possibly more disseminated and democratic tools to build a scenario of access to diagnosis to all those who need the resulting social support. \n\nAnother issue to consider is the difficulty of many children and low-functioning individuals with ASD to tolerate fMRI scans, which may explain their underrepresentation within the samples analyzed. However, the application of fMRI during natural sleep can help to overcome this limitation . The only article in this review that used subjects below five years of age  applied this methodology to obtain data from 6-month-old infants, with classification results above 80%. \n\nMany questions need to be assessed to define the clinical validity of those procedures. It includes the underrepresentation of females in research and clinical practice, the effects of subject\u2019s IQ and age, the lack of such information in many studies, and the necessity of larger and more diverse samples to confirm the generalizability of the classification tools. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSome limitations must be considered. The biggest one is the sample overlap between the studies, especially considering the lack of information on the patient selection process and the large number of studies that used the ABIDE database. Sample overlap induces a correlation structure among empirical outcomes, which, if not accounted for, can harm the statistical properties of meta-analysis methods and result in higher rates of false positives . Thus, it is not clear to which extent this overlap could bias the results obtained. Furthermore, due to the tremendous heterogeneity of ASD, this high degree of overlap may limit the interpretability and generalizability of our analysis. \n\nDespite that, we highlight that all the significant results obtained in our analyses were reasonable and in line with the literature, as we discussed in the previous subsections. Also, we clearly stated this limitation throughout the study and hope that it serves as a guide to future works, eventually reaching a state where more robust analyses can be done. \n\nConsidering the significant heterogeneity within the selected publications, the summary estimates obtained through the meta-analysis have to be interpreted with caution and in light of the methodologic quality of the studies, as previously discussed. Most studies provided only limited information regarding the patients samples and their clinical characteristics. However, detailed information about the participants\u2019 disease status, symptoms, current medication, history of interventions, or comorbidities is crucial for evaluating the potential of the proposed models to be applied in clinical practice . Thus, the impact of those variables on classification accuracy needs to be better investigated. \n\nThe studies included in our analysis identified ASD-distinctive brain patterns as compared to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, it is critical to investigate the patterns of brain abnormalities that differentiate between different psychiatric disorders. Also, the results obtained in this meta-analysis do not apply to individuals below five years of age since almost none of the studies included individuals with such low age. \n\nIn addition, some methodological steps were not investigated in our analyses, such as the data preprocessing and feature selection procedures. Those aspects still need to be assessed to define their effects on classification accuracy. \n\n\n### Recommendations \n  \nBased on our results, we recommend that future studies obtain their features using the PC Fisher-transformed instead of using it without modifications. Also, the AAL116 seems to be a good choice of atlas, and we encourage studies to explore other types of data to complement rs-fMRI. \n\nIn the face of large samples, ANN techniques seem to have an advantage compared to SVM. However, considering the limitations of our study and the other methods not analyzed, we think it is a bit premature to recommend any of these techniques. For example, two articles  using RF obtained results around 90%, and it would be interesting to include this technique in future analyses. \n\nIt would be of great value for future publications in this field to apply the following best practices, when possible: report, at least, measures of sensitivity and specificity; present detailed information of the subjects and samples used (sex, age, IQ, number of TD and ASD subjects, etc.); inform the reference standard used and how the patients were selected, even if the sample came from an existing database; after conducting all the tests, apply the best model to an independent sample, preferably using a temporal or geographic validation; use more diverse samples, especially from low- and middle-income countries; if the samples came from an existing database, specify which subjects were included. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive analysis on the literature of ML classifiers using rs-fMRI data for ASD diagnosis, indicating promising pathways and questions to be addressed. Our results showed overall sensitivity and specificity estimates of around 75%. We found better accuracy for SVM classifiers, but ANN techniques may have an advantage in dealing with larger samples. Also, the use of other types of data to complement rs-fMRI information seems to be promising. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis focused on the topic, and we reiterate the availability of all extracted data. However, given the many limitations indicated in our study and the poor methodological quality found in a great part of the selected articles, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of those classification algorithms to clinical settings, and the quantitative meta-analytical results presented here should be taken with caution. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nThe articles used in this review were found through four digital libraries: Scopus, El Compendex, PubMed\u2014NCBI, and IEEE Xplore. Considering that the El Compendex and PubMed NCBI libraries resulted in many duplicated articles (approximately 73% and 91% of the articles, respectively), we decided not to include other libraries in the search and find out more studies through the snowballing. \n\nThe search expression was iteratively defined using keywords considered appropriate. We analyzed the titles and abstracts of the publications found through the searches to determine whether they were related or not to the purpose of this study. Based on that, we refined the search expression and obtained the final version presented below: \n\nWe started using other expressions related to ASD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV)  to possibly include articles published before 2013\u2014when the DSM-V  was first published. These expressions were: \u201cPervasive Development Disorders\u201d; \u201cPDD\u201d; \u201cAutistic Disorder\u201d; \u201cAsperger\u2019s Disorder\u201d; \u201cAsperger\u201d; \u201cChildhood Disintegrative Disorder\u201d; \u201cPDD-NOS\u201d. However, the addition of these terms only resulted in two new articles that were not related to the purpose of this study. Therefore, we decided to simplify the expression by removing those terms. \n\nThe search was carried out in two parts. First, we searched for articles published between January 1, 2010, and December 7, 2018, the date of the last search conducted. The string was applied directly in the digital libraries El Compendex and PubMed. The advanced mode was used for Scopus, and the search was specified for title, abstract, and keywords. Likewise, the advanced mode was used for IEEE Xplore, but the search was specified for full text. The start date was defined considering that, during the tests with the string, only one article published before 2010 was found, and it did not fulfill the criteria to be included in this study. Furthermore, the use of the snowballing technique should retrieve the most relevant papers published before this date. \n\nAfter the first search, the development of the study took longer than expected. Therefore, a second search was performed to keep the study updated. We searched for articles published between December 7, 2018, and April 3, 2020, the last search date. The string was applied to the digital libraries using the same process as in the first search. The only exception was the IEEE Xplore, for which we used the command search instead of the advanced mode, and the search was specified for full text and metadata. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nFirst, a triage process was applied to the non-duplicate publications. Three authors (C.P.S., E.A.C., I.D.R.) submitted each paper to a selection based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria previously defined (see Supplementary Table  ). However, some exclusion criteria needed to be created or adjusted during the selection for better classification. \n\nGenerally speaking, we included publications that used ML techniques to classify subjects between ASD and TD based only on rs-fMRI or based on rs-fMRI together with other types of data. Guidelines for applying ML techniques in the classification of brain images were included if they presented classification results regarding rs-fMRI and ASD. Also, publications focused on distinguishing ASD from other disorders were included if they classified ASD vs. TD. \n\nThe criteria were applied based on the abstracts of the studies. When it was not sufficient, a superficial reading of the entire article was carried out\u2014it is worth noting that this was conducted only for a pre-selection of the articles. The papers were selected if at least one of the researchers concluded it should be. Then, the same three researchers performed a new assessment to confirm the selection. In this step, each paper selected was read carefully to determine if it fulfilled three requirements: (1) used rs-fMRI data; (2) performed a classification between ASD and TD; (3) the classification was performed using an ML technique. If at least one of those requirements was not fulfilled, the article was excluded from the study. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThree authors (C.P.S., E.A.C., I.D.R.) used a standardized data extraction sheet to collect data from all included studies (see Supplementary Table   online). We extracted the source and type of the data, sample size, if the study included both males and females, average age and FIQ of the subjects, preprocessing steps, feature extraction and selection procedures, the validation process, classifiers used, outcomes reported, main results (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and measures of TP, TN, FP, and FN), other tests performed, and important brain areas. \n\nWe extracted\/calculated only one result from each independent sample in a study. Since the majority of the publications presented multiple results from different tests, the main results were selected according to the following criteria: results from the classification method proposed in the article were prioritized; results presenting enough information to conduct the meta-analysis (measures of TP, TN, FP, and FN, number of ASD and TD subjects in the test set) were prioritized; results using only rs-fMRI data were prioritized; results using a hold-out test set, an inter-site (leave-one-site-out) approach or a train\/validation\/test procedure were prioritized; tests using larger samples were prioritized; if the study presented results using different numbers of folds for the cross-validation, tenfold was prioritized (the most common approach); finally, the results with higher accuracy were prioritized. \n\n\n### Snowballing \n  \nSnowballing means systematically searching for primary studies based on references to and from other studies. Since we limited our research to the date of the last search conducted, we only performed a backward snowballing . The goal was to broaden the scope of this work and include the maximum number of related articles, especially those before 2010, if any. \n\nAs the selected articles were analyzed, we looked for references that could be included in this systematic review according to the inclusion\/exclusion criteria. It resulted in many duplicated articles, so we decided not to re-apply the snowballing technique. Also, the new articles found went through the same selection process presented before. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nOne author (C.P.S.) assessed methodological quality using the QUADAS-2 \u2014the currently recommended tool for a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies . \n\nQUADAS-2 assesses study quality in four key domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. All the domains are assessed in terms of RoB, and the first three are also evaluated in terms of concerns about applicability (the concern that a study does not match the review question) . \n\nThe tool was tailored by two authors (C.P.S., E.A.C.). After defining the signaling questions and review-specific guidance, both authors applied the tool using five articles. The answers to the signaling questions and the risks of bias\/applicability were compared, and any disagreement was discussed to reach a consensus. We maintained the core signaling questions for each domain as defined by the QUADAS-2  except for the index test domain, for which we defined the level of RoB by reviewing the validation process used to obtain the classification accuracy. \n\nStudies using a nested cross-validation procedure or a hold-out set for testing the proposed classification algorithms were assessed as having low RoB. If a study presented their results per number of features, per atlas used or similar, but the best model was not applied to an independent set, there was a high RoB. Studies using a cross-validation scheme without providing any further information were considered as having an unclear RoB. The applicability concerns of the same domain were based on the type of data used. Studies using other data types beyond rs-fMRI were assessed as having high concerns unless the data used would be available in a real application (e.g., age or gender). \n\nThe QUADAS-2 tool was applied two times. In the first, all articles were assessed as a whole. In the second, only the papers selected for the meta-analysis were evaluated, considering the main results (as defined in \u201c \u201d section) used for the statistical analysis. In both cases, the information used to reach the judgment of each of the domains was recorded to make the rating transparent and facilitate discussion. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStudies were eligible for inclusion in the quantitative meta-analysis if TP, TN, FP, and FN measures were available or if the data allowed for their calculation. Therefore, we excluded studies that: did not report sensitivity\/specificity (nor equivalent metrics); did not present enough information regarding the number of TD and ASD subjects on the test set. We also chose not to include articles with results reported only through bar charts nor RF studies without enough information on their OOB results (see \u201c \u201d section for more details). However, those three articles were included in a sensitivity analysis. The TP\/TN\/FP\/FN values were extracted or calculated from each independent sample in a study according to the criteria defined in \u201c \u201d section. \n\nTo avoid bias, handling sample overlap between the studies is necessary, possibly excluding samples with considerable overlap. However, the majority of the studies selected in this review extracted their samples from the ABIDE database. Thereby, we have a lot of potential overlapping samples. At the same time, there is little information concerning the exact individuals used in each study to conclude the real extent of the overlap. Excluding all the potential overlapping samples would make it difficult to perform a meta-analysis since only a few results would remain. Furthermore, we can consider that the studies vary considerably regarding characteristics such as the preprocessing, features, and classification techniques used. Thus,this overlap could not be accounted for and we decided to use all the results regardless of it. \n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using the open-source package mada  version 0.5.10 in R Statistics  version 4.1.1. A coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity was created using RevMan version 5.3 . SROC curves, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, and the corresponding 95% CIs were calculated by the bivariate model of Reitsma et al. . Prediction region, AUC, and pAUC were also obtained. Studies that were visually deviant from the 95% prediction region on the SROC curves were considered heterogeneous . \n\nSubgroup analysis and bivariate meta-regression with potential covariables were performed to reduce any heterogeneity noted between the studies. The ML technique used, year of publication, sample size, type of data, source of the sample, atlas used, number of ROIs, QUADAS-2 results, type of features, and sex, IQ, and age of the subjects were investigated. Knowing that the bivariate model has five parameters , we considered   the minimum number of studies to justify a separate meta-analysis. All tests were based on a 2-sided significance level of  . \n\nSince we conducted many tests of significance, we applied the Bonferroni correction  to account for multiple comparisons. We considered different corrections for different families of tests . Therefore, for subgroup analysis (30 tests) the corrected significance level is   while for meta-regression (13 tests) the corrected significance level is  . \n\nIn sensitivity analysis, three studies that were initially excluded from the meta-analysis were included to verify the robustness of the results. Also, we investigated the effect of the age of the subjects considering different adulthood thresholds (18\u201321 years old). \n\nPublication bias was not assessed in our analysis, as there are currently no statistically adequate models in the field of meta-analysis of DTA studies, and further research is required . \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9001715,"text_md5":"1b4760bb0a7da06ef192ea41799dd596","field_positions":{"authors":[0,164],"journal":[165,172],"publication_year":[174,178],"title":[189,274],"keywords":[288,363],"abstract":[376,1894],"body":[1903,67410]},"batch":1,"pmid":35411059,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-022-09821-6","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9001715","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9001715"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9001715\">9001715<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9001715  rs-fMRI and machine learning for ASD diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Methods: We searched Web of Science Core Collection and other databases with the keywords related to social anxiety, social phobia, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for comparing persons with SAD to healthy controls and used the activation likelihood estimation method. Thirty-seven papers met the inclusion criteria, including 15 with emotional faces as stimuli, 8 presenting specific situations as stimuli, and 14 using other types of tasks as stimuli. Among these papers, 654 participants were in the SAD group and 594 participants were in the control group with 335 activation increase points and 115 activation decrease points. Results: Whole-brain analysis showed that compared with healthy controls, persons with SAD showed significantly lower activation of the left anterior cingulate gyrus (MNI coordinate: x = \u22126, y = 22, z = 38;   p   0.001). Sub-group analysis based on task indicated that when performing tasks with emotional faces as stimuli, persons with SAD showed significantly lower activation of the left cerebellar slope and fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinate: x = \u221226, y = \u221268, z = \u221212;   p   0.001), and significantly higher activation of the right supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus, than healthy controls (MNI coordinate: x = 58, y = \u221252, z = 30;   p   0.001). Conclusion: Individuals with social anxiety disorder show abnormal activation in the cingulate gyrus, which is responsible for the process of attention control, and task type can influence the activation pattern. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD; previously called social phobia) has been defined as the experience of constant fear, nervousness, and avoidance in the presence of a stranger, or in social situations that involve being observed [ ]. Previous studies found that social anxiety often begins in adolescence and, if left untreated, can lead to comorbidity with depression, substance abuse, and other anxiety disorders [ ]. More and more researchers are using neuroimaging technology (especially magnetic resonance imaging technology) to explore the cognitive neural mechanism of SAD. This basic research may one day have applied value in the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder.  \n\nHowever, not all these studies have obtained concordant conclusions. First, there is no consensus on which brain regions are related to SAD. Some researchers believed that a large-scale system of neural activity should be concerned in the diagnosis of SAD, while others considered that some distinct brain regions (e.g., right amygdala and superior temporal sulcus) are related to SAD [ , ]. Besides, researchers have no agreement on how the activities of brain regions change in SAD. For example, Gentili et al. found that the activity of the left fusiform gyrus of individuals with social phobia was significantly increased in their research, however, Frick et al. derived the opposite conclusion in their study, in which the activity of the bilateral fusiform gyrus of individuals with SAD significantly increased [ , ]. A possible explanation for inconsistent conclusions could be that there are different experimental paradigms in these studies. In previous task-state fMRI studies of SAD, researchers mostly used emotional face stimuli, social context stimuli, memory tasks, emotional Stroop tasks, and speech tasks to explore the relationships between activation of different brain structures and SAD. The results of these studies appear to differ based on task. For example, in one study using a speech task, activation of the pons, ventral striatum, amygdala, insula, and temporal polar regions of persons with SAD increased significantly, while the activations of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex decreased significantly [ ].  \n\nThere have been four meta-analyses that included results regarding the relation between brain activation and SAD. Etkin et al. published the first meta-analysis of neuroimaging results in samples of participants with anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, SAD, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and comorbid pain disorder. They concluded that there may be a general \u201cfear circuit\u201d centered in the amygdala and the insula, and abnormal activities in these brain regions may cause SAD [ ]. Later, in 1999, Hattingh et al. published a meta-analysis exploring the affective cognition ability of persons with SAD and found that the average activations of the amygdala, temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, globus pallidus, and posterior central gyrus in SAD groups were significantly lower than those in control groups [ ]. Gentili et al. studied the face perception ability of patients with SAD and found that the face stimulation task led to increased activations of the amygdala, globus pallidus, superior temporal sulcus, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex of patients with SAD [ ]. Binelli et al. found abnormal activation of the limbic system in patients with SAD [ ].  \n\nAlthough these meta-analyses found associations between SAD and abnormalities in certain brain regions, as a group they had limitations. Each included only seven or eight articles. They also used inconsistent methods of data analysis (some used analysis of region of interest (ROI)), the literature searches were not comprehensive, and a focus on the experimental tasks that assess the processing of emotional faces but not memory tasks, speech tasks, and situation presentations. These inconsistent results and limitations of previous studies and meta-analysis indicate that more comprehensive meta-analyses using innovative methods need to be taken to further clarify the cognitive neural mechanism of SAD. Therefore, in the current meta-analysis, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature and used Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) rather than ROI to explore whole-brain activation in samples of persons with SAD when performing a range of tasks. By comparing differences in brain activation under different task paradigms within one meta-analysis, we can gain further understanding of the neural mechanism of SAD.  \n\nOverall, the purpose of the present study was to explore the cognitive and neural mechanism of SAD from a whole-brain view and further compare differences in brain activation under different task paradigms. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Study Selection \n  \nWe searched databases such as Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and CNKI with the combination of keywords (\u201csocial anxiety\u201d or \u201csocial phobia\u201d) and (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d). For the PubMed, MeSH terms were utilized. In addition, we conducted a manual search of the reference lists of papers on related topics. Reviews, meta-analyses, and case studies were excluded, although studies cited in these papers were considered for inclusion. The criteria for inclusion were as follows: (a) persons with SAD or social phobia were compared to healthy controls; (b) the study reported the results of task-state brain imaging (with no limitation on task type); (c) the imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain data analysis; (d) the study reported between-group differences in brain activation and the coordinates of that activation; and (e) the paper was written in English or in Chinese. Accordingly, the exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) persons with neither SAD nor social phobia; (b) the study did not control with healthy subjects; (c) the study did not use fMRI as an imaging tool; (d) the study did not report the results of task-state brain imaging; (e) the study utilized ROI analysis; (f) the study did not report coordinate data; (g) the study did not demonstrate clear coordinate spaces; (h) the study did not report abnormal direction; and (i) the study was not an experimental study. The procedure was conducted strictly in accordance with PRISMA guidance. See   for the search process. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data Extraction \n  \nThe following data were extracted from each paper: (a) study ID, (b) author, (c) publication year, (d) age, (e) coordinates, (f) number of extracted coordinates (SAD groups healthy controls), (g) number of extracted coordinates (SAD groups healthy controls), (h) brain region, (i) gender, (j) task type, and (k) type of coordinates. Data extraction and coding were carried out by two authors independently. In order to ensure the reliability, two authors met regularly and resolved disagreements in coding and data extraction through discussion and consensus. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study Quality \n  \nThe quality and risk of bias (RoB) of included studies were evaluated with a modified version of the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa scale (mNOS), which adapted to fMRI data [ ]. This version uses a different set of items adapted to fMRI studies [ ]. Scores on the mNOS range from 0 to 11, with 0 to 3 considered indicative of high risk, 4 to 7 as intermediate, and 8 to 11 as low risk. RoB was independently assessed by two authors. Inter-rater agreement was measured with the Kappa statistic, and disagreements were subsequently resolved by discussion with a third author. \n\n\n### 2.4. ALE Meta-Analysis \n  \nActivation Likelihood Estimation(ALE) was utilized in the present study, which is a commonly used statistical method for meta-analysis in the field of neuroimaging. It uses the activation probability as an index and hypotheses concern this probability. The voxels of brain structures activated under certain conditions in each experiment included in the meta-analysis are analyzed together, and the probability of consistent activation reaching the set threshold can be calculated. In this study, meta-analyses were conducted four times in two main steps. Specifically, we conducted the overall analysis of all the data first, then the subgroup analysis (emotional face group and situational stimulus group) based on the classification of the experimental stimulus materials. The emotional faces group was the experimental paradigm with emotional faces as the stimulus material, and the situational stimulus group was the experimental paradigm with scene pictures as the stimulus material (see   for details). In this study, the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( , accessed on 16 May 2019) was used for the analysis. The process is based on the parameter setting recommendations in the GingerALE instruction manual: the statistically different coordinates in the literature were extracted and transformed into spatial coordinates; the family-wise error (FWE) algorithm was employed for statistical analysis (  p   0.001); finally, the corresponding statistical results and Figure were presented based on the Mango software program v4.1. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nThe search produced 1297 entries (23 after removal of duplicates), 1108 of which were excluded based on the abstract, because they were (a) not social anxiety disorder, or (b) did not use fMRI as an imaging tool; or (c) case studies. The remaining 166 articles were retrieved, and full texts of them were assessed. A total of 129 articles were excluded due to (a) not being task-state studies (  n   = 28); (b) did not control with healthy subjects (  n   = 42); (c) did not use fMRI as an imaging tool (  n   = 5); (d) were not a social anxiety disorder (  n   = 15); (e) had ROI analysis (  n   = 13); (f) did not report coordinate data (  n   = 17); (g) had unclear coordinate spaces (  n   = 2); (h) did not report abnormality direction (  n   = 5); (i) were not an experimental study (  n   = 1); (j) were a replicated study (  n   = 1). A total of 37 articles were included in the meta-analysis, as described in the PRISMA flow diagram (see  ).  \n\n\n### 3.2. Characteristics of the Included Studies \n  \nA total of 1297 publications were retrieved from initial search, among which 37 studies met the inclusion criteria (654 participants in the SAD groups and 594 participants in the control groups). There were 15 studies that adopted emotional faces as task stimuli [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ], 8 that presented specific situations as task stimuli [ , , , , , , , ], and the other 14 employed other types of tasks [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. In total, the coordinates where SAD groups performed significantly better or significantly worse than control groups were 335 and 115 respectively (see specific characteristics in  ). \n\n\n### 3.3. Study Quality \n  \nThe result showed that the overall Cohen kappa (mean \u00b1 SD) was 0.953 \u00b1 0.08 ranging from 1 to 0.73. Consensus and Cohen kappa for each item of the mNOS are reported in  . The lower agreement was for drop-out rate (0.78) and false positive correction (0.73). Twenty-six studies were considered as low RoB, eleven as intermediate risk, and none as high risk of bias. A detailed description of the quality of each study is presented in the  .  \n\n\n### 3.4. Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nThe whole-brain analysis showed that the activation of the left cingulate gyrus (MNI coordinates: x = \u22126, y = 22, z = 38) in SAD groups was significantly lower than that in control groups (maximum ALE value = 0.015). The results of sub-group analysis showed that in studies using tasks with emotional faces as stimuli, the activation of the left cerebellar slope (extending to the fusiform gyrus; MNI coordinates: x = \u221226, y = \u221268, z = 12) in the SAD groups was significantly lower than in the control groups (maximum ALE value = 0.015), and there were no clusters showing higher activation in the SAD groups. In tasks with specific situations as stimuli, the brain area with significantly lower activation in the SAD groups was the upper right marginal gyrus (extended to the angular gyrus; MNI coordinates: x = 58, y = \u221252, z = 30; maximum ALE value = 0.013). There were no other brain regions with significantly higher activation in the SAD groups (see   and   for details).  \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we used the ALE method to analyze brain functional imaging data of people with SAD and healthy controls. We found that the activation of the left anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellar slope and fusiform gyrus, right superior marginal gyrus, and angular gyrus were lower in SAD groups than in healthy control groups. In this section, we first discuss the abnormal activation of brain regions in the SAD groups, then discuss the influence of different experimental paradigms on the activation of brain regions in the SAD groups, and finally explain the advantages and limitations of this study. \n\n### 4.1. Anterior Cingulate Cortex \n  \nThe anterior cingulate gyrus belongs to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) group. It is an important structure of the limbic system and plays an important role in the generation and regulation of emotions. The cingulate gyrus is the main brain area that helps information from focused attention enter the conscious level, and its activation state has been confirmed in various experiments [ ]. For example, in simple and easy processing, the anterior cingulate gyrus is less able to cope with selective attention, and the posterior cingulate gyrus is less able to promote the execution of appropriate responses and\/or inhibit the execution of unsuitable responses. These weakening effects may result in a decline in the anti-interference ability of individuals with SAD, making them feel more anxious.  \n\nThe anterior cingulate gyrus is also an important connection node between the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. It plays an important role in perceiving and processing social rejection, and research on the activity of this structure provides evidence that social pain and physical pain share a common neurocognitive function [ ]. The anterior cingulate gyrus is also important in a person\u2019s coping with social stressors [ ]. For example, Wang et al. found that a reduction in the connection between the left anterior cuneate\/posterior cingulate and the gyrus-anterior cingulate gyrus in anxious patients will lead to weakened emotion regulation, and finally cause anxiety [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.2. Angular Gyrus\/Supramarginal Gyrus \n  \nThe meta-analysis found that the angular gyrus activity was significantly lower in individuals with SAD than in healthy controls when performing a situational stimulus task. The angular gyrus plays a very important role in mental constructs such as thoughts, feelings, and beliefs related to oneself and others [ ]. Qiu et al. reported that during the resting state without external stimuli, individuals with SAD had emotional and attentional deviations and distorted negative self-belief [ ]. The results of this study support previous researchers\u2019 conclusions that individuals who hold negative beliefs about themselves show abnormal angular gyrus activity [ ]. We also found that the activity of the upper right supramarginal gyrus of individuals with SAD was significantly lower than that of healthy controls in situational stimulus tasks. Previous studies reported that when individuals with SAD recognized their own faces, they also showed significant reductions of activity in the supramarginal gyrus. Therefore, some researchers believe that the cognitive bias of individuals with SAD when performing a situational stimulus task may be related to the cognitive distortion of their own faces [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.3. Cerebellar Slope\/Fusiform Gyrus \n  \nThis meta-analysis showed that the activation of the left cerebellar slope of individuals with SAD was significantly lower than that of the healthy controls when performing face recognition tasks. The cerebellum is an important part of the motor network, and structurally it is closely connected with the limbic system. It is also an important part of emotional processing [ ]. Previous studies found that the cerebellar area showed abnormal changes when individuals with SAD spoke in public, watched angry faces, performed confrontational computing tasks, and were exposed to different social tasks. The results of these previous studies are consistent with those of the current research [ ]. \n\nThe meta-analysis also showed that there was significantly lower activity of the fusiform gyrus in the SAD groups than in the healthy control groups during emotional faces tasks. This may indicate that the individuals with SAD adopted an avoidance strategy and reduced their fixation on emotional facial stimuli. The results of several previous studies support this finding. For example, Gentili et al. found that the activity of the left fusiform gyrus of individuals with social phobia was significantly reduced when watching emotional and neutral faces, compared with watching garbled pictures [ ]. However, other studies reported opposite results. For example, Frick et al. found that the activity of the bilateral fusiform gyrus of individuals with SAD significantly increased when they looked at scared faces [ ]. A reasonable explanation for this inconsistency is that the activity of the fusiform gyrus depends on whether individuals with SAD adopt avoidance strategies, but also on the type of research paradigm the study used. Future research could use eye tracking to test the hypothesis that individuals with SAD avoid looking at the emotional face, leading to reduced activity in the fusiform gyrus. \n\n\n### 4.4. Different Task Types Affect Activation Patterns in Brain Regions \n  \nIn the emotional face stimulation task, previous studies found abnormal activity in the limbic system of individuals with SAD [ ]. Specifically, compared to healthy controls, people with SAD showed significantly higher activity in the amygdala, sulcus, and the parahippocampal gyrus when viewing angry and contemptuous faces. The hippocampus\u2019 response to emotional faces is positively correlated with the severity of social anxiety symptoms [ ]. This meta-analysis excluded studies that only analyzed a specific brain region of interest and studies that did not report the coordinates of the brain regions showing abnormal activity. Using these exclusion criteria, we found a significant decrease in the activation of the left cerebellar slope, providing new insights for research in this field. That is, SAD may involve dysfunction of a wide range of neural networks, including the limbic system and cerebellum. \n\nIn the specific situational stimulus paradigm, the activation of the upper right supramarginal gyrus in the SAD groups was significantly lower than that of the control groups. The upper right supramarginal gyrus plays an important role in regulating empathy for others. When this area works abnormally, people are unable to make rapid judgments about other people\u2019s emotions and have difficulty feeling empathy. Dysfunction in this area can also lead to more self-centeredness because of high levels of cognition at the expense of emotion, known as intellectualization [ ]. Previous research found that people with SAD were not incapable of recognizing other people\u2019s emotions, but they still had low ability for empathy. One reason may be that they have problems with mentalization [ ]. Compared with emotional facial stimuli, certain situational stimuli may be more likely to create a sense of an interpersonal environment, which serves as an important condition for the creation of empathy [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.5. Advantages and Limitations of This Study \n  \nThis meta-analysis study adopted the ALE method and conducted whole-brain analysis and sub-group task analysis in studies comparing individuals with SAD to healthy controls. These methods make it likely that the results are more reliable than those reported in earlier meta-analyses in this literature. However, the present study also has some shortcomings. The first limitation is that the number of studies included in the analyses was relatively small. We had intended to compare the results from studies using a range of experimental tasks but found that most of the studies used either the situational stimulation task or the emotional face stimulation task, and the other studies could not be characterized as sharing a certain paradigm. We expect further relevant sub-group studies to stabilize the current results. Second, the meta-analysis method examines many different studies, which may reduce the homogeneity of the data and affect the stability of the research results. Third, because of the lack of behavioral data of some studies, we did not explore the relationship between behavioral data and activated brain regions by using regression analysis, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Finally, in this study, no functional abnormalities in other brain areas such as the amygdala were found, which may have resulted from the use of whole brain analysis. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nOverall, the present meta-analysis utilized a reliable method (i.e., ALE) to conduct whole-brain analysis, and found some brain activations were lower in SAD groups than in healthy control groups, which revealed the neurological mechanisms of the SAD groups. People with SAD mainly show abnormal activation in the cingulate gyrus, which is related to attention control. Besides, the present study also found that brain activations were different between experimental paradigms in the SAD groups, that is, task types can affect the activation pattern. This finding indicated that the results should be interpreted with caution due to the different experimental paradigms. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8196988,"text_md5":"b5d8c74cec85308370734542116552c4","field_positions":{"authors":[0,111],"journal":[112,143],"publication_year":[145,149],"title":[160,252],"keywords":[266,346],"abstract":[359,2104],"body":[2113,24081]},"batch":1,"pmid":34067468,"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph18115556","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8196988","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8196988"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8196988\">8196988<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8196988  Cognitive Neural Mechanism of Social Anxiety Disorder: A Meta-Analysis Based on fMRI Studies"}

Though controversial, Brinley plots can assess between-task differences, the impact of increasing task demand, and the relationship between responses in two groups of subjects. Since a relationship exists between response times and the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI), Brinley's plotting method could be applied as a meta-analysis tool in fMRI studies of aging. Here, fledgling \u201cPeiffer plots\u201d are discussed for their potential impact on understanding general cognitive brain activity in aging. Preliminary results suggest that general cognitive slowing may be localized at the sensorimotor transformation in the precentral gyrus. Although this meta-analysis method is naturally used with imaging studies of aging, theoretically it may be applied to other study pairs (e.g., schizophrenic versus normal) or imaging datasets (e.g., PET). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. INTRODUCTION \n  \nIn the mid 1960s, Brinley \npresented a novel plotting \nmethod to consider the\nrelationship between response times in young and older \nadults across a variety\nof tasks with varying levels of cognitive difficulty \n[ ]. The average response times\nfor both the young and older groups of adults on each task was \nplaced on a\nscatter-plot, and a regression line was then fitted to the \ndata using the\noperation of  . \nIn doing so, a relationship was \nrealized between the\nbehavior in young adults and its ability to predict behavior \non the same task\nin older adults. The power of this method of data analysis is \nthat it can be\nused across task types to pool data from multiple studies. \nHere we harvest the\npowerful aspects of the Brinley analysis method and apply \nthem to functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Meta-analyses of \nfMRI data are\ntypically hindered by differences in the types of tasks \nused across studies.\nThe use of the Brinley method allows for a \nmeta-analysis of fMRI data that\nactually takes advantage of multiple cognitive tasks. \nHowever, the remaining\nchallenge is to carefully interpret the findings. \n\nThe history of Brinley plots is rife with \ndebate and discussion on what the plot is measuring\nand what it means. Feelings in opposing camps can \neven be so strong as to\nelicit T-shirts emblazoned with the No symbol over \nthe word Brinley. Later\nresearchers inferred that aspects of Brinley plots \ncould provide information on\ngeneral cognitive functioning in older adults since \nBrinley's data contained\nboth task switching and nonswitching data subsets \n[ \u2013 ]. For example, if the slope\nfor the fitted line of a group of tasks is 1, then there is \nequal change between tasks for younger and older adults. \nHowever, when the slope of the\nfitted line deviates and is greater than 1, there is \nan increased slowing in\nolder adults associated with more cognitively demanding tasks \n(i.e., a general cognitive slowing deficit is evident in \nolder adults regardless of task [e.g., \n[ ]]). Other researchers have\ndisagreed with this Brinley plot interpretation and suggest \nthat the plot\nreflects a difference in response variability \nbetween the age groups rather\nthan processing speed, per se \n[ ]. \nFinally, current work in how\naging affects processing speed questions the degree \nto which general cognitive\nslowing can be summarized with one linear \nfunction across all types of tasks \n[ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn addition to describing the behavioral appearance \nof cognitive slowing, research\nhas pursued localizing the phenomenon within the \naging brain. Generalized\ncognitive slowing has been thought to \nresult from pervasive slowing of all\ncognitive brain functions in older adults. \nWith this in mind, some researchers\nhave proposed that the locus of general \ncognitive slowing occurs where sensory\nimpulses transfer to a common site of motor \ngeneration for the response and\nthat this sensorimotor dysregulation intensifies \nwith more difficult tasks [ \u2013 ]. Yordanova and colleagues\nfound evidence to support this hypothesis using event-related \npotentials, which\nare able to evaluate the timing and strength \nof cognitive processing in\nresponse to external stimuli \n[ ]. However, when considering\ntask-specific slowing impact, other researchers point to \nadditional slowing in\nspecific cognitive areas such as working memory, \nvisual search and mental\nrotation [ , \n ], \nwhich may occur in addition to\nor instead of the sensorimotor slowing. \n\nAfter reviewing the body of research literature \non general cognitive slowing in\naging, we adopted the early Brinley method \nfor plotting reaction times and\napplied it to the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) \nsignal from multiple fMRI\nstudies. In doing so, an attempt is made to localize \nbrain areas responsible\nfor the deviant slope in the response time Brinley plot. \nUnlike reaction times,\nthe BOLD signal has a \nlegitimate negative value\n(i.e., deactivations) that occurs when contrasting activity \nduring two different events. For example, \ncertain brain areas are more active during\nbaseline than during any particular task. \nThese areas prominently include\nposterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobe \nareas and are known as\nthe default network [ ]. \nIn applying Brinley's\nplotting method on the BOLD signal, we are able to construct \nnovel Peiffer\nplots, a meta-analysis of fMRI data that is not limited to \nsite locations of\nactivation maxima and thus not skewed to evaluate only areas \nidentified as\nstatistically different within a study \n[see discussion in [ ]]. \nTypical meta-analyses of\nfMRI data use location-centered approaches \nwhere the focus of peak activity is\nevaluated [ \u2013 ]. This can underestimate\nbetween-task differences because subthreshold \nactivity differences are\noverlooked [see discussion in [ ]]. \nFurther, differences in task\nparameters and paradigm domain limit the tasks \ncompared in many fMRI\nmeta-analyses to a single type of task \n(e.g., Stroop interference task \n[ , \n ]). \nWith the novel method\nproposed here, a plot can be made across a \nvariety of fMRI studies to evaluate\ntwo different population groups to identify areas \nshowing between-task\ndifferences that may not necessarily be identified as \ndeviant within an\nindividual study comparison. Lastly, in using this method to \ncompare young and\nolder adults, we may be able to show localization of the areas \nthat may in fact\nidentify differences in age-related information \nprocessing that characterize\ngeneral cognitive slowing. \n\n\n## 2. METHODS \n  \nBOLD data and behavioral response times were obtained from 4 simple \ndetection tasks (3 visual and 1 auditory). In order to plot a BOLD signal value \nfor young and older adults in each study, original fMRI data was needed. \nThe fMRI Data Center ( ) contributed a complete dataset from Buckner and colleagues \n(Accession no. 2-2000-1118W) for 2 points in\nthe analysis (young = 14; older adults = 14) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements related to responses associated with the \npresentation of a single\nor double flashing checkerboard. The other 2 points were \nfrom studies performed\nin our laboratory (young = 20; older adults = 20) \n[ ]. These BOLD signal\nmeasurements were related to block activity during an \nauditory task where\nsubjects needed to respond when they heard a target tone or \nin a visual task\nwhere they responded to the blurring of a flashing checkerboard. \nFor all points\nin the meta-analysis, all fMRI comparisons were between \ntask and baseline\n(i.e., fixation cross) and were preprocessed with global \nsignal correction. Further,\nduring the preprocessing of the data, \nit is spatially normalized to MNI\ntemplate space. Normalized task specific \n\u201ccon\u201d images reflecting the\ntask-related BOLD activity change from baseline \nwere computed with SPM99 for\nall individuals in each dataset. These individual \n\u201ccon\u201d images were then\naveraged within age group for each study resulting in a \ntotal of 8 average BOLD\nactivity maps (2 age groups over 4 tasks). \nThis process emulated the\nconstruction of a traditional Brinley plot which averaged \nthe response times\nfor each task within each age group. \nWithin the BOLD average signal maps, each\nvoxel contains a value representing the age \ngroup's average BOLD activity for\nthat task at that standardized MNI   \ncoordinate. \n\nUsing the 4 average young maps as observed  -values and\nthe corresponding 4 average older adult maps as observed \n -values, a linear\nregression analysis   was calculated \nwithin each voxel that contained\nat least 3   data points (see   for \na representative voxel). Individual 3D maps were computed that contained \nvoxels with individual\nregression parameters of interest (e.g., slope, b-intercept, \nR-square, predicted  -value, etc.). \nSince the null hypothesis H  in question was whether or\nnot there was equivalent change between young and older \nadults across tasks,\nthe slope value for H  was 1. To evaluate \nH  :  , the\nabsolute residual values were calculated at each data point in \nSPM2  . \nThe resulting 8 residual maps (2\nage groups over 4 tasks) were then statistically compared \nusing a t-test in\nSPM. When the n is large enough, theoretically, \nit would be more statistically\ncorrect to analyze the difference between these residuals with \na paired t-test.\nIf the null hypothesis was true, \nthen the absolute residual values would be\nequal and not statistically different from each other \n . \nIf the slope was not equal to 1, then the\nvoxel's t-test would be significant \n .\nMultiple comparisons were controlled for by using FWE of \n  < 0.05 and an\nextent threshold of at least 3 consecutive voxels. \nThe sign (+ or \u2212) and value of\nthe slope could then be assessed to determine how \nthe two groups deviated in \ntheir BOLD signals across the tasks plotted in the analysis \n(e.g., one group activates an area more across tasks then the other group). \n\nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, \nslopes of \u22121 should not be considered as\npart of the null hypothesis, since the direction of \nactivity across tasks for\nthe age groups would actually be opposite \n(i.e., young adults activating across\ntasks while older adults deactivate). \nTherefore, it is also important to\ninvestigate areas where the slope is significantly negative, \nsince the above\n\u201cresidual\u201d analysis would not just eliminate slopes \nof +1 but also slopes which\nwere not significantly different from \u22121. \nAn example of this can be seen in the\nplotted data of   \nin which this particular voxel would not be significant\nin the above \u201cresidual\u201d analysis, but still \nrepresents an interesting result. Significant\nvoxels with a slope of \u22121 can be identified using the \n -value \nof the regression\nused to fit the Peiffer plot \n(i.e.,   < .05 for the slope to be different from\nzero). Three contiguous voxels with a significant regression \n -value \nand a negative slope will be \nconsidered a cluster of interest as well. \n\nTo evaluate a significant voxel's b-intercept, \nthe 95% confidence interval was assessed. If this interval\ncontained zero, the voxel's b-intercept was considered \nnot to deviate from\nzero. Again, b-intercept clusters were considered \nsignificant if they contained\nat lest 3 contiguous voxels with significantly nonzero \nb-intercepts. \n\n\n## 3. RESULTS \n  \nThe traditional Brinley plot using average response times \nacross the 4 tasks included in the fMRI meta-analysis showed the established \ndifferences between young and older adults \n(see  ). \nThe slope of 1.4 supports general\ncognitive slowing within the dataset even though \nrelatively simple response\ntime tasks were used, and although uninterpretable \nfor response time data, the\nnegative b-intercept is also typical. With a slope \ngreater than one, older\nadults had greater differences between \ntasks in response time than younger\nadults. \n\nFor the fMRI meta-analysis, five distinct clusters \nsurvived the stringent correction applied\nfor multiple comparisons. The location of these clusters \nis summarized visually\nin   and details \nare given in Table 1\n. \nClusters of interest to competing\ntheories of general cognitive slowing were \nfound within the left pre- and\npostcentral gyrus areas as well as within the right \nmedial frontal gyrus. All\nclusters identified in the analysis had, on average, \na slope that was\nsignificantly less than one yet significantly greater \nthan negative one (see  ). \nThis slope indicates that between these 4 tasks, younger \nadults had greater BOLD signal change than older adults \nin these brain areas. Notably,\nthere is a lack of difference in between-task BOLD activity \nwithin primary\nsensory areas such as vision between older and younger adults, \neven though several studies have reported older adults \nhaving less activity than younger\nadults in sensory areas \n[ \u2013 ]. \n\nWhen the Peiffer plot was explored for 3 contiguous\nvoxels with significantly negative slopes less than zero, \n19 total clusters were identified. Nine of these \nclusters (47%) were located within the right\nmiddle and superior frontal gyri and included a total of \n68\u2009voxels (see  ). \nAcross these clusters older adults showed BOLD deactivation on \ntasks when younger adults tended to slightly activate and \nolder adults had BOLD activation\nwhen younger adults were deactivating on a task \n(average slope \u22121.89 +\/\u2212 0.21).\nThese areas appear to be activating in opposition between \nthe age groups and\nare contiguous to the right middle frontal gyrus area \n(cluster no. 4) identified\nin the \u201cresidual\u201d analysis. \nOther clusters, showing similar activity\ndifferences were seen within left medial frontal gyrus \n(2 clusters; 6\u2009voxels);\nleft inferior parietal lobule (3 clusters; 10\u2009voxels); \ncingulate gyrus (2 clusters; 7\u2009voxels); \nand single clusters within the basal ganglia (5\u2009voxels),\nmidbrain (3\u2009voxels), and the left posterior \nlobe of the cerebellum (7\u2009voxels).\nIt is important to note, however, that these findings, \nunlike those from the \u201cresidual\u201d\nanalysis above, have not been stringently controlled for \nmultiple comparisons\naside from retaining the requirement for 3 contiguous voxels. \n\nTo assess whether these slope findings were dependent \non age and not an epiphenomenon of the\ndatasets, a randomization of the age groups was \nperformed within each dataset.\nIndividuals were randomized in two groups so that the average \nage of both\ngroups was roughly equal (  \u223c  51 years of age). \nWhen the Peiffer plot was\nconstructed for these new groups, no significant clusters were \nidentified where\nthe null hypothesis (H  :  ) \nwas false. Additonally, no significant\nareas were identified where the slope was \u22121. \nThese findings thus support the\nclaim that the results of the original plot \nwere not due to the dataset\ncomposition (i.e., scanner, site, or paradigm) \nbut were dependent on separating\nthe study populations by age. \n\nAssessment of\nthe b-intercept indicated that the lack of significant \nslopes within the\nprimary sensory areas may be due to a baseline shift in activity \nbetween the\nage groups (see  ). \nFor example, within visual cortex, several areas were\nidentified that had negative b-intercepts which \nindicated that across the tasks\nolder adults tended to start from a lower BOLD \nactivity level than young adults\n(if  , then \n  negative BOLD signal). \nThis result is a continual within-task\ndifference, which is also seen in the published literature \n[ \u2013 ]; however, since this reduced\nBOLD signal in older adults is constant across several tasks, \nit does not have\na slope which deviates significantly from 1. \nIn addition, an area within right\nmotor cortex shows a positive b-intercept and thus greater \nactivity in older\nadults relative to younger adults. \nAs graciously pointed out by an anonymous\nreviewer, this result is consistent with the model hypothesis \nof hemispheric asymmetry\nin older adults (HAROLD). \nThe HAROLD model states that there is reduced\nlateralization of brain activity in older adults \nrelative to younger adults,\nwhich results from changes in neural architecture \nand not cognitive strategy \n[ , \n ]. Due to the small number of\ndata points used to construct these plots, \nthe area included within the 95% confidence\ninterval of the b-intercept is relatively large. \nTherefore, these early\nfindings may underestimate the amount of brain activity \nwhich could be\ndescribed as being affected by an age-related \nDC-shift and is thus an\nage-related BOLD signal difference that is independent of task. \n\nFinally, an epiphenomenon of the method was \nrevealed when evaluating the goodness of fit,\nas measured by the R-squared value. \nAreas where the slope was similar to one\nshowed very high R-squared values (>0.8) \nsuggesting a high predictability\nfor older adults' BOLD signal in several \nbrain regions; however, within the\nclusters identified as significantly deviant \nfrom one, R-squared values were\nlower and ranged between 0.1\u20130.46. \n\n\n## 4. DISCUSSION \n  \nHere we report the preliminary use of a \nnovel meta-analysis technique in studies on\naging, which localizes one factor of general \ncognitive slowing to the\nsensorimotor transfer. These findings lend support to \nexisting data from\nevent-related potential work indicating that \nslowing occurs predominately\nduring the time for generation of the response in older \nadults and not when evaluating\nincoming sensory material \n[ , \n ]. Deviant slopes could be\nfound in between-task BOLD activity values where younger \nadults have greater\nBOLD activity change than older adults in the \nsensorimotor transfer area in the\nleft hemisphere. Additionally, right frontal \nareas were identified with slopes\nnear \u22121, indicating that older and younger \nadults were activating these\nattentional areas in opposite directions across the tasks. \nNot surprisingly,\nmore attentionally demanding tasks have shown \nthat older adults have\ndifferential patterns of activation within the \nfrontal cortex in response to the\ntask when compared to younger participants \n[ , \n ]. \n\nAn important caveat exists, however, \nsince datasets within this analysis were obtained from\nrelatively noncognitively demanding tasks. \nIn other words, more brain areas\nmay be involved as loci of general cognitive \nslowing and would emerge as more\ncognitively demanding datasets become available for assessment. \nComparing our\ncurrent datasets to the existing literature on Brinley plots of \nreaction times,\nsimple discrimination tasks show the least amount of response \ntime slowing;\ntherefore, these BOLD signal findings presumably will only \nbecome stronger with\nthe addition of datasets containing more cognitively demanding \nconditions\n(e.g., working memory). In addition, with more tasks requiring \ngreater attentional demand, the negative slope found within right \nfrontal cortex may\nsteepen and be found within the residual analysis which \ncan control for the\nmultiple comparisons inherent within imaging data. \nPower analyses of these\npreliminary results suggest that roughly 9 datasets are needed to \nperform a meta-analysis with a paired t-test to achieve a \npower-level of 80%. \n\nInterestingly, all\nsignificant clusters identified as deviant within the \nmeta-analysis were\nseparate from peak activity differences reported in any of the \nindividual tasks\nused within the datasets. \nIf traditional meta-analysis techniques were used \n[ \u2013 ], none of these areas would\nhave been found. Utilizing this novel meta-analysis technique, \nit is possible\nto assess between-task differences in BOLD activity between \ngroups regardless\nof paradigm design, task parameters, and location of the scan. \nWhile global\nsignal correction was used to normalize \nthe datasets within this study, the\nassessment method could also be performed using \naverage group z-maps that would\nallow datasets from multiple fMRI processing software \npackages to be analyzed\ncollectively. Additionally, this method may yield \ninteresting findings in a\nvariety of study groups where a clear \u201cnormal\u201d \ngroup can be identified and used\non the  -axis \n(e.g., schizophrenics versus normals; \ndyslexics versus normals; AD versus\nnormal older adults). It is important to keep in mind that \nthe use of this\nmethod is to determine between-task differences among \ntwo populations and not\nto differentiate the two groups within any one paradigm \nof the analysis.

Systematic literature search identified 20 studies, of which, 12 examined current cannabis users (CCU) (361 CCU versus 394 non-cannabis using controls (NU)) and 3 examined abstinent cannabis users (ACU) in 5 separate comparisons (98 ACU versus 106 NU). Studies in ACU were carried out in adolescents and suggest significantly greater activation in components of the central executive and default mode networks in adolescent ACU compared to NU. While this evidence is to be interpreted with caution because studies were carried out in overlapping samples, they indicate a pressing need for independent confirmation whether certain neurofunctional alterations in adolescent cannabis users may persist even after cannabis and its metabolites are likely to have left their bodies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCannabis use has been associated with changes in cognitive task performance ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and altered brain function ( ;  ) involving various cognitive domains. Impaired task performance ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ) and brain functional alterations ( ;  ,  ) involving different cognitive domains have also been observed during acute intoxication. Recent meta-analyses employing different analytic approaches have shown that persistent long-term use of cannabis is associated with functional alterations in key brain regions across different cognitive tasks ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOne of the key issues that can potentially confound the interpretation of current evidence is whether the effects of cannabis use on cognition and underlying brain function abstinence persist or recover following a period of abstinence. Following abstinence, cognitive performance has been found to improve in cannabis users (CU) ( ) to the level of controls after longer periods of abstinence ( ), with cognitive deficits possibly only detectable within the first 25 days of abstinence. Meta-analysis of cognitive task performance in continuing CU has shown significant impairment over a wide range of tasks, while abstinent users showed no significant difference to controls in any specific or global cognitive domain ( ). In contrast, structural changes in CU have been observed ( ), in particular decreased volume in the hippocampus ( ;  ;  ), that persisted after a prolonged abstinence in some ( ) but not all studies ( ). \n\nHowever, whether the effects of recreational cannabis use on brain function persist not only beyond the acute intoxication stage typically lasting 2\u20133\u2009h ( )(when used by the inhalation route), but even after the key metabolites of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with psychotropic effects have been excreted from the body, is less well known. THC and its metabolites(11-hydroxy-\u03949-tertrahydrocannabinol and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949-tertrahrdrocannabinol ( ) are of particular interest, as it is the main psychotropic ingredient in cannabis known to be associated with harmful effects on various cognitive domains( ). It is worth noting that the half-life of THC in frequent users is 5\u201313 days ( ) and THC is detectable in urine for up-to 2\u20134 weeks( ). Interestingly, the upper limit for the period of detection of metabolites in urine is consistent with the period over which cognitive deficits are detectable following abstinence ( ). \n\nWe have recently examined the residual effects of recreational cannabis use on brain function in adult and adolescent cannabis users by meta-analytically combining the data from 20 published studies employing functional MRI techniques ( ). While some of these studies investigated cannabis-using participants after a period of abstinence, several others allowed cannabis use up until, as short a period as, 3\u2009h prior to scanning. Therefore, interpretation of the results of these studies may be confounded by residual acute effects of THC and its metabolites that may still be left in cannabis-using participants as well as effects of withdrawal from cannabis. On the other hand, brain functional alteration following a sustained period of abstinence has also been investigated, though the results of these studies are less consistent, with users showing both increased ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and decreased ( ;  ) activation compared to controls. Studies comparing cannabis users with different periods of abstinence have found greater activation in the prefrontal cortex and insula in recently abstinent users compared to users with longer (at least 27 days) periods of abstinence, who in turn had greater activation in the precentral gyrus ( ). Another study that investigated cannabis users at multiple time-points following abstinence, reported that 28 days of abstinence resulted in reduced activation difference to controls in some regions, but some differences in brain activation persisted ( ). Therefore, understanding differences in brain activation between currently using (or non-abstinent) and abstinent cannabis users (ACU), is of particular interest. However, to our knowledge existing evidence in this regard has not been systematically reviewed and summarized using meta-analytic approaches. Hence, we have carried out a meta-analysis complementary to that previously reported by us ( ) to investigate whether altered brain function associated with regular cannabis use persists even after a sustained period of abstinence from cannabis. Consistent with our approach previously ( ), we included fMRI studies that employed a wide range of cognitive activation paradigms engaging various cognitive processes rather than focusing only on task-specific approaches as in other work ( ). Our strategy was driven by two key considerations. Firstly, only a limited number of available studies have specifically employed comparable activation paradigms limiting our ability to meaningfully investigate the question of interest here. More importantly, as we have argued before ( ), the effects of cannabis use are unlikely to be limited to only those brain regions that sub-serve cognitive processes examined in studies conducted hitherto. Rather they are more likely to be widely distributed, consistent with ubiquitous distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain ( ). Therefore, we included fMRI studies employing a range of cognitive activation paradigms to investigate using a meta-analytic approach whether brain functional alterations associated with cannabis use persist even after periods of abstinence sufficiently long such that cannabis metabolites are no longer detectable in urine. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study identification \n  \nA systematic search was competed on the 13\/12\/2017 following the Cochrane Handbook ( ) and the MOOSE ( ) guidelines, using the database PubMed. Two categories of search terms were used: 1) cannabis, marijuana, marihuana, THC, tetrahydrocannabinol and 2) imaging, fMRI, functional activation, BOLD. Following screening through abstract to meet inclusion criteria. \n\nInclusion criteria were:   \nA published peer-reviewed manuscript reported in English \n  \nA data-based publication \n  \nComparison of cannabis users to a non-cannabis using control group (NU) using fMRI \n  \nReported whole-brain imaging analysis results and not just region-of-interest analysis results \n  \nUsed a cognitive or emotional activation task with no cannabis-related stimuli \n  \n\nManuscripts were separated into three categories, based on the type of cannabis-using groups reported. Those that reported at least one comparison with current cannabis users (CCU) or with abstinent cannabis users (ACU) were included while those that did not report either of the previous comparisons were excluded (flow-chart in  ; number of manuscripts indicated by \u2018N\u2019). CCU were identified as those in whom the time interval between the last cannabis smoke and scanning was a maximum of 48\u2009h (so as to avoid peak withdrawal symptoms ( )) with inclusion criteria requiring at least an average weekly use of cannabis or a positive test for THC or its metabolites at urine drug screening. ACU were required to have a monitored period of abstinence from cannabis use for at least 600\u2009h\/25 days based on previous evidence of upper limit of period of detection of THC metabolites in urine ( ) and to have provided a negative urine test for THC.   \nFlow-chart showing the identification, classification and inclusion of papers selected for meta-analysis. \n\n*One paper included two studies, one of which was eligible for inclusion, one of which was excluded. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nData extraction and data analysis using seed-based   d   mapping (SDM)( ) was conducted as outlined previously ( ) and are described here in brief. Significant peak coordinates were extracted from included studies along with their t-statistic. In papers reporting z- values or p \u2013values, t- statistics were computed using a converter provided with SDM (  \/?show\u2009=\u2009statistics). In case of studies where no inferential statistical values were reported, a \u2018p\u2019 or \u2018n\u2019 was used to indicate a positive or negative peak, respectively. As per protocol for SDM meta-analysis ( ) a study-specific text file was created for each study included in the meta-analysis, including the coordinates reported, t-value, and the number of participants for each group. In this file, the sign of the t-statistic was positive or negative, depending on the comparisons of interest. For example, for comparisons between CCU and healthy controls, greater activation in CCU compared to healthy controls was indicated as a positive t-statistic and vice versa. Similarly, for comparison of ACU with healthy controls, greater activation in ACU compared to healthy controls was indicated as a positive t-statistic and vice versa. Following this we tested whole-brain differences in activation between CCU and ACU by calculating the difference between both groups in each voxel and determining its statistical significance using a randomization test ( ). \n\nInformation regarding the brain template used to report cluster coordinates (for example, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach) was included in each study-specific file text file created as above. Any study that reported no significantly different activation peaks was also included. Each contrast completed between CU (CCU or ACU) and controls was extracted and treated as a separate studies, for example if a study reported the results of separate encoding and recall conditions in a memory task, these were treated as two separate studies, following established protocol ( ). Each study was then assigned as a study with current (CCU) or abstinent (ACU) users. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nMeta-analysis was carried out using seed based-d-mapping ( ), using the methods previously outlined ( ). For voxels that contained a peak coordinate, the unbiased effect-size and variance were computed using standard formulae ( ), while for all other voxels, the effect-size was estimated based on their distance to nearby peaks, using a 20\u2009mm full-width-at-half-maximum non-normalized Gaussian kernel ( ). For voxels that were assigned a value from more than one peak coordinate, an average value was estimated by weighting by the square of the distance to each close peak. To reduce bias from a publication reporting numerous closely located peaks, a study maximum value was employed. Both the positive and negative activations were assigned to the same map. For coordinates with no t-value, a threshold-based imputation of effect-size was carried out by estimating the mean effect-size of peaks from studies that did report t-values, separately for each significance threshold. Individual effect-size maps were created for each study and a random effects model meta-analytically combined the data from each study, by weighting each study with the inverse of the sum of its variance plus the between-study variance as obtained by the DerSimonian-Laird estimator ( ). This has been shown to be statistically comparable to the restricted maximum likelihood ( ). All maps were then included in to a meta-analysis seed-based d map, where a null distribution of the meta-analytic values was created to test which voxels had studies reporting activation difference around them by chance, using monte-carlo randomizations. Due to previous work yielding highly stable results with 20 randomizations ( ), we carried out 20 randomisations for each meta-analysis. The co-ordinates of cluster peaks were then reported using MNI coordinates. \n\nThree initial meta-analyses were completed comparing CCU to NU; comparing ACU to NU and, comparing activation in CCU to ACU. Two further meta-analyses were completed, as the ACU group contained only adolescent participants, comparing adolescent CCU compared to adolescent NU and comparing adolescent CCU to the adolescent ACU. Results have been thresholded to ensure voxel threshold\u2009=\u2009p\u2009<\u20090.005, peak height threshold: peak SDM-Z < 1, and a cluster-size threshold of clusters \u2265 10 voxels. The co-ordinates of cluster peaks were reported using MNI coordinates. \n\n\n### Assessment of study heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nHeterogeneity Q statistic was assessed in terms of a chi-squared distribution after conversion to standard z values and reported. Between\u2013study heterogeneity was assessed by comparison of heterogeneity maps. Funnel plots were created for each cluster peak and Egger\u2019s test performed in order to asses publication bias ( ). \n\n\n### Assessment of study quality \n  \nQuality assessment of each study was completed using criteria previously used for fMRI studies ( ), which we have reported before ( ).The quality assessment reported here has been amended to also include assessment of the extent to which studies accounted for use of substances other than cannabis. No studies were excluded from analysis based on this quality assessment. Studies that matched groups on use of substances other than cannabis scored 2 points, while those that did not study matched groups but instead used statistical methods to control for group differences in use of substances other than cannabis scored 1 point. Finally, certain studies controlled for only some substances and were rated 0.5 and studies that neither matched participant groups based on use of substances other than cannabis, nor controlled for them analytically were rated 0. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies \n  \nTwenty studies were identified as meeting study inclusion criteria as detailed earlier. Of those, twelve manuscripts met inclusion criteria as reporting CCU, with 22 separate comparisons, comparing 361 CCU to 394 NU ( ). Three manuscripts were identified as having studied ACU with 5 separate comparisons, comparing 98 ACU to 106 NU ( ). Five manuscripts and one comparison from another manuscript were excluded as they had large ranges of abstinence within their cannabis using group ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ) or had abstinent periods (between 48 and 600\u2009h) that were not consistent with our pre-defined abstinence criteria for inclusion in the \u2018abstinent users\u2019 group. Number of studies included for each comparison are indicated by \u2018k\u2019 and number of participants for each comparison are indicated by \u2018n\u2019 henceforth in the text as well as in the relevant sections of tables or figures.   \nStudies included in meta-analysis. \n  Table 1     \n\nSummary of quality assessment of studies included in the present meta-analyses are reported in  . Although, no studies were excluded from analysis based on this quality assessment, as is evident from the summary, studies did not always control for the effect of substances other than cannabis that may have been used by study participants. However, it is worth noting that all of the adolescent ACU studies controlled for these effects statistically.   \nQuality assessment. \n  Table 2     \n\nAll studies qualifying for the ACU group, were carried out in adolescent users. Further meta-analysis comparing ACU and CCU, using only adolescent studies was completed. Data from three manuscripts reporting on current adolescent users, with four separate comparisons, with 69 CCU and 70 NU were used for comparison with the abstinent adolescent user group described above. Results for all meta-analyses are reported in   and  .   \nResults from meta-analyses. \n  Table 3       \nMaps of statistically significant differences in activation (Voxel threshold\u2009=\u2009p\u2009<\u20090.005, peak height threshold: peak SDM-Z < 1, clusters \u2265 10).

A decrease in activation was found in CCU compared to NU in the left cuneus, extending ipsilaterally to the superior, middle, and inferior occipital gyri; and in the right precentral gyrus, (k\u2009=\u200922; CU n\u2009=\u2009361, NU n\u2009=\u2009394). \n\n\n### Adolescent ACU compared to NU \n  \nMeta-analysis of adolescent ACU compared to NU revealed that ACU had increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus; right precuneus, extending ipsilaterally to the superior parietal gyrus; and the right middle occipital gyrus, extending ipsilaterally to the superior occipital gyrus and cuneus; the middle frontal gyrus extending to the superior frontal gyrus bilaterally and the inferior parietal gyri bilaterally, extending to the superior parietal gyrus bilaterally and the right angular gyrus. There were no areas where brain activation was significantly decreased in ACU compared to NU (k\u2009=\u20095; CU n\u2009=\u200998, NU n\u2009=\u2009106). \n\n\n### Adult and adolescent CCU compared to adolescent ACU \n  \nMeta-analysis comparing CCU including both adult and adolescent studies to adolescent ACU, revealed no areas where brain activation was significantly increased in CCU compared to ACU, However, ACU had increased activation in the right precuneus, extending ipsilaterally to postcentral and superior parietal gyrI; the left lingual gyrus, extending ipsilaterally to superior and middle occipital gyri; the left middle frontal gyrus extending ipsilaterally to superior frontal gyrus; and the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally extending to superior parietal gyrus bilaterally and to the right angular gyrus, (CCU: k\u2009=\u200922; n\u2009=\u2009361; ACU: k\u2009=\u20095; n\u2009=\u200998). \n\n\n### Adolescent CCU compared to NU \n  \nMeta-analysis of adolescent CCU revealed that adolescent CCU had increased activation when compared to NU in the right middle frontal gyrus extending ipsilaterally to the inferior frontal gyrus ; and the middle occipital gyrus on the right side. There were no areas where brain activation was significantly decreased in adolescent CCU compared to (k\u2009=\u20094; CU n\u2009=\u200969, NU n\u2009=\u200970). \n\n\n### Adolescent CCU compared to adolescent ACU \n  \nMeta-analysis of adolescent CCU compared to adolescent ACU, revealed that there were no areas where brain activation was significantly different between adolescent CCU and adolescent ACU NU (CCU: k\u2009=\u20094; n\u2009=\u200969; ACU: k\u2009=\u20095; n\u2009=\u200998). \n\n\n### Study heterogeneity \n  \nFunnel plots were created and examined for each cluster from each meta-analysis. Egger\u2019s tests were used with no cluster reaching significance, indicating no publication bias (see  ). SDM-Z scores for each peak are reported in  , no between-study heterogeneity was seen in the adolescent only ACU vs NU, CCU vs NU and ACU vs CCU meta-analyses. In the mixed age group comparison of ACU vs CCU, some heterogeneity was seen in the cluster spanning the left superior frontal gyrus. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe key comparisons of interest in the present set of analyses relate to the brain activation differences between ACU and NU and that between ACU and CCU. Although the ACU versus NU comparison was limited to only studies in adolescent cannabis users (as no studies in adult users met our stringent inclusion criteria for ACU), we found significantly greater activation in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, which are part of the central executive network and are known to be involved in higher order cognitive processes such as attentional control, executive function and working memory ( ;  ). These findings are similar to those found by a study in adolescent cannabis users following an abstinence period of average 5 weeks ( ). Furthermore, ACU also displayed greater activation compared to NU in regions that are part of the default mode network ( ) such as the cuneus, inferior parietal cortex and angular gyrus as well as the visual cortex. Comparison of ACU and CCU across all studies (both adult and adolescent) revealed greater activation in ACU across regions within the central executive (dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices) and default mode (inferior parietal cortex and precuneus) network as well as lingual and precentral gyri. However, these differences were likely a result of CCU group including both adult and adolescent studies with ACU group including only adolescent studies. Direct comparison between ACU and CCU limited to studies in adolescent users alone revealed no significant group differences in brain activation. Further comparisons between CCU and NU across all eligible studies revealed activation differences in certain brain regions (such as inferior frontal gyrus where CCU\u2009>\u2009NU; and superior, middle and inferior occipital and precentral gyri where CCU\u2009<\u2009NU) that were broadly consistent with results from comparisons between all cannabis users and non-users in our previous meta-analysis ( ). Although, no comparably consistent patterns emerged from meta-analysis of adolescent studies alone, it is worth noting the limited number of studies eligible for inclusion for this comparison. Nevertheless, the robustness of our findings was supported by the results of the heterogeneity analysis, which showed no between-study heterogeneity in these clusters, as well as the results of the Egger\u2019s test, which also showed that none of the reported clusters were significantly affected by publication bias. \n\nCollectively, results of the present meta-analysis clearly suggest that at least in adolescent cannabis users, brain functional alterations persist even after periods of abstinence equivalent to around 25 days, by when cannabis metabolites are no longer detectable in urine. One cannot be certain on the basis of present analyses whether similar functional alterations also persist in adult regular cannabis users after comparable periods of abstinence. However, functional alterations in similar brain areas as reported here have also been observed in adult occasional cannabis users compared to non-users after prolonged abstinence ( ,  ). Adolescence is a period of particular vulnerability to the effects of exogenous insults ( ;  ;  ;  ) such as from use of drugs like cannabis, especially in light of progressive change in the density of cannabinoid receptors ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, results presented here specifically underscore the particular vulnerability of the adolescent brain to residual effects of long-term cannabis use even after the drug and its metabolites have been fully excreted from the body. \n\nWhat might underlie these functional differences between abstinent adolescent cannabis users and non-users? Evidence from two independent studies suggest downregulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 density in regular cannabis users ( ;  ), which returns to normal levels following comparable periods of abstinence ( ;  ), with normalisation starting as early as following 2 days of abstinence ( ). This may suggest that functional alterations in abstinent adolescent cannabis users are unlikely to be related to altered availability of cannabinoid type 1 receptors. Whether these effects are related to longer-term alterations in glutamatergic ( ) or dopaminergic ( ) neurotransmitter systems also known to be affected by cannabis remains to be tested. The cross-sectional nature of the studies included in the present meta-analyses precludes inference regarding the precise nature of changes detected, whether they are a cause or consequence of cannabis use. Future, studies adopting longitudinal and genetically informed designs are necessary to disentangle causal factors from consequential effects ( ). Additional limitations need to be carefully considered while interpreting these results. Most importantly, this meta-analysis was limited by the number of studies available for inclusion. As a result, all studies meeting criteria for the ACU group contained only adolescent participants. As no adult studies met our criteria for inclusion to the abstinent group, it is therefore difficult to infer that functional alterations in adult users similarly persist following longer periods of abstinence. Results of comparisons between CCU and NU are also limited by inclusion of both adult and adolescent studies rather than separate analyses, in light of potentially different effects in these age groups ( ). However, this does not affect the key results of ACU vs NU and ACU vs CCU in adolescent only studies. Furthermore, the three papers investigating adolescent ACU were reported from the same research group, with almost complete overlap in the cohorts reported in two of the studies ( ;  ) and around 45% overlap with a much larger cohort reported by  ). Therefore, it may be argued that the meta-analysis results are inflated on account of non-trivial overlap of the samples investigated. However, it is also worth noting that these 3 studies reported on three distinct fMRI activation paradigms ( ,  ;  ). While this does not address the issue of overlapping samples, it suggests some degree of consistency across different cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, this highlights the limited nature of evidence currently available regarding longer term effects of cannabis that persist even after its metabolites are no longer detectable in the system, and underscore the need for further studies in this area. Another important limitation worth noting relates to the effects of withdrawal symptoms confounding comparisons including CCU. Again this is unlikely to have affected comparisons between ACU and NU as most withdrawal symptoms typically return to baseline by 2 weeks ( ), while participants were abstinent for longer duration (25 days) in studies included in the ACU group. While some studies controlled for the potential confounding effects of other psychoactive substances (e.g. nicotine, alcohol) either statistically or by including study groups matched for use of these substances, others did not. Therefore, we cannot be completely certain that results of our meta-analyses were not influenced by potential effects of these substances on brain function, when they incorporated such studies that did not consider the confounding effect of comorbid exposure to other substances. Cannabis use parameters, such as age of onset and frequency of use, have been previously found to be important in relation to neurological changes ( ). A limited number of studies in the different sub-groups also precluded systematic examination of the relationship with the extent of previous cannabis use. The cannabinoid compositions of cannabis with regard to THC and cannabindiol levels has been found produce difference effects ( ), with high THC cannabis linked to increases in extreme psychological outcomes ( ), no study has yet have reported cannabis type. Future studies may wish to further explore cannabis composition as a measure, alongside cannabis use parameters. Further to this, only certain types of cognitive processes, due to the limited number of studies, may have biased the results based on the cognitive processes used. The tasks employed by the adolescent ACU and CCU both included go\/no go task, but the ACU group studies reported on two memory-related tasks as well, whereas the CCU had gambling and finger tapping tasks. While this may have introduced bias ( ), it is worth noting that comparison groups (NU) were studied with the same tasks. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out this possibility. Methodological heterogeneity between studies, such as cannabis use levels, selective reporting of only results that reached statistical significance as is common practice, and studies with small sample sizes, are also caveats that are worth considering while interpreting these results. \n\nNotwithstanding limitations highlighted above, results from the present meta-analyses suggest that certain neurofunctional alterations in components of the central executive and default mode networks in adolescent cannabis users may persist even after cannabis and its metabolites are likely to have left their bodies. However, given the overlap in the samples that support the key conclusions reported here, there is an urgent need for independent studies investigating whether brain function in abstinent cannabis users differ significantly from non-users following a sustained period of monitored abstinence, both in adolescents as well as in adults.

By comparison, the prosaccade task requires participants to make a visually-guided saccade to the target. These tasks have been studied extensively using behavioral oculomotor, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging in both non-human primates and humans. In humans, the antisaccade task is under active investigation as a potential endophenotype or biomarker for multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders. A large and growing body of literature has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to study the neural correlates of the antisaccade and prosaccade tasks. We present a quantitative meta-analysis of all published voxel-wise fMRI and PET studies (18) of the antisaccade task and show that consistent activation for antisaccades and prosaccades is obtained in a fronto-subcortical-parietal network encompassing frontal and supplementary eye fields (SEFs), thalamus, striatum, and intraparietal cortex. This network is strongly linked to oculomotor control and was activated to a greater extent for antisaccade than prosaccade trials. Antisaccade but not prosaccade trials additionally activated dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices. We also found that a number of additional regions not classically linked to oculomotor control were activated to a greater extent for antisaccade vs. prosaccade trials; these regions are often reported in antisaccade studies but rarely commented upon. While the number of studies eligible to be included in this meta-analysis was small, the results of this systematic review reveal that antisaccade and prosaccade trials consistently activate a distributed network of regions both within and outside the classic definition of the oculomotor network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe antisaccade task (Hallet,  ) is a classic paradigm in the study of cognitive control that requires participants to inhibit a reflexive saccade and instead make a volitional saccade toward the mirror opposite location.   Antisaccade   trials are often compared to   prosaccade   trials where participants make a visually-guided saccade toward a peripheral target. This task has been studied extensively in the behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging literature in both non-human primates and humans, as such the basic neural circuitry underlying this task is quite well understood (see Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ; Hutton,  ; McDowell et al.,   for reviews). It has also been studied extensively in psychiatric and neurologically impaired populations such as schizophrenia (e.g., Raemaekers et al.,  ), autism (e.g., Manoach et al.,  ), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Mostofsky et al.,  ), Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Kaufman et al.,  ), Parkinson's disease (e.g., Cameron et al.,  ), Huntington's disease (e.g., Blekher et al.,  ), and multiple sclerosis (e.g., Fielding et al.,  ) leading to a number of these conditions being \u201ccharacterized\u201d by deficits in volitional saccadic eye movements. \n\nThe antisaccade task recruits a broad range of cognitive processes, including goal-directed behavior, attention, working memory, learning, and decision-making (Hutton,  ). Despite the considerable number of studies that have examined the antisaccade task, there is surprisingly little consensus as to which cognitive processes healthy participants use when performing this task. According to classical accounts of the task, antisaccade trials require at least two additional processes compared to prosaccade trials: the suppression of the automatic response to make a visually-guided prosaccade toward the target, and the inversion of the stimulus location into a voluntary motor command to look away from the stimulus (Guitton et al.,  ; Everling and Fischer,  ). These models argue that this additional processing for antisaccade trials accounts for the increased latency and activity in the oculomotor network for antisaccade vs. prosaccade trials (McDowell et al.,  ). More recent models have moved away from this serial additive factors logic and instead argue for a parallel processing model (Massen,  ; Munoz and Everling,  ; Reuter and Kathmann,  ; Hutton and Ettinger,  ). These models are conceptually similar to evidence accumulation models proposed earlier (e.g., Ratcliff,  ; Carpenter,  ; see Isoda and Hikosaka,  ). For example, Massen ( ) argues that at stimulus onset, there is competition between the exogenously triggered prosaccade and endogenously triggered antisaccade. If the antisaccade response is computed fast enough and reaches threshold quickly, it wins the competition and the visually-guided saccade is canceled; if it is not computed fast enough, the exogenous prosaccade is executed. Models differ on whether they include an explicit inhibitory process of the prepotent prosaccade response on antisaccade trials. Munoz and Everling ( ) and Isoda and Hikosaka ( ) argue that this inhibitory process is critical to correct antisaccade performance, allowing the antisaccade response to reach threshold before the prosaccade response. \n\nA large and growing body of literature has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the neural correlates of antisaccade performance in both healthy controls and psychiatric\/neurologically-impaired populations. The task reliably activates a distributed oculomotor control network, including the frontal eye fields (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among others (see Hutton and Ettinger,  ; McDowell et al.,   for reviews). In general, antisaccade trials activate this oculomotor network to a greater extent than prosaccade trials, and may also recruit additional regions not required on prosaccade trials, such as the anterior cingulate (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; McDowell et al.,  ). Understanding how healthy controls activate the oculomotor network is of great importance, as the task is currently under consideration as a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia (Ettinger et al.,  ; Jablensky,  ; Ritsner and Gottesman,  ) and also shows promise as a biomarker for Friedreich Ataxia (Fielding et al.,  ), Huntington's disease (Blekher et al.,  ) and multiple sclerosis (Fielding et al.,  ). \n\nHere, we present a quantitative meta-analysis of existing fMRI and PET studies of the antisaccade and prosaccade tasks. This quantitative meta-analysis is aimed to complement the excellent systematic reviews of the task published recently (Hutton and Ettinger,  ; Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ; McDowell et al.,  ). The motivation for this quantitative meta-analysis was twofold. Firstly, to examine the consistency of activation for antisaccades and prosaccades across the brain; many studies that examine the antisaccade task in both healthy and impaired individuals tend to focus narrowly on a few   a priori   regions of interest (ROI), such as FEF and IPS, thus ignoring potentially interesting contributors to performance. One obvious example of this is the paucity of studies that include cerebellar ROIs despite evidence that multiple cerebellar regions contribute significantly to antisaccade performance and oculomotor processes in general (Robinson and Fuchs,  ). Establishing which regions are consistently activated by the task across the brain in healthy individuals will assist in the study and development of the task as a robust endophenotype\/biomarker (see also Raemaekers et al.,   for a study of test-retest reliability of the antisaccade task). Secondly, fMRI studies that use the ROI approach typically construct their ROIs using anatomy or functional localizer scans. Both approaches are potentially problematic. Anatomical ROIs are problematic as it can be difficult to unambiguously determine the position of functional regions on the basis of anatomy alone. Anatomical localization of a number of regions including FEF and oculomotor IPS in humans differs substantially between individuals (Paus,  ; Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ; Amiez and Petrides,  ). With regards to functional ROIs, many studies use a separate localizer scan to establish a study-specific definition of the oculomotor regions. Thus, the definition of the ROI from group maps of the localizer task is necessarily limited by the sample size of the study and of the context sensitivity of the localizer (Friston et al.,  ). A major goal of the current study was to determine the most consistently activated regions in the antisaccade task in order to create activation masks for restricted ROI analyses in future studies. As such, these ROIs will be created using a much larger sample size than is feasible in many studies, and are also created on the basis of the most consistently activated regions across studies. The resulting FEF ROI can be considered complementary to the previous work of Paus ( ), who reviewed the location of the human FEF on the basis of early PET studies. In this way, the results of this meta-analysis may assist future researchers to overcome the problems associated with using anatomical ROIs and functional localizers. \n\nWe hypothesized that cortical regions classically associated with oculomotor control would be consistently activated, including the FEF, SEF and IPS, as well as regions associated with oculomotor control but not widely discussed in fMRI or PET studies, including subcortical (thalamic, striatal), and cerebellar regions. Additionally, we hypothesized that since studies tend to focus their discussions narrowly on regions defined as \u201coculomotor,\u201d a number of additional regions would also be consistently active, including the visual cortex, and each of these regions would be activated to a greater extent in antisaccade compared to prosaccade trials. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### The antisaccade paradigm \n  \nIn the antisaccade paradigm, participants are required to perform simple saccadic eye movements, either toward a peripheral target when it appears (  prosaccade   trials) or in the mirror opposite direction of the peripheral target (  antisaccade   trials). After the target is extinguished, participants are usually required to make a return saccade back to central fixation (see Hutton and Ettinger,   for a review). Behaviorally, the antisaccade task yields a number of measures: error rate, reaction time\/latency of the saccade, the time to correct errors (the time between the erroneous prosaccade to the subsequent corrective antisaccade), amplitude of correct and incorrect saccades and final eye position of the antisaccade. The majority of fMRI studies record video-oculography or infra-red oculography and simply report error rates and latencies. \n\n\n### Selection procedures \n  \nThe literature review and selection of manuscripts for the meta-analysis was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). These guidelines outline a structured methodology for the performance of a meta-analysis and\/or systematic review, with the aim of improving the quality of published reviews. \n\nA systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant studies. First, we carried out a PubMed search to identify putative fMRI studies of the antisaccade task using the search terms \u201cantisaccade\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d; only studies published in English were included (this restriction excluded a single manuscript, Fukushima,  , published in Japanese). In addition, only studies in humans were selected (excluding four manuscripts). The search was conducted in October 2012, and extended in July 2013 to include PET studies. This search identified 74 manuscripts. In the second step, the reference lists of the articles identified were manually checked for relevant studies not identified in the PubMed literature search; this search identified 14 additional manuscripts. These 84 manuscripts were then screened according to the following criteria: (a) being an original article in a peer-reviewed journal, (b) have used BOLD-fMRI or PET, and (c) have included at least one non-psychiatric\/neurologically-impaired group in the age ranges 18\u201375 years. This selection procedure identified 55 studies. \n\nFive manuscripts were identified as re-analyses of previously published data [Miller et al.,   (duplicating Curtis and D'Esposito,  ); Polli et al.,   (duplicating Polli et al.,  ); Roffman et al.,   (duplicating Manoach et al.,  ); Velanova et al.,   (duplicating Velanova et al.,  ); Hwang et al.,   (duplicating Velanova et al.,  )]. In the case of Miller et al. ( ); Polli et al. ( ), and Roffman et al. ( ), the original manuscripts presented data relevant to the current manuscript, so Miller et al. ( ); Polli et al. ( ) and Roffman et al. were excluded. In the case of Velanova et al. ( ,  ) and Hwang et al. ( ), only Hwang et al. presented data relevant to the current meta-analysis, so the Velanova et al. ( ,  ) studies were excluded. \n\nThe remaining 51 manuscripts were then screened in more detail and classified as: (a) whole-brain or partial-brain fMRI acquisition, (b) whether, in developmental\/psychiatric\/neurologically-impaired studies, results for a healthy control group (18\u201375 years) were shown separately, (c) coordinates in MNI or Talairach space were reported for the contrasts of interest, and (d) voxel-wise or region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Inclusion of studies into a meta-analysis that use ROI analyses can bias the results (Ragland et al.,  ). Five studies acquired functional scans that did not encompass most of the cortex [Cameron et al.,   (11 slices, over the caudate); Connolly et al.,  ,   (6 slices, FEF and parietal lobes only); Medendorp et al.,   (9 slices over parietal lobe only); Neggers et al.,   (30 slices over FEF and subcortical regions only)]; Brown et al. ( ); Cameron et al. ( ), and Raemaekers et al. ( ) were included because they imaged almost all the cortex and subcortical regions. Six studies did not present analyses for a healthy control group aged 18\u201375 years separate from a developmental\/psychiatric\/neurologically impaired group (Raemaekers et al.,  ,  ; Camchong et al.,  ; Thakkar et al.,  ; Agam et al.,  ; Dyckman et al.,  ), and four studies did not report coordinates for the contrast of interest (Polli et al.,  ; Raemaekers et al.,  , ; Lee et al.,  ). Of the remaining 35 manuscripts, eleven studies only reported results from ROI analyses (Muri et al.,  ; Luna et al.,  ; Cornelissen et al.,  ; DeSouza et al.,  ; McDowell et al.,  ; Curtis and D'Esposito,  ; Raemaekers et al.,  ; Polli et al.,  ; DeWeijer et al.,  ; Geier et al.,  ; Roffman et al.,  ), one reported results masked by an orthogonal contrast (Klein et al.,  ) and one reported coordinates from only frontal and parietal cortices (Anderson et al.,  ). In addition, four manuscripts (Dyckman et al.,  ; Curtis and Connolly,  ; Reuter et al.,  ; Harsay et al.,  ) were excluded as they did not report a simple antisaccade\/prosaccade contrast. Note that two studies (Kimmig et al.,  ; Hwang et al.,  ) reported ROI results, however, these ROIs were functionally defined from the results of the reported contrast and so were included in the analysis. \n\nFollowing this systematic search, 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Table  ). Of these studies, ten were block-design, seven were event-related, and one was mixed-design. Sample sizes were modest (range 9\u201354 subjects), four studies used PET and fourteen used fMRI, three included a developmental\/psychiatric\/neurologically-impaired group, and two rated subjects on the basis of other factors (smoking, schizotypy) but were otherwise psychiatrically and neurologically healthy. Across all studies the total number of subjects contributing to the meta-analysis is 315. \n  \n Studies included in the meta-analysis  . \n    \nA number of steps were taken to ensure all results included in the meta-analysis were in the same stereotaxic space. The majority of manuscripts reported results in Talairach coordinates (Table  ); those that reported results in MNI space were transformed using the icbm2tal transform (Lancaster et al.,  ). In addition, the four manuscripts that reported results in Talairach space converted from MNI space using the Brett mni2tal transform ( ) were converted back to MNI space using the inverse tal2mni transform, then converted to Talairach space using the icbm2tal transform. \n\n\n### Quantitative meta-analysis procedures \n  \nQuantitative meta-analysis was conducted using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) as implemented in GingerALE v2.1 (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). ALE is a random effects voxel-based method for finding concordance across manuscripts and does not rely upon author-assigned anatomical labels; rather, it only requires that activation foci are reported in standard stereotaxic space (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). In ALE, each activation focus from each experiment is modeled as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution, scaled inversely by the square root of the sample size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). That is, the width of the modeled probability distribution reflects the uncertainty of the spatial localization by taking into account between-subject variance. In this way, foci from studies with small   n   will be modeled as a more blurred function with less localizing impact, and foci from studies with large   n   will be modeled as tighter, more highly weighted function (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Following the transformation of the coordinates into probability functions, a whole-brain map is created by assigning a value to every gray-matter voxel in the brain that reflects the probability that a reported foci lies within that voxel (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The ALE value tends to be small due to the large number of voxels in the brain (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The   activation likelihood estimation   map is then thresholded using standard imaging statistical methods (Laird et al.,  ). Statistical significance was determined using an FDR correction of   p   < 0.05, with minimum cluster size of 200 mm , as implemented in GingerALE v2.1, and described by Laird et al. ( ) and Eickhoff et al. ( ). \n\nThree separate meta-analyses were conducted: (1) antisaccade greater than fixation or rest, (2) prosaccade greater than fixation or rest, (3) antisaccade greater than prosaccade. Very few studies examined prosaccade greater than antisaccade so this was not considered. Additionally, given that the number of manuscripts reporting (2) was modest (8 studies), a quantitative conjunction or subtraction between (1) and (2) at the meta-analysis level was not possible. For all analyses, coordinates from event-related designs were sourced from analyses locked to the target or response (i.e., not to cues\/preparation interval). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Antisaccade > fixation and prosaccade > fixation \n  \nTen manuscripts reported foci for antisaccade greater than fixation, yielding 168 total foci. Antisaccade trials consistently activated eighteen regions (Table  , Figure  , red). These activations were largely bilateral, and encompassed frontal and SEFs, IPS, thalamus, caudate, putamen, insula, precuneus, and lingual gyrus. \n  \n Talairach coordinates, volume (mm ), ALE values and anatomical labels for the antisaccade > fixation analysis  . \n  \nBrodmann areas are given for the peak of ALE within the cluster. \n    \n Activation likelihood maps for antisaccade > fixation (red) and prosaccade > fixation (green)  .

Prosaccade trials activated six regions (Table  , Figure  , green), including frontal and supplementary eye fields, IPS, and precuneus. \n  \n Talairach coordinates, volume (mm ), ALE values and anatomical labels for the prosaccade > fixation analysis  . \n  \nBrodmann areas are given for the peak of ALE within the cluster. \n  \nAs can be seen from Figure   and Table  , antisaccade > fixation tended to activate a more distributed set of regions than prosaccade > fixation. While there was considerable overlap between the two contrasts, the spatial extent of activation tended to be greater in antisaccade > fixation compared to prosaccade > fixation. \n\n\n### Antisaccade > prosaccade \n  \nThirteen manuscripts reported foci for antisaccade greater than prosaccade, yielding 192 total foci. Antisaccade vs. prosaccade trials (Table  , Figure  ) consistently activated 13 regions, including frontal and SEFs, IPS, anterior cingulate, DLPFC, precuneus, insula, and cerebellar tonsil. The set of regions obtained in this analysis were broadly compatible but not identical with the regions obtained in the antisaccade > fixation: antisaccade > prosaccade consistently activated subcortical regions whereas antisaccade > fixation did not, also antisaccade > fixation consistently activated anterior cingulate and cerebellum whereas antisaccade > prosaccade did not. \n  \n Talairach coordinates, volume (mm ), ALE values and anatomical labels for the antisaccade > prosaccade analysis  . \n    \n Activation likelihood maps for antisaccade > prosaccade  .

Here, we focused on voxel-wise studies of healthy individuals to establish regions that are consistently activated by the task. \n\nAntisaccade trials vs. fixation consistently activated a broad range of regions classically associated with oculomotor control and often used as a priori ROIs, including bilateral FEF, SEF, IPS, thalamus, caudate, and putamen. Additionally, activation was consistently obtained in precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (in the frontopolar cortex), cuneus, lingual gyrus, and insula. Prosaccade trials vs. fixation also consistently activated the right FEF, SEF, and bilateral IPS. The contrast of most interest to the current study, antisaccade vs. prosaccade trials, revealed that antisaccades indeed consistently activated the oculomotor network of FEF, SEF, IPS, insula to a greater extent than prosaccades, and additionally recruited the ACC, DLPFC, and cerebellar tonsil. These quantitative results confirm the conclusions of recent systematic reviews of the literature (e.g., Hutton and Ettinger,  ; Sweeney et al.,  ; McDowell et al.,  ). \n\nIn the following, we discuss each of the regions activated by antisaccades and their contribution to the oculomotor network for volitional saccades. \n\n### Regions consistently activated in antisaccades and prosaccades \n  \nThe FEF is positioned at the intersection between the precentral and superior frontal sulci and is cytoarchitectonically defined as a motor cortex (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ). It is directly involved in oculomotor control via connections with the superior colliculus and the midbrain oculomotor nuclei (Bruce and Goldberg,  ; Everling and Munoz,  ). In the antisaccade task, the FEF is thought to be involved in preparing the antisaccade response in advance and the perceptual decision-making processes leading up to the saccade (Ford et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ,  ; Ettinger et al.,  ). Pierrot-Deseilligny et al. ( ) argue that it is less involved in visually-guided prosaccades, consistent with our findings that the total volume of FEF activity was larger in antisaccades vs. prosaccades. McDowell et al. ( ) argue that since medial and lateral FEF have different projections to parietal and frontal regions, these regions may differ functionally; they argue that medial FEF may be involved more in volitional antisaccades and lateral FEF may be involved more in visually-guided prosaccades. Our results suggest a refinement of this argument: prosaccade vs. fixation consistently activated lateral FEF (Talairach x = \u00b140) whereas antisaccade vs. fixation consistently activated both lateral (x = +36\/\u221238) and medial (x = \u00b126) aspects. This result is reflected in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast as a medial FEF activation only. While further study is required, this result suggests that the lateral FEF may be involved in both volitional antisaccades and visually-guided prosaccades, whereas the medial FEF may be involved more specifically in volitional antisaccades. Future studies should examine this possibility. \n\nThe SEF is located on the medial wall in the paracentral sulcus in the human brain (Amiez and Petrides,  ). It is thought to be the oculomotor extension of the supplementary motor area (Schall,  ) and typically shows greater activity during cognitively demanding saccades vs. visually-guided saccades (Olson and Gettner,  ; McDowell et al.,  ). Here, the SEF was consistently activated for both antisaccade and prosaccades, but as hypothesized the extent of the activation was greater for antisaccades, reflected in the consistent activation in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast. In the antisaccade task, the SEF plays a role in the preparation of a voluntary antisaccade as it is maximally activated just before the execution of the saccade (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ; Ford et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ). Within competition-based models, it has been argued that the SEF sends the inhibitory signal to suppress the prepotent prosaccade response, giving the antisaccade response time to reach threshold before the prosaccade response (Schlag-Rey et al.,  ; Amador et al.,  ; Boxer et al.,  ). The finding that SEF activity in the preparatory interval predicts accurate performance (Schlag-Rey et al.,  ; Amador et al.,  ) is consistent with this argument. \n\nAntisaccade and prosaccade trials consistently activated the IPS. As hypothesized, antisaccade trials activated the IPS to a greater extent than prosaccade trials. The IPS extends from the postcentral sulcus anteriorly to the parieto-occipital sulcus posteriorly, separating the superior and inferior parietal lobules (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ; Grefkes and Fink,  ). The human homolog of the lateral intraparietal area, the parietal eye field (PEF) is located in the posterior part of the IPS and projects to the FEF and superior colliculus (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ,  ). IPS activation in the antisaccade task is traditionally linked to the process of vector inversion\u2014that is, the translation of the visual location of the target to the mirror image location (Medendorp et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ; Nyffeler et al.,  ), thus it is considered not to be critical for the execution of the saccade, rather the ability to accurately perform the saccade to the mirror image location. Note that in this meta-analysis we focused on target or response-locked contrasts, thus demonstrating that the IPS is consistently activated during the saccadic response itself. Most studies argue that this region is not critically involved in preparatory set\u2014i.e., that it is not activated in the pre-target interval (Connolly et al.,  ,  ; Curtis and D'Esposito,  ), although this finding is equivocal (DeSouza et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ). Additionally, Anderson et al. ( ) argue that the IPS also contributes to the inhibition of the prepotent prosaccade response in a   reactive   manner, which contrasts with the proposed   proactive   inhibitory role of the FEF and SEF discussed previously. \n\n\n### Regions consistently activated in antisaccades but not prosaccades \n  \nThe ACC was consistently active for antisaccades vs. prosaccades. We found two foci of activity that correspond to the rostral ACC and dorsal ACC (Devinsky et al.,  ; Bush et al.,  ); these foci did not appear to overlap with the cingulate eye field (Gaymard et al.,  ), as the foci were more inferior than reported previously (Amiez and Petrides,  ). The ACC is known to play a critical role in performance monitoring and conflict detection (MacDonald et al.,  ; Botvinick et al.,  ,  ; Braver et al.,  ). Polli et al. ( ) conducted a systematic investigation of the role of the rostral and dorsal portions of the ACC in the antisaccade task and reported that during the preparatory phase of the antisaccade trial, correct but not incorrect antisaccade trials showed significant deactivation of the rostral ACC. This was linked to default mode network deactivation, which is considered critical for concentration on the task at hand (Raichle et al.,  ). During the same period, dorsal ACC was active for both correct and incorrect antisaccades, but the magnitude of the activation was related to fewer errors for antisaccade trials. In the later phase of the trial, both rostral and dorsal ACC showed increased activity for incorrect vs. correct antisaccade trials. Polli et al. ( ) concluded that both rostral and dorsal ACC were critical for performance optimization on the task, whereas only rostral ACC was critical for performance evaluation. \n\nAntisaccade vs. prosaccade contrasts consistently activated the DLPFC. Within the oculomotor control network, the DLPFC is considered to take a supervisory role, biasing other oculomotor areas in the service of current behavioral goals (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al.,  ,  ; Ford et al.,  ; Brown et al.,  ; Ettinger et al.,  ; Hwang et al.,  ). This is consistent with formulations of DLPFC function in other domains including attentional control (Corbetta and Shulman,  ), task-rule representation (Crone et al.,  ), task-set maintenance and switching (Jamadar et al.,  ) and working memory (Curtis and D'Esposito,  ). Here, we found consistent activation for antisaccades > prosaccades in right DLPFC. Lateralization of the antisaccade vs. prosaccade difference in the right hemisphere has been noted previously (Ford et al.,  ; Ettinger et al.,  ) although it has not been rigorously tested, here or elsewhere. Right DLPFC activity in the antisaccade > prosaccade contrast has been linked to a general response inhibition process (Garavan et al.,  ). Likewise, the right VLPFC was consistently active in the antisaccade vs. fixation contrast and has widely been implicated in inhibitory control (Aron and Poldrack,  ; Jamadar et al.,  ) and evidence suggests that this region is critical for inhibiting the prepotent response in the oculomotor and somatic motor domains (Chickazoe et al.,  ). Future studies should directly test for lateralization effects in DLPFC during antisaccades. \n\nA number of subcortical regions, including the thalamus, caudate, and putamen were consistently activated in antisaccade vs. fixation. Intriguingly, these regions were not evident in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast even though they were evident in the antisaccade vs. fixation but not prosaccade vs. fixation contrasts. This finding was not attributable to sub-threshold activation likelihood estimates in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast, as reducing the threshold to   p   < 0.10 FDR corrected did not yield significant activation likelihood estimates in these regions. Thus, when using a fixation baseline but not prosaccade baseline the thalamus, putamen, and caudate are consistently activated. The putamen and caudate, collectively known as the   striatum  , are known to play a pivotal role in the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia networks in both oculomotor (e.g., Isoda and Hikosaka,  ) and somatic motor (e.g., Parent and Hazrati,  ) behavior. Briefly, cortical eye fields including the FEF and SEF form three major pathways via the basal ganglia to the superior colliculus: the direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathways (see Isoda and Hikosaka,   for a review). The thalamus is known to play a pivotal role in these networks, and the cortical eye fields receive numerous projections from multiple nuclei in the thalamus, which itself receives multiple inputs from the basal ganglia and cerebellum (Tanaka and Kunimatsu,  ). Within the thalamus, activation was obtained across multiple thalamic nuclei including the medial dorsal, ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei. These form part of the paralaminar portion of the thalamus which is important for oculomotor control (see Tanaka and Kunimatsu,   for a review). \n\nActivation in other regions of the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia networks known to be important for oculomotor control, including the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and the superior colliculus itself, was not consistently obtained. These deep small structures can be difficult to image using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) measures, due to the close proximity of these structures to large vasculature (Petit and Beauchamp,  ; Schneider and Kastner,  ). Difficulty in imaging deep structures with BOLD fMRI is only exacerbated with the recent move to higher-dimension arrays (>12 channels) in radiofrequency (RF) head coils (Kaza et al.,  ). Despite these challenges, it is possible to optimize the fMRI acquisition and analysis protocols to robustly detect BOLD changes in deep structures like the superior colliculus (see Wall et al.,   for a review). Acquisition protocols with in-plane voxel sizes of 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 mm at high field strength (> = 3T) have successfully yielded visual and attentional functional activity in the superior colliculus (e.g., Schneider and Kastner,  ; Krebs et al.,  ). Cardiac gating (Guimaraes et al.,  ) and inclusion of cardiac and respiratory signals as covariates of no-interest in first-level models have also shown success (Wall et al.,  ). Lastly, the fMRI signal of deep structures can be improved by optimizing the temporal properties of the modeled hemodynamic response function (HRF) at the first-level for detection of fMRI changes in deep structures (Wall et al.,  ; Krebs et al.,  ). Given the known importance of deep structures in antisaccade performance and oculomotor control more generally, future studies should explore methods to optimize the acquisition and analysis protocols for detection of signals in these regions. \n\n\n### Novel findings \n  \nThe regions discussed so far form the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia networks that have been identified in systematic investigations of oculomotor control in ROI-based studies of the antisaccade task. In addition to these regions, we also found consistent activation in a number of regions not classically linked to oculomotor control. The regions have been reported in antisaccade studies but are rarely commented upon. \n\nAntisaccade vs. prosaccade trials consistently activated the cerebellar tonsil. This activity is outside of the established oculomotor cerebellar network (Robinson and Fuchs,  ) and is located in lobule VI of the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. This lobule has been labeled the   cognitive cerebellum  , and it is involved in a range of cognitive processes, including cognitive control tasks. Spatial tasks in particular activate the left lobule VI (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ). It is interesting that while the cerebellum is known to be critical for effective oculomotor control as demonstrated by lesion and ataxia studies (Robinson and Fuchs,  ), these regions are not consistently reported in fMRI or PET studies of the antisaccade task. It is not clear why this is the case. The oculomotor cerebellum may be equally active for antisaccades, prosaccades, and fixation. However, given the known functional role of the cerebellum this seems unlikely. One possibility is that published studies to date have chosen to focus primarily on cortical and subcortical activation, and cerebellar activations remain under-reported. Indeed, despite its known importance in oculomotor control, no study to date has specifically studied fMRI activity of the cerebellum during the antisaccade task. This represents an important direction for future research. \n\nThe right insula was consistently activated for antisaccades vs. fixation and antisaccades vs. prosaccades. In addition to its well known role in limbic system and the evaluation of pain, functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the insula is active across multiple cognitive domains, including motor, attention, language, and working memory (Kurth et al.,  ). Recently, it has been argued that the insula interacts with the ACC to identify the most behaviorally salient stimuli, initiating attentional control systems to deal with particularly complex and salient environmental demands (Menon and Uddin,  ). Given that antisaccade trials require inhibition of probably one of the most prepotent responses in our behavioral repertoire, the finding that the insula is consistently activated for antisaccades is consistent with this model. \n\nAntisaccade vs. fixation consistently activated the precuneus and supramarginal gyrus; precuneus was also consistently activated in antisaccade greater than prosaccade contrasts. These regions lie on the gyral border of the IPS, and given that the morphology of the IPS is known to vary substantially across individuals, one possibility is that the activation in these regions represents the superior medial and inferior lateral extensions of the oculomotor IPS. Nevertheless, the known functions of these regions is compatible with their consistent activation in the antisaccade task: the precuneus has been linked to visuo-spatial information processes compatible with the vector-inversion process postulated in models of antisaccade performance (Selemon and Goldman-Racic,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Dyckman et al.,  ; Reuter et al.,  ) and the inferior parietal lobule, which contains the supramarginal gyrus, is involved in the coding of motor actions for the control of the eyes (Rizzolatti et al.,  ). Lastly, lingual gyrus and cuneus were consistently activated in antisaccade vs. fixation. These regions are involved in visual processing, and it is possible that their increased activity for antisaccades represents increased demand for complex processing. The cuneus has been implicated in visuo-spatial analysis of the environment for arm reaching and eye movements (Shipp et al.,  ; Galletti et al.,  ; Vanni et al.,  ), and the lingual gyrus has been implicated in color processing (Miceli et al.,  ), which many studies use as cues in the antisaccade task. Alternatively, these regions may be consistently activated because of differences in visual stimulation between antisaccade and fixation, or due to movement of the visual environment on the retina with the eye movement in antisaccade trials. As seen in Table  , these activation foci lay near BA 17 and 18\u2014i.e., near V1 and V2, which is consistent with this interpretation. \n\n\n### Relationship to models of antisaccade and prosaccade performance \n  \nThe results of the current meta-analysis provide quantitative support for the spatial locations of the oculomotor regions discussed in previous reviews and models of antisaccades and prosaccades (e.g., Everling and Fischer,  ; Munoz and Everling,  ; Hutton and Ettinger,  ; Sweeney et al.,  ; McDowell et al.,  ; Isoda and Hikosaka,  ). These models propose that directional and reciprocal connections between these regions underlie correct performance of these tasks. For example, McDowell et al. ( ) argue that visual input enters the brain through the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, to V1\/V2\/V3 in visual cortex, and to the SPL and IPS in parietal cortex. Reciprocal connections between parietal cortex and FEF, SEF, DLPFC, and ACC in the frontal cortex underlie the top-down signals that inhibit the reflexive prosaccade, perform vector inversion to determine the location of the planned antisaccade and initiate the antisaccade response. While the results of the current meta-analysis provide support for the consistent activation of these regions during antisaccade and prosaccade trials, given the nature of the analysis we cannot make firm conclusions on the directionality or the interactions between the brain regions identified here. To do so, formal tests of causal models of the task are required; to our knowledge, only a single study has conducted such an analysis. Using Granger causality, Hwang et al. ( ) identified top-down connections from ACC, right DLPFC and VLPFC to cortical and subcortical oculomotor regions during antisaccade but not prosaccade performance. This study represents an important first step to understanding the causal interactions between the neural regions consistently activated in antisaccades and prosaccades. \n\nSurprisingly, we obtained consistent right VLPFC activity in the antisaccade vs. fixation contrast but not antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast. It is possible that this is related to the fact that most studies that reported the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast used an event-related design (6\/9 studies). In order to achieve an event-related design, it is necessary to randomize trial types within a single run of trials. Such randomization is known to induce task-switching effects (cf. Rogers and Monsell,  ), which can change the cognitive effect of interest. For example, switching between tasks that differ in prepotency may induce asymmetrical switch costs (Allport et al.,  ). Interference models of task switching posit that in order to perform the currently relevant task, the currently irrelevant task must be inhibited (Allport et al.,  ; Mayr and Keele,  ). This task-set inhibition passively dissipates and interferes with subsequent trials. In these models, the increased reaction time and error rate on switch trials occurs because the currently relevant task-set is in a state of inhibition that is carried over from the previous trial. When switching between tasks of unequal difficulty, the prepotent task (here prosaccades) must be strongly inhibited to perform the weaker task (antisaccades). Thus, when switching back to the prepotent task, it is under a high level of inhibition and becomes more difficult to perform. This results in the paradoxical effect that the prepotent task (prosaccade) is more difficult to perform than the weaker task (antisaccade). Asymmetric switch costs have been reported when switching between antisaccades and prosaccades (Mueller et al.,  ). \n\nIt is therefore possible that the requirement to switch tasks in event-related but not blocked designs accounts for one of the surprising findings of this study: right VLPFC was consistently active in the antisaccade vs. fixation contrast but not in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast. The right VLPFC is highly implicated in response inhibition (Aron and Poldrack,  ) and plays a central role in inhibition of the prepotent prosaccade response in cognitive models of the antisaccade task (e.g., Massen,  ). According to these models, response inhibition is required on antisaccade but not prosaccade trials; therefore these models predict strong right VLPFC activity in the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast. In contrast, the asymmetric switch cost phenomenon (Allport et al.,  ) predicts that right VLPFC activity would be larger for the prepotent prosaccade task than the weaker antisaccade task in an event-related design, but larger for antisaccades than prosaccades in a block-design. Two studies included here reported all three contrasts of interest (antisaccade > fixation, prosaccade > fixation, antisaccade > prosaccade) and obtained right VLPFC activity: Aichert et al. ( ; blocked design) and Brown et al. ( ; event-related design). Consistent with models of antisaccade performance (e.g., Massen,  ), Aichert et al. ( ) obtained right VLPFC activity in both antisaccade vs. fixation and antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrasts but   not   in the prosaccade vs. fixation contrast. This suggests that inhibition of the prosaccade response was required to perform antisaccade trials, but inhibition of the antisaccade response was not required to perform prosaccade trials. In contrast, Brown et al. ( ) obtained right VLPFC activity in the antisaccade vs. fixation contrast but   not   the antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast. Importantly, right VLPFC was also activated in the prosaccade vs. fixation contrast, consistent with the argument that inhibition of the prosaccade response was required to perform the antisaccade task, and inhibition of the antisaccade response was required to perform the prosaccade task. Thus, when contrasting the two tasks (antisaccade > prosaccade), activation was no longer above threshold in the right VLPFC. \n\nThis comparison of results from Aichert et al. ( ) and Brown et al. ( ) is consistent with the argument that right VLPFC activity was not obtained in the meta-analysis of antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast, due to the requirement to inhibit the currently relevant task in both antisaccade and prosaccade trials in event-related designs. Note that this account does not preclude the possibility of obtaining right VLPFC activity in antisaccade vs. prosaccade contrast, rather it suggests that it may be canceled out if right VLPFC shows similar levels of activation in prosaccades and antisaccades. If right VLPFC is active in both antisaccade and prosaccade trials, but is active to a greater extent in antisaccade trials, some right VLPFC activity may still be obtained, as in Chickazoe et al. ( ). Admittedly, this account is highly speculative, and represents an important direction for future research. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions and directions for future research \n  \nThe motivation for the current meta-analysis was to examine the regions most consistently activated by the antisaccade task. The major cortical areas known to be important for oculomotor control were consistently activated to a greater extent for antisaccades than prosaccades, including the FEF, SEF, IPS, DLPFC, and ACC. Some, but not all of the major subcortical regions known to be implicated in cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia oculomotor networks were consistently activated, including the striatum and thalamus; activation in other regions such as superior colliculus, substantia nigra and globus pallidus was not obtained, possibly due to artifacts and signal loss in deep areas in close proximity to the vasculature. Also, the smoothing required by ALE may dilute the effect sizes in these small structures. In addition to these oculomotor regions, a number of regions not classically associated with oculomotor control, but often involved in tasks of attention, cognitive control, and visuospatial transformations were consistently active in antisaccade trials, including cerebellar tonsil, precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, insula, lingual gyrus, and cuneus. The finding that classic oculomotor cerebellar regions were not consistently activated during any of the contrasts of interest warrants further investigation. \n\nAn important direction for future research regards the experimental design of the antisaccade task. Approximately half the studies used a block design whilst the remainder used an event-related design. Block designs are optimal to study sustained activation in response to a task across multiple trials, whereas event-related designs are optimal to study transient activity in response to single trials. Thus, both designs are indexing different components of the task. Additionally, the requirement to randomize trial types to achieve an event-related design can induce task-switching effects (Rogers and Monsell,  ) and thus asymmetric switch costs (Allport et al.,  ), changing the cognitive effect of interest. Similarly, randomizing tasks of differing difficulty can induce sequence effects that also change the underlying cognitive process of interest (Jamadar et al.,  ), and manipulating the local probability of an antisaccade or prosaccade task can also affect antisaccade performance (Chiau et al.,  ). Randomizing antisaccade and prosaccade trials affects the magnitude of activation particularly on frontal regions such as the DLPFC and ACC (Dyckman et al.,  ; Manoach et al.,  ) and may affect activity in the right VLPFC (see section Relationship to Models of Antisaccade and Prosaccade Performance). Other manipulations of the basic cognitive paradigm to make it suitable for event-related fMRI can also change the cognitive process of interest (see Ruge et al.,   for a discussion of the effects of experimental design on cognitive processing). Given the small number of studies eligible for inclusion in the current meta-analysis, the current study could not examine differences between blocked and event-related designs. With the publication of further studies, future meta-analyses should endeavor to examine such differences. \n\nAn important limitation of this study, which is common to all meta-analyses is publication bias (Ferguson and Branick, 2011). Additionally, a large proportion of the studies identified during the systematic search did not report results from voxel-wise analyses, and thus the results reflect consistency of activity across a reduced selection of studies but not for all existing fMRI studies of the task. Note, however, that meta-analysis of even as few as two studies is considered a meaningful analysis, as it can increase the precision of estimates as much as 30% (Cumming,  ). A possible limitation is that those studies that did report voxel-wise results may have not optimized their scanning protocols to fully cover the cerebellum for all subjects: it is common practice when acquiring the data to align the scan so as to fully cover cortical (premotor) areas which sometimes exclude the most ventral parts the cerebellum in subjects whose brains are larger than the FOV. Lastly, our use of an FDR correction is considered conservative compared to other thresholding procedures (e.g., cluster-level correction; Chumbley et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). We feel that this is acceptable as Chumbley et al., and Eickhoff et al.'s results suggest this is likely to have resulted in smaller activation clusters compared to cluster-level thresholds, rather than yielding false positives or negatives. Despite these limitations, this study establishes that the antisaccade task robustly and consistently activates a broad range of oculomotor regions, making it particularly suitable for the study of endophenotypes and biomarkers for psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., Jablensky,  ; Ritsner and Gottesman,  ; Fielding et al.,  ,  ). In addition, the meta-analytic activation maps we report here will be of value for decision neuroscience research, where oculomotor processes are increasingly of interest (e.g., Schall,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, the current meta-analysis established the most consistent activation in fMRI studies of the antisaccade and prosaccade tasks, revealing a number of regions that are consistently active to a greater extent for antisaccade than prosaccade trials. While the number of studies eligible to be included in this meta-analysis was small and the results should thus be considered preliminary, the results of this systematic review reveal that antisaccade and prosaccade trials consistently activate a distributed network of regions both within and outside the classic definition of the oculomotor network. We suggest that future studies should acquire whole-brain functional images and report voxel-wise results to make the literature more amenable to meta-analysis. In this way, future systematic reviews can conduct meta-analytic contrasts and\/or meta-regressions across studies. Future studies relying on ROIs to study antisaccade-related fMRI can use the regions identified here to construct functional ROIs and eliminate the need for functional localizer scans whilst also allowing ROI definitions to be based on larger samples than routinely recruited in functional studies. Interested researchers can download masks of the regions identified here for use as ROI definitions from  . \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3797465,"text_md5":"86fe1e1e0441c4f00791e82329ce50d6","field_positions":{"authors":[0,57],"journal":[58,71],"publication_year":[73,77],"title":[88,255],"keywords":[269,406],"abstract":[419,2369],"body":[2378,53360]},"batch":1,"pmid":24137150,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2013.00749","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3797465","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3797465"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3797465\">3797465<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3797465  Quantitative meta-analysis of fMRI and PET studies reveals consistent activation in fronto-striatal-parietal regions and cerebellum during antisaccades and prosaccades"}

Studies using\ntask-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe neural\ndysfunction in irritability have increased. However, an integrated review\nsummarizing the published methods and synthesized fMRI results remains\nlacking. \n\n\n## Method: \n  \nWe conducted a systematic search using irritability terms and task\nfunctional neuroimaging in key databases in March 2021, and identified 30\nstudies for our systematic review. Sample characteristics and fMRI methods\nwere summarized. A subset of 28 studies met the criteria for extracting\ncoordinate-based data for quantitative meta-analysis. Ten\nactivation-likelihood estimations were performed to examine neural\nconvergence across irritability measures and fMRI task domains. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nSystematic review revealed small sample sizes (median = 58, mean age\nrange = 8\u201316 years) with heterogeneous sample characteristics,\nirritability measures, tasks, and analytical procedures. Meta-analyses found\nno evidence for neural activation convergence of irritability across\nneurocognitive functions related to emotional reactivity, cognitive control,\nand reward processing, or within each domain. Sensitivity analyses\npartialing out variances driven by heterogeneous tasks, irritability\nmeasures, stimulus types, and developmental ages all yielded null findings.\nResults were compared with a review on irritability-related structural\nanomalies from 11 studies. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nThe lack of neural convergence suggests a need for common,\nstandardized irritability assessments and more homogeneous fMRI tasks.\nThoughtfully designed fMRI studies probing commonly defined neurocognitive\nfunctions may be more fruitful to elucidate the neural mechanisms of\nirritability. Open science practices, data mining in large neuroscience\ndatabases, and standardized analytical methods promote meaningful\ncollaboration in irritability research. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nChildhood irritability (hereafter, irritability), an elevated proneness to anger\nrelative to peers,  has received increased attention in child\npsychiatry in the last decade. Irritability is characterized by frequent,\ndevelopmentally inappropriate temper outbursts, low frustration tolerance, and\/or\nirritable and negative mood.  With an estimated community prevalence of 0.12%\nto 5%,  epidemiological studies have\nshown that the negative mental health and life outcomes of irritability extend into\nadulthood,  predicting risks of\nmajor affective symptoms and disorders (eg, anxious and depressed symptoms)  and suicidal ideation\/attempts.  Although irritability is a hallmark feature of disruptive mood\ndysregulation disorder (DMDD), it is a transdiagnostic symptom commonly co-occurring\nwith major psychiatric conditions in youths, including attention-deficit\/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum\ndisorder (ASD). This highlights the need to study the neural mechanisms of irritability,\nwhich may have treatment implications for many pediatric disorders in which irritability\noccurs. \n\nOver the past decade, many attempts have been made at progress probing the\nneural mechanisms of irritability using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nMost of these fMRI studies investigated the brain\u2013behavior association between\nirritability symptoms and task-related blood-oxygenation\u2013dependent\nsignals.  The\ncurrent integrated review focused on 3 neurocognitive domains in irritability, namely\nemotional reactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Brotman   et\nal.   proposed a\ntranslational neuroscience model of irritability that outlined 2 neural and\/or\nbehavioral pathways of irritability\u2014threat processing and reward processing.\nEvidence for the threat processing pathway showed that when presented with potentially\nthreatening emotional stimuli (eg, angry and fearful facial expressions), youths with\nhigh irritability symptoms and those diagnosed with marked irritability (eg, DMDD)\nshowed aberrant reactivity in subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, insula, and\nthalamus, relative to typically developing peers.  These aberrant\nneural responses are thought to reflect heightened threat responding in youths with high\nirritability.  Here, the term \u201cemotion\nreactivity\u201d was used, given that task fMRI studies in the field commonly compare\nneural responses to threat or negatively valenced stimuli vs positive and\/or neutral\nstimuli. \n\nMost evidence for the reward processing pathway was grounded in frustrative\nnonreward, a negative valence construct in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)  matrix. When the omission of expected\nreward elicits frustration, youths with high irritability showed aberrant neural\nresponses in fronto-striatal regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyri, and\ncaudate, compared to typically developing youths.  Other studies also\ntested reward processing without the use of a rigged reward schedule to evoke\nfrustration, and reported less consistent results in the frontal  and temporal  gyri. Together, aberrant fronto-striatal responses, notably\nthose elicited by frustrative nonreward, are conceptualized as deficits in\nreward-related processing underlying irritability. \n\nA smaller body of task fMRI studies investigated cognitive\ncontrol\u2013related functions, probing the top-down regulation and coordination of\ncognitive processes. These studies have found that youths with high irritability\nsymptoms showed inhibitory deficits, and that irritability symptom severity was\nassociated with aberrant activation in the superior frontal and temporal gyri, inferior\nfrontal gyri, and anterior cingulate cortices during inhibitory control tasks.  According to the exposure-targeted model of irritability,  cognitive control functions facilitate\ntop-down regulation of frustration and outburst behaviors, which are promising targets\nfor intervention. \n\nAlthough these results are promising, there are overlapping as well as distinct\nregions across these individual fMRI studies targeting different neurocognitive domains.\nIt remains largely unknown whether there are convergent neural responses in specific\nregions that reflect shared neural mechanisms of irritability across threat-responding,\nfrustrative nonreward processing and cognitive control. Also, many past studies had\nsmall sample sizes, and variations in research designs (eg, diagnostic groups,\nirritability measures, dimensional vs categorical conceptualization of irritability,\nexperimental paradigms) may limit the generalizability of results and contribute to\nheterogeneous findings across individual studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis to synthesize the irritability fMRI studies published to date,\nto consolidate the current state of knowledge and to identify neural correlates of\nirritability that are robust to variations in task validity and study designs. \n\nMethodological issues aside, age and sex differences are relatively neglected in\nthe irritability fMRI literature. There is increasing advocacy for attending to\ndevelopmental differences in pediatric neuroimaging, as developmental stage may moderate\nsocio-affective brain functions. \nFronto-striatal dysfunction following frustrative nonreward was found to be more\npronounced in youths with irritability in mid-childhood and early adolescence, compared\nto late adolescence.  However, it\nremains largely unclear whether the neural correlates of irritability differ as youths\ntransition from one developmental stage to another (eg, from late childhood to early\nadolescence when prefrontal circuitries important for mood regulation develop\nmarkedly).  Similarly,\nalthough research attending to sex differences in irritability symptoms and\nclassification is emerging, \nirritability studies investigating sex differences in task-dependent neural responses\nare scarce. \n\nThe current integrated review has 3 major aims. First, we present a systematic\nreview of task fMRI studies focusing on neural activation associated with irritability\nand related constructs (eg, reactive aggression, anger) in children and adolescents aged\n6 to 18 years, the most common age range sampled in the literature of fMRI research in\nirritability. By summarizing the sample characteristics and methodological aspects of\nthe studies, we provide an overview of the task fMRI study designs. We also summarize\nthe past studies on age and sex differences in the neural correlates of irritability.\nSecond, we conduct a quantitative meta-analysis based on a subset of qualified task fMRI\nstudies to identify the most robust neural correlates of irritability across\nneurocognitive domains, that is, those with high convergence across all individual\nstudies. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the neural mechanisms of\nirritability, we also examine the extent to which these neural correlates converge\nspecifically within each of the neurocognitive domains examined, namely, emotion\nreactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Third, we conduct sensitivity\nanalyses to identify potential sources of nonconvergence by systematically removing\nvariances due to study heterogeneity (eg, irritability measurements, dimensional vs\ncategorical conceptualization of irritability, age differences). We discuss the\nsynthesized results in the context of existing neuroscience-informed models of\nirritability,  and provide recommendations for future\nneuroimaging studies on irritability. \n\n## METHOD \n  \n### Identification of Task fMRI Studies \n  \nA systematic search was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines  to identify potential task fMRI studies\nfor the purpose of this review and meta-analysis. Importantly, we conceptualized\nirritability using a transdiagnostic approach, imposing no restrictions on the\ndiagnostic categories of the samples recruited and irritability measures used in\nthe task fMRI studies. Yet, to capture the irritability phenotype as\nconceptualized, we focused on constructs with marked or highly associated\nfeatures of irritability, which included anger, reactive aggression, and mood\ndysregulation.  Such conceptualization hence gave rise to the following\nsearch terms and their derivatives: (((irritability) OR (anger) OR (reactive\naggression) OR (dysregulation)) AND ((child*) OR (adolescent*)) AND ((fMRI) OR\n(functional magnetic resonance imaging))), which were used to search for\npeer-reviewed task-fMRI journal articles published in English, from January 2000\nto March 2021. The systematic search was run in PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, and\nWeb of Science. To ensure that the search included all the key fMRI studies of\ninterest, the identified list of articles was cross-checked with a recent\nnarrative review on the neural dysfunctions of irritability.  Details of the screening procedures and\ninformation regarding the exclusion of articles were outlined in the PRISMA flow\nchart ( ). After independent screening, in-depth reading of full\narticles, and consensus meetings with senior authors, a final collection of 30\narticles were included in the systematic review ( ), 28 of which included\nwhole-brain analyses and thus qualified for the quantitative meta-analysis. The\nidentified studies were published between 2009 and 2021, 20 of which were\npublished after 2015. Upon independent data extraction, 3 of the 28 studies were\nfurther excluded from the main quantitative meta-analysis because significant\nclusters were found in the ROI analysis only,  no significant clusters were reported\nfor any task interaction effects with irritability independent of age,  and only significant main\neffects of irritability were found.  This resulted in a final collection of 25 task fMRI\nstudies for the main coordinate-based meta-analysis. A detailed summary of the\nrelevant findings and coordinates extracted from the task fMRI studies can be\nfound in  \nand  , available\nonline. Coordinates were converted to and reported in the Montreal Neurological\nInstitute space using the Yale BioImage Suite. The current review and\nmeta-analysis was registered with the PROSPERO ID: CRD42021253757. \n\n\n### Systematic Review \n  \nTo provide an overview of the task fMRI studies, we first summarized the\nsample characteristics and key fMRI methodologies reported in the studies. For\nsample characteristics, we extracted the full and subsample sizes, diagnosis,\npercentage of male participants, recruitment site, average age and age range,\nand irritability measure used. For fMRI methodologies, we coded whether the\nstudies conducted whole-brain or region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, specific\nregions of interest (if applicable), fMRI tasks and their neurocognitive domains\nprobed (emotion reactivity, cognitive control, reward processing), and\nstatistical thresholds for conducting those analyses. For emotion reactivity, we\ncategorized studies that used experimental paradigms that involve the perception\nof and\/or engagement with emotional stimuli. Examples are fMRI tasks that invite\nparticipants to view emotional facial expressions or to perform a computer game\ndesigned to elicit anger and frustration. For cognitive control, we grouped\nstudies with paradigms that demand top-down executive functions, such as tasks\nrequiring participants to inhibit one\u2019s behavior and orient one\u2019s\nattention with respect to task demands. For reward processing, we identified\nfMRI tasks that require participants to engage in reward-driven behaviors, often\nimplemented in a game-like setting along with a reward scheme. We acknowledged\nthat these neurocognitive domains are not completely independent of each other,\nand it is common that some fMRI tasks might be classified into more than one\nneurocognitive domain, such as the Affective Posner Task.  Nonetheless, organizing studies by neurocognitive domains\nallowed for imposing a systematic framework and increasing study availability\nfor the subgroup quantitative meta-analyses, which are insightful for guiding\nfuture research. Moreover, we coded whether sex differences were examined. It\nshould be noted that 2 of the 30 studies included in the systematic review did\nnot qualify for subsequent data extraction for the quantitative meta-analysis\nbecause whole-brain analyses were not conducted.  Still, a qualitative summary of the sample characteristics\nand fMRI methodologies of these studies was deemed informative for future\nrecruitment and study design. \n\n\n### Quantitative Meta-Analysis \n  \nRandom effects activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was conducted in\nGingerALE version 3.0.2. \nPeak coordinates of the relevant contrasts were extracted from the task fMRI\nstudies and entered to the software, deriving activation likelihood estimates\nfor each voxel. Analyses were conducted where there were adequate numbers of\nexperiments (k = 17) as recommended by Eickhoff   et\nal.  \nHowever, ad justments were made to allow for subgroup analyses of the various\nneurocognitive dimensions due to study availability.  For these subgroup analyses, a minimum\nof 8 to 10 studies were required to produce valid results while balancing the\nneed for synthesized fMRI findings with statistical rigor. \n\nFor our main analysis, a within-group analysis was first conducted using\nall available task fMRI studies (k = 25, 167 foci). Following published\nguidelines and previous meta-analyses,  statistical significance of the\n  p  -value maps was set at a cluster-level inference corrected\nthreshold of   p   < .05, with 1,000 thresholding\npermutations and an uncorrected   p   < .001. Because\nincluding all available contrasts from the identified studies would introduce\nwithin-group effects from those that reported alternative analyses of similar\ncontrasts, which could affect the Modeled Activation (MA) values in the software\nalgorithm,  we carefully selected the more\ninterpretable and relevant contrast(s) with respect to the study\u2019s key\nresearch interest (eg, angry vs neutral faces for facial emotion processing\nstudies ; reward vs\nnonreward conditions during reward anticipation, and performance feedback\nconditions wherever possible for reward-processing studies).  For studies that reported more than one\nrelevant contrast with the same control condition (eg, negative faces vs shapes\nand positive faces vs shapes ), the respective coordinates were pooled as one experiment as\nrecommended.  Given that more studies reported significant\ntask-related neural responses when analyzing parent-reported (k = 4) than\nchild-reported (k = 1) irritability symptoms alone, we prioritized contrasts\nbased on parent report to reduce informant-related variances across individual\nstudies. To gain deeper insight into the functional significance of the neural\naberrations associated with irritability, 3 subgroup analyses were conducted\nseparately for each neurocognitive domain defined previously. These included\nemotion reactivity (k = 19, 138 foci), cognitive control (k = 9, 73 foci), and\nreward processing (k = 7, 52 foci). \n\nSeven sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, to supplement the main\nanalysis, we increased the study pool by adding the study by Chaarani   et\nal.  ,  who\nconducted a whole-brain structural analysis but only found significant clusters\nassociated with irritability symptoms in the follow-up functional ROI analysis\n(resulting in a total k = 26, 170 foci). Second, we conducted an analysis\nrestricting to only emotional reactivity studies that used facial emotional\nprocessing tasks or involved facial emotion stimuli (k = 12, 92 foci), given the\nrelatively large number of such tasks, to reduce task heterogeneity in the\nemotional reactivity domain. Third, 2 measurement sensitivity analyses were\nperformed, restricting analyses to studies assessing irritability using the\nAffective Reactivity Index (ARI)  (k = 10, 90 foci) and diagnostic modules focused on\nirritability (ie, severe mood dysregulation [SMD] and DMDD modules) from the\nKiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)  (k = 8, 59 foci), respectively. These measurement\nanalyses would provide important insights into the potential divergence of\nneural correlates regarding a dimensional vs categorical conceptualization of\nirritability. Relatedly, a phenotype sensitivity analysis was performed by\ncombining the ARI studies with the K-SADS studies (k = 17, 137 foci). A\ndevelopmental sensitivity analysis was conducted in studies with a mean sample\nage of less than 15 years (k = 22, 167 foci). We increased the study pool of\nthis sensitivity analysis by adding the work of Karim   et\nal.  ,  who\nfound significant clusters for an irritability by age interaction in a\nmid-childhood sample (mean age = 7.6 years). Study availability precluded us\nfrom conducting an ALE-based subtraction analysis with studies that sampled mid-\nto late-adolescents (k = 4). Finally, to evaluate the impact of sample size, we\nran a sensitivity analysis that included only studies with sample sizes greater\nthan the overall median sample size (N > 58; k = 12, 90 foci). Of note,\nalthough these sensitivity analyses helped to reduce heterogeneity, some of\nthese analyses and the subgroup analyses for cognitive control and reward\nprocessing had small numbers of studies and might not capture subtle effects\nbecause of limited power. These results should be interpreted with caution. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \n#### Sample Characteristics. \n    \nSample size and age. Across all studies included in the\nsystematic review (k = 30), the average sample size was 87\nparticipants (median = 58, SD = 66.89, range = 19\u2013320). The\nnumber was comparable (mean = 82, median = 55, SD = 68.51, range =\n19\u2013320) when selecting the most relevant clinical groups with\nmarked irritability symptoms (eg, DMDD and SMD) for studies that\nfocused on diagnostic group comparisons without dimensional\nmeasures. In terms of age, 26 studies recruited pre- and\nmid-adolescents with mean ages below 15 years (mean = 13.12, median\n= 13.8, SD = 1.89, range = 7.6\u201314.9), whereas only 4 studies\nrecruited late-adolescents aged >15 years (mean = 15.45,\nmedian = 15.5, SD = 0.3, range = 15.1\u201315.7). \n  \nSex proportion. The average proportion of male participants\nwas 61.1% (median = 54.9%, SD = 18.62), ranging from 33.9% to 100%\n(4 studies had male participants only). \n  \nRecruitment. Most study samples were recruited from research\nfacilities with clinical services, such as the National Institute of\nMental Health (NIMH) (k = 14), Yale Child Study Center (k = 2), and\nlocal psychiatric units (k = 5). Four studies sampled youths who\nwere seeking treatment and at risk for developing significant\nirritability symptoms in the local community. \nTwo studies assessed irritability symptoms more broadly in healthy\ncommunity samples. \nThree studies constituted part of a large-scale research project\n(EU-Aggressotype and EU-MATRICS project,  Bipolar Offspring\nStudy, \nand IMAGEN ).\nBased on this summary, it is plausible that several studies might\nhave recruited their samples from the same source (eg, NIMH) and\nthat there might be overlapping subjects across these studies. \n  \nSocioeconomic status and race\/ethnicity. Only 7 studies\nprovided socioeconomic information of the sample, most of whom were\nfrom mid- to high-income households and with parents attaining high\nschool or degree-level education. Eight studies reported\nrace\/ethnicity; 6 of those studies recruited primarily White\nparticipants (mean = 64.6%, median = 62.8%, SD = 13.55, range = 50%\nto 80.4%), whereas 2 studies recruited predominantly\nHispanic\/Latinx  and Black  participants. \n  \nDiagnosis. The samples included multiple clinical\/research\ndiagnoses: ADHD (n = 207, k = 8), DMDD (n = 199, k = 5), BD (n =\n183, k = 7), SMD (n = 165, k = 8), anxiety (n = 152, k = 4), and ASD\n(n = 116, k = 3), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and\/or\nconduct disorder (CD; n = 108, k = 1). \n  \nIrritability measures. Three categories of irritability\nmeasures were observed. Ten studies assessed diagnostic categories\nwith marked irritability symptoms using the K-SADS in their main\nanalyses.  For dimensional\napproaches, 10 studies assessed irritability symptoms using the\nARI, \nwhereas 10 other studies used other dimensional measures assessing\nclinical features associated with irritability symptoms, such as the\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL), \nReactive\u2013Proactive Aggression Questionnaire,  and Child\/Adolescent Symptom\nInventory. \n  \n\n\n### fMRI Methods \n    \nfMRI tasks. A wide array of experimental tasks were used to\nprobe neural dysfunction pertinent to irritability. Of the 30 studies,\n22 studies focused on emotional reactivity, 14 of which involved the\nperception of and\/or engagement with emotional facial stimuli.  Seven studies probing reward\nprocessing included mostly the Monetary Incentive Delay Task,  the Affective Posner Task,  and other point-based tasks.  Eleven studies probing cognitive\ncontrol encompassed various subdomains of cognitive control functions in\nirritability, such as inhibitory control on the Stop Signal\nTask  and Flanker\nTask, \nreversal learning, \nand attention control processes.  Some studies involving emotional\nreactivity  and reward\nprocessing \nalso probed attention processes (eg, attention orienting). \n  \nfMRI analytical thresholds. Heterogeneous analytical thresholds\nwere observed across studies. Most analytical thresholds used in the\nwhole-brain analyses were voxelwise corrected (k = 18). Other correction\nmethods included those based on familywise error rate (k = 5) and false\ndiscovery rate (k = 1). Four studies reported uncorrected alpha levels.\nFor ROI analyses, similar to whole-brain, most thresholds were not\nclearly stated (k = 10). Other correction methods for ROI included those\nbased on cluster-extent (k = 2), Bonferroni correction (k = 2),\nfamilywise error rate (k = 1), false discovery rate (k = 1), and\nvoxelwise correction (k = 1). \n  \nSex differences. Of the 30 studies, only 5 studies examined sex\ndifferences in the task-dependent neural correlates of irritability;\nalmost all yielded no significant findings ( , available\nonline), except for 2 studies that reported a main effect of sex in the\nleft amygdala  and\nincreased activation in several regions important for salience detection\nduring frustrative nonreward processing in younger boys (eg, insula and\npre-\/post-central gyri).  Seventeen studies did not report analyzing sex as a\ncovariate or sex by irritability interaction in their analyses. The 8\nstudies that analyzed sex as a covariate yielded mostly null findings;\nonly one study found sex differences in the salience network during\ninhibitory control, such as the thalamus and cingulate. \n  \n\n### Meta-Analysis: No Evidence for Convergent Neural Correlates of\nIrritability \n  \n#### Main and Subgroup Analyses. \n  \nThe main analysis inclusive of 25 task fMRI studies of irritability\n(167 foci) across all neurocognitive domains revealed no clusters of\nconvergence.   visualizes the\nunthresholded positive   z  -score map. The 3 subsequent\nsubgroup analyses focusing on 19 fMRI tasks (138 foci) probing emotional\nreactivity, 9 fMRI tasks (73 foci) probing cognitive control, and 7 fMRI\ntasks (52 foci) probing reward processing, respectively, all revealed no\nevidence for convergence within domain, suggesting that the null finding in\nthe main analysis was not driven by heterogeneity in tasks across\nneurocognitive domains. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity Analyses. \n  \nAs outlined earlier, 7 sensitivity analyses were conducted. Given\nthe null findings above, sensitivity analyses may help identify potential\nsources of nonconvergence by systematically removing variances contributed\nby study heterogeneity. In the first sensitivity analysis adding ROI\ncoordinates from the work by Chaarani   et al.   to increase the study pool\n(k = 26, 170 foci) and hence power, no convergent clusters were found.\nSecond, restricting the analysis to the emotional face tasks only (k = 12,\n92 foci) revealed no clusters of convergence. Third, the measurement\nsensitivity analyses also found no evidence for convergence within the 10\nstudies (90 foci) that dimensionally indexed irritability with the ARI, and\nwithin the 8 studies (59 foci) that analyzed diagnostic categories with\nmarked irritability on the K-SADS. The phenotype sensitivity analysis (k =\n17, 137 foci) aggregating the ARI studies and the K-SADS studies (which\ncharacterized marked irritability using the SMD and DMDD modules) yielded\nnull results. The developmental sensitivity analysis on 22 studies (167\nfoci) with a mean age of <15 years produced no convergent findings.\nFinally, the sensitivity analysis on 12 studies (90 foci) with at least a\nmedian sample size of 58 participants also yielded null results. \n\n\n#### Descriptive ROI Findings. \n  \nOf the 25 studies qualified for the meta-analysis, 15 studies also\nconducted ROI analyses investigating the association of irritability symptom\nseverity with and\/or irritability group differences in task-dependent neural\nresponses in   a priori   defined brain regions. The\nhypothesized regions comprised regions in the salience network underlying\nthe threat-processing pathway (eg, amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate\ncortex) and fronto-striatal regions (eg, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate,\nnucleus accumbens, and putamen) underlying the reward-processing pathway in\nirritability.  Six\nof the 15 studies (7 foci) reported significant irritability-related ROI\nfindings. Notably, 2 of 3 studies found youths with high irritability\nshowing increased activation during reward processing  and decreased activation during a reversal learning\ntask  in the\ncaudate; 2 of 3 studies found increased putamen activation in youths with\nhigh irritability during reward processing tasks.  Despite the postulated role of the amygdala in\nmediating aberrant threat responding in irritability, only 2 of 12 studies\nfound increased amygdala responses in youths with high irritability during\nemotional face tasks.  presents a summary of the ROI\nfindings. \n\n\n\n### Relevant Structural MRI Literature \n  \nGiven that the main meta-analyses showed no convergent results among the\nfMRI studies, a comparison with the structural MRI literature may be helpful to\nclarify whether the null results were partly related to poor fMRI task validity.\nWe conducted a systematic review in the structural MRI literature using the same\nirritability search terms and identified 11 studies ( , available online).\nSample characteristics and key findings were summarized ( , available online). Of the\n11 studies, 8 studies examined gray and white matter volumes, 5 of which found\nreduced volumes in widely distributed frontal regions, including the inferior\nfrontal gyrus and prefrontal regions, whereas 3 studies reported reduced insular\nvolume. Findings on cortical thickness and surface area were inconclusive. This\nstructural review was not preregistered. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first integrated and meta-analytic synthesis\nof task fMRI findings in youths with irritability. We followed the latest\nrecommendations on coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis, \nand found no evidence for convergence in the irritability fMRI literature either in\nthe main analysis across neurocognitive task domains or in the subgroup analyses for\nemotion reactivity, reward processing, and cognitive control. Further sensitivity\nanalyses restricting studies by stimulus type, dimensional and categorical\nirritability measures, irritability phenotype, and developmental ages also revealed\nno significant convergence across studies. The absence of neural convergence might\nstem from marked heterogeneity in clinical characteristics, small samples, and\nvariations in fMRI task design, irritability measurements, and statistical\nprocedures, such as thresholding, across individual studies. Moreover, a descriptive\nsummary of ROI results suggested altered neural responses during reward tasks in the\ncaudate and putamen associated with high irritability, consistent with the striatal\nreward processing pathway of irritability. \n\n### Heterogeneous Irritability Samples \n  \nAlthough the mean sample size (N = 87) seemed moderate for neuroimaging\nresearch, we noticed considerable variability in the sample sizes; indeed, the\nmedian sample size (N = 58) was small across studies. Small sample size not only\nreduces the power to detect subtle effects, which are common for tasks probing\nsocio-affective processing, \nbut also may result in inflated estimates, hampering the generalizability of the\nneuroimaging findings. All of these could contribute to the lack of convergence\nin the past fMRI studies in irritability. \n\nMyriad clinical conditions, including DMDD\/SMD, ADHD, ASD, ODD, anxiety,\nand BD, were included in the reviewed studies, which highlights the\ntransdiagnostic feature of irritability. This raises the critical question as to\nwhat extent irritability is mediated by similar neural mechanisms across\ndiagnostic categories. We attempted to address this by restricting irritability\nphenotypes in our sensitivity analysis, yet yielded nonconvergence. Still, as in\nmany other phenotypes in psychiatry, heterogeneity in irritability is a clinical\nreality and a challenging issue in fMRI research. Heterogeneous clinical\nfeatures and developmental differences in the irritability phenotype might\ninteract with neurobiological alterations. Even within youths with irritability\nbut without comorbid conditions, there are variances in irritability symptom\npresentation, which may have different etiological pathways and may be mediated\nby different brain alterations. For instance, research has started to show that\nirritable mood (tonic irritability) and temper outbursts (phasic irritability)\nrelate to different genetic and environmental influences in DMDD,  as well as psychiatric risks\n(eg, ADHD,  depressive\ndisorders, and anxiety disorders ). These intricate dimensions are not well captured in the\ncurrent irritability measures. Novel methods and measurements indexing these\nsymptom dimensions in a more fine-grained manner needs to be developed (eg,\necological momentary assessment) and tested for their psychometric properties,\nwhich will facilitate future studies parsing the neurobiological underpinnings\nof different aspects of irritability (eg, tonic vs phasic irritability). \n\nMoreover, youths with clinical diagnoses are likely to receive\npsychotropic medications or psychotherapy and\/or to have environmental risk\nfactors, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and adverse childhood\nexperiences,  which\nhave been shown to alter socio-affective brain functions mediating affective\nsymptoms and regulation. \nHowever, comprehensive reporting of sample socioeconomic status and\nrace\/ethnicity information is rare in the field (ie, <30% of the studies\nreviewed here). Among the studies that reported this sociodemographic\ninformation, the majority included predominantly White participants from mid- to\nhigh-income households with parents attaining high school or degree-level\neducation, whereas only 2 studies recruited predominantly\nHispanic\/Latinx  and\nBlack  participants,\nand only one study included youths with trauma histories.  Thus, the generalizability of the past\nfindings to diverse, representative populations is unclear. Future studies\nshould include more diverse samples, report sociodemographic composition of the\nstudy samples, and evaluate and discuss how the sociodemographic sample\ncharacteristics affect their findings. Importantly, more research is needed to\nexamine the impact of early life adversity and trauma on the etiology and\ndevelopment of childhood irritability, as youths from marginalized and adverse\nbackgrounds represent one of the most vulnerable groups to develop irritability\nsymptoms and deserve timely intervention. \n\nStudies differ in irritability measures. The most commonly used\ndimensional measures is the ARI,  whereas the most widely adopted categorical measure is\nirritability-related modules (ie, DMDD, ODD, SMD) on the K-SADS. Some other\nmeasures included selected items on the CBCL  and Reactive Proactive\nQuestionnaire.  Although dimensional measures\nare more sensitive in capturing individual differences in irritability symptoms\nand are well suited for sensitivity analyses partialing out comorbidity-related\nvariances, categorical approaches allow for identifying the most significant\nneural correlates in youths with severe forms of irritability warranting\nclinical attention. Still, there is no gold standard for assessing irritability,\nand these various measures of irritability differ in measurement validity,\nreliability, and informant agreement across development.  None of the existing measures are sensitive to\nlow-to-modest irritability symptoms \u2014an issue highly relevant for typically\ndeveloping and\/or community samples. More justification in the choice of\nirritability assessments is preferable, as irritability-related subscales or\nitems extracted from larger pools, compared to those specifically designed for\nassessing irritability, might vary psychometrically and relate subtly to\ndifferent aspects of neural dysregulation.  This relates\nto the previous discussion on characterizing the different aspects of\nirritability, as increasing studies rely on latent variable techniques  or individual assessment items  to index tonic and phasic irritability, but their\npsychometric properties await critical evaluation. \n\nLow study availability precluded us from examining age- and sex-related\ndifferences in neural convergence. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis\nfocusing on pre- and early-adolescents only (<15 years of age) and found\nno convergent results. Thus, questions remain as to whether age- and sex-related\npubertal and hormonal changes might have contributed to the null results, as\nrecent evidence points to an interplay between pubertal hormones and maturation\nof fronto-limbic circuitries,  overlapping with the threat and reward processing pathways\nof irritability.  Studies that\ndirectly examined sex moderation on irritability-related neural responses are\nscarce, with only one study finding significant sex moderation effects during\nfrustrative nonreward processing.  Together with studies that analyzed sex as a covariate or\nmain effect,  these sex differences emerged primarily\nin the salience network. \n\n\n### Heterogeneous fMRI Tasks and Analytical Procedures \n  \nOur null findings contrast with the few recent coordinate-based fMRI\nmeta-analyses on irritability-related constructs. For instance, 2 meta-analyses\nfound that state anger (k = 39)  and anger experience (k = 26)  were associated with activations in the\nanterior insula\/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex,  and in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.  In a more relevant\nmeta-analysis (k = 68), \nfrustrative nonreward processing was associated with deactivation in the\norbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum, and\nheightened activation in the midcingulo-insular regions. It is thought that the\ndeactivation patterns represent frontal neural deficiency, which disinhibits\naggressive responding to frustrative events.  These meta-analyses, however, were performed in\nprimarily healthy young adults, with a larger collection of studies using more\nhomogeneous tasks. Therefore, such spatial convergence might not generalize to\ndevelopmental clinical groups (childhood irritability in this case) in which\nneural convergence is a complex function of developmental changes, symptom\nvariations, and compensatory neural mechanisms. \n\nRegarding other relevant phenotypes, a recent meta-analysis in youths\nwith depression or anxiety disorders (k = 48)  reported increased activation in the\nbilateral amygdala (especially for anxiety disorders) across a range of emotion\nregulation and decision-making tasks, which extended to the anterior cingulate\nand putamen\u2014regions in the salience network that were also reported in\nsome of the individual irritability studies reviewed here. However, no\nsignificant clusters were found when restricting to youths with major depressive\ndisorder (MDD), suggesting that the lack of neural convergence may not be an\nissue specific to the irritability phenotype. \n\nDiverse fMRI tasks across multiple neurocognitive domains have been used\nin past studies in irritability. Although a conceptual framework categorizing\nstudies into emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and reward processing was\nuseful to facilitate systematic analyses of neural convergence, within-domain\nheterogeneity was still present. This is evident in the emotional reactivity\nstudies reviewed. Although most of these studies were fundamentally facial\nemotion recognition tasks, these paradigms involved varied task demands probing\npassive and active attentional processes, priming, and control conditions\nranging from nose width ratings to gender and shape recognition that potentially\ninvolve different psychological processes. Stimulus variations such as the use\nof morphed vs non-morphed faces, types of emotions, valence and arousal, and\npresentation duration might address specific research questions concerning\nemotion processing in irritability; but that likely further contributes to\nnonconvergence across individual studies, given the corresponding impact on the\nunderlying psychological operations and hence associated neural responses.\nSimilarly, a variety of reward tasks were used. Of note, these reward tasks\nvaried in the reward contexts, as some involved the elicitation of frustration\nvia rigged reward,  whereas others occurred in more\nconventional reward settings.  A recent study found task-dependent functional connectivity\nto be predictive of irritability symptom severity only when frustration was\nevoked during scan, \nhighlighting the importance of emotional contexts. There is also inconsistency\nin operationalizing the temporal dimensions of reward processing in these reward\ntasks. We strove to reconstruct the full temporal course by carefully pooling\nstudy contrasts that reflect the core phases of reward processing (eg, reward\nanticipation, reward receipt, and feedback), and yet no significant convergent\nclusters were found. Studies probing cognitive control are mixed, partly because\nthere is no generally agreed-upon definition of cognitive control dysfunctions\nin irritability. These subordinate functions range from inhibitory\ncontrol,  reversal learning,  to attention control processes ; the latter are shared with emotional\nreactivity and reward processing studies that have attention-related\ndemands.  Although we do not rule out the\npossibility that the neural correlates of irritability are indeed very\nheterogeneous because of its transdiagnostic nature and the myriad\nneurocognitive functions that are potentially affected, the heterogeneity in\nfMRI task designs reflect a lack of consensus in the key neurocognitive\nconstructs of interest and the empirical approaches in probing those\nneurocognitive processes in irritability research. Study variances related to\ntask heterogeneity are coupled with heterogeneous statistical thresholds in the\nfMRI analyses. Therefore, the absence of neural convergence is perhaps less\nsurprising. \n\nStructural MRI obviates validity and reliability issues in task\nfMRI.  Our review on\nstructural MRI suggests potential irritability-related volumetric reductions in\nwidely distributed frontal regions, possibly implicating decreased top-down\nregulation in irritable mood and outbursts.  A few studies report volumetric\nreduction in the salience network, possibly implicating neural alterations\nassociated with early stimulus detection and response.  However, this structural review is based on a small number\nof studies using different irritability measures. This highlights the need for\nmore research, especially those studies examining other morphometrics such as\ncortical thickness and surface area. Thus, it remains unclear whether\nlimitations with task fMRI and\/or constructs\/measures of irritability\ncontributed to the lack of convergence in fMRI findings. \n\nCommon to many fields of research, bias for publishing novel and\nsignificant findings contributes to the use of individualized task designs,\nflexible preprocessing pipelines, analytical procedures, and thresholding that\nare unique to individual studies. These research practices often give rise to\nstudy findings that are replicable only in well-powered fMRI analyses with\nsufficiently large samples and representative ranges of irritability symptoms,\nboth of which are difficult to achieve in individual laboratories. However, this\ndoes not necessarily suggest that task fMRI studies on irritability should be\nreplaced with an alternative neuroimaging modality, as task fMRI is critical to\nunderstanding the functional significance of altered neural functions and their\nassociations with irritability.  In addition to neural activation, task\nfMRI enables investigation on functional connectivity. Indeed, emerging evidence\nshows that individual differences in irritability may be reflected in the\ndisrupted integration between and within brain regions and networks.  As a limitation, the current meta-analysis inferred\nfunctional neural convergence based on peak coordinates; future work with a\ndirect synthesis of full voxelwise statistical maps may bypass some of the\nissues related to the researcher\u2019s degrees of freedom in the\npreprocessing, analyzing, and thresholding of fMRI data and may uncover neural\ndysfunctions associated with irritability. \n\nSeveral recommendations are noted here for moving irritability fMRI\nresearch forward. First, an agreed-upon battery of irritability phenotype\nmeasurements will facilitate comparisons and data pooling across studies and\nincrease sample sizes, potentially improving the convergence of findings.\nLikewise, we encourage more detailed assessments of symptom dimensions in\nirritability, parsing possibly different neurobiological substrates of tonic and\nphasic irritability. Relatedly, more thorough clinical assessments of\ncomorbidities would provide the necessary information to clarify\nirritability-related neural responses that are independent of co-occurring\nsymptoms and heterogeneous features within specific diagnostic groups (eg, ADHD\nand ASD). Second, sample characteristics, including information about\npsychiatric medication, pubertal development, and other environmental risk\nfactors (eg, socioeconomic disadvantages and chronic stress) are useful to\nidentify exogenous sources of individual variances, enhancing the robustness of\nfMRI findings. Transparent reporting of potentially overlapping participants and\na wider range of recruitment sites, especially in underrepresented populations\nand\/or those at risk for severe irritability, are needed to diversify the study\nsamples. Third, mining population-based neuroimaging datasets, such as the\nAdolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD),  provides the opportunity to improve\nclinical heterogeneity and to overcome small sample sizes in individual studies.\nAs measures specifically designed for assessing irritability symptoms are not\ncommon in these large-scale studies (eg, ARI),  we advocate for including such\nirritability measures that are well-validated and reliable in future study\nprotocols. Fourth, fMRI task heterogeneity implies that a better incentive\nstructure is needed to motivate the use of fMRI tasks that validly and reliably\nprobe neurocognitive functions informing the pathophysiology of irritability.\nThis does not mean imposing a stringent framework on fMRI paradigms, as testing\nnovel task designs in individual laboratories are valuable training\nopportunities for early-career researchers and benefit new hypothesis\ngeneration.  Instead,\npre-registration of fMRI task designs and analysis plans can promote task\nhomogeneity and standardized processing pipelines across individual studies,\nwhile ensuring reasonable between-study variations that address specific\nresearch questions. Fifth, open task and data sharing are currently underway in\nour laboratories to promote collaborative irritability research. Pediatric\nneuroimaging in youths with irritability can be challenging, especially when\nfrustration tasks and deception are involved. Making mock scan protocols,\nexperimental setups, task instructions, and debriefing procedures openly\navailable may help to overcome this challenge. Sixth, the past fMRI studies on\nirritability were largely conducted at a regional level. Multivariate approaches\nexamining neural coactivation and connectivity patterns across the whole brain\nmay provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural circuitries and\ninteractions mediating irritability.  Other neuroimaging modalities such as connectivity\nstudies using fractional anisotropy  and functional near-infrared spectroscopy measuring\nreal-time cortical neural responses during interactive tasks  offer novel angles to study neural\ndysfunctions in irritability. Studies analyzing both task fMRI and task-free\nresting state data also allow for clarifying task-related neural\nnoises.  Finally,\nfrustration realistically occurs in social and interactive contexts among\nyouths. To enhance ecological validity, future irritability research might\ninvestigate neural dysfunctions during frustrative social nonreward, such as\nsocial rejection. \n\nThis study is the first systematic review and quantitative synthesis of\nthe task fMRI studies on irritability. We observed vast clinical heterogeneity\nand methodological variations across studies, potentially contributing to the\nabsence of neural convergence in irritability as shown in the quantitative\nsyntheses across neurocognitive domains and sensitivity syntheses restricting\nstimulus type, irritability measures, and developmental ages.

Understanding people\u2019s neural responses to high-calorie food cues might help to develop better interventions for preventing or reducing overeating and weight gain. In this review, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of viewing high-calorie food cues in both normal-weight people and people with obesity. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles, retrieving 59 eligible studies containing 2410 unique participants. The results of an activation likelihood estimation indicate large clusters in a range of structures, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, insula\/frontal operculum, culmen, as well as the middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Conjunction analysis suggested that both normal-weight people and people with obesity activated OFC, supporting that the two groups share common neural substrates of reward processing when viewing high-calorie food cues. The contrast analyses did not show significant activations when comparing obesity with normal-weight. Together, these results provide new important evidence for the neural mechanism underlying high-calorie food cues processing, and new insights into common and distinct brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues between people with obesity and normal-weight people. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nThe prevalence of obesity is problematic and rising in both developed and developing nations [ ]. This fact has far-reaching and costly implications, because obesity contributes to the development of numerous diseases (e.g., diabetes, some cancers) [ , , ], and it is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) [ ]. Not surprisingly, excessive weight has become an increasing threat to healthcare systems [ ], and accounts for an estimated 2.8 million deaths per annum worldwide [ ]. These statistics have prompted a plethora of research aimed at understanding factors that contribute to the development or maintenance of obesity [ , , , , ]. \n\nOne contributing factor is the overconsumption of high-calorie or unhealthy foods (e.g., chocolate cake), and underconsumption of low-calorie or healthy foods (e.g., salad), which leads to a positive energy balance and, subsequently, weight gain [ , , ]. We are currently facing the rise of the \u2018obesogenic\u2019 environment [ ] where the exposure to food advertisements, and availability of cheap, unhealthy, and energy dense foods has dramatically increased [ , ]. The constant exposure to high-calorie foods and food cues may promote overconsumption by stimulating brain reward and motivation pathways [ , ]. In this vein, using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (  f  MRI), a growing number of research has been conducted to investigate neural responses to various forms of food stimuli [ ], such as liquid tastants, food odors [ ], or visual food cues [ , ]. Moreover, recent reviews have used   f  MRI-based meta-analysis such as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ , ] to evaluate the consistency of findings across these studies [ , , , , , , , ]. For instance, Chen and Zeffiro meta-analyzed 39 experiments with 995 participants and found that taste (e.g, insula), sensory integration (e.g., postcentral gyrus), and reward processing (e.g., amygdala) regions were involved in processing sweet food cues (one kind of high-calorie foods) [ ]. With regard to visual food cues, several   f  MRI-based meta-analyses have also been conducted [ , , , ]. For example, an ALE meta-analysis including 12 experiments and 201 participants reported that visual food cues were reliably associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the visual system proper (e.g., the occipital lobe) rather than reward-related brain network (e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex) [ ]. \n\nNone of the aforementioned meta-analyses, however, have investigated which brain regions are concurrently activated in response to viewing high-calorie food cues specifically. Furthermore, most of these meta-analyses only included participants with normal-weight and did not consider individuals with obesity (i.e., body mass index \u226530. A meta-analysis pooling data across relevant   f  MRI studies would therefore be warranted, as it may help to understand neural responses of viewing high-calorie food cues among people with various weight-status categories (e.g., normal-weight, obesity) and develop better interventions for preventing or reducing overeating and obesity. \n\nIn the present study, we conducted   f  MRI meta-analyses of viewing high-calorie food cues to address four novel aspects. First and foremost, we investigated brain activations related to high-calorie visual food cues. Second, we meta-analyzed not only studies involving normal-weight people, but also studies involving participants with obesity. Third, we performed conjunction and contrast analyses to assess common and distinct brain activations between normal-weight people and people with obesity (e.g., normal-weight \u2229 obesity; normal-weight versus obesity). Last but not least, we utilized a new version of GingerALE brain map software (3.0.2) which was revised because of the implementation errors in multiple comparisons corrections in its old version [ ]. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Study Selection and Inclusion Criteria \n  \nThe current meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines ( ). A protocol for this work was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF:  ). To obtain functional imaging studies of viewing high-calorie food cues for use in the current meta-analysis, a topic search in the databases PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses was conducted for all papers published before 9th August 2021. The following string was used to search for the titles, abstracts and keywords of papers: ((neuroimaging OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cpositron-emission tomography\u201d OR PET OR fMRI) AND (food) AND (images OR pictures)). In this search, PubMed returned 301 results, Web of Science returned 1388 results, PsycINFO returned 262 results, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses returned 46 results. Abstracts of articles were reviewed, and the full text of an article was read whenever a paper\u2019s title or abstract indicated that the study might be relevant to analyses. In addition, to help ensure that all studies on the topic of interest were included, references from relevant articles were reviewed, and studies that were potentially relevant were examined from those references.   outlines the detailed study selection procedure. \n\nStudies were incorporated into this research if they (1) were in English, (2) used   f  MRI, (3) used whole-brain analysis, (4) involved populations with normal-weight, overweight, or obesity. In samples of adult participants, a group with obesity was defined as an average body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg\/m  or above, a group with overweight as an average BMI between 25 and 29.99 kg\/m , and a group with normal-weight as an average BMI between 18.5 and 24.99 kg\/m . In samples of children\/adolescents, obesity was defined as a BMI percentile of 95th or above, overweight as a BMI between the 85th and 94.99th percentile, and normal-weight as a BMI between the 5th and 84.99th percentile; if BMI percentile was not reported, international cutoff points of BMI were used for defining obesity and overweight [ ], (5) used a viewing task (e.g., passive viewing task) in which cues of high-calorie foods were presented; Studies employing inhibitory control task, food choice task, or delay discounting task were excluded, (6) reported analyses for the contrast high-calorie foods > non-foods or low-calorie foods, (7) brain coordinates were available in Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach space. If information crucial to our meta-analysis was not available in an article, we requested it from the corresponding authors. In addition, we excluded studies that explicitly indicated that all their participants are from special population (e.g., cancer survivors) or had a known eating disorder (e.g., binge eating disorder). Finally, when two studies used overlapping samples, we only included the study with a larger sample size. \n\n\n### 2.2. Activation Likelihood Estimation Analysis \n  \nMeta-analyses were conducted in GingerALE brain map software (3.0.2) ( ), according to standard procedures outlined in the GingerALE user manual. Coordinates were extracted from whole-brain results, and those reported in Talairach space were transformed into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space using the automated transformation tool implemented in GingerALE. GingerALE algorithm minimizes within-experiment effects\u2014clusters are more likely to represent agreement between experiments than being driven by individual research [ ]. Because of this, we included all of the reported activation coordinates if a study included both the contrast high-calorie foods > non-food and high-calorie foods > low-calorie foods, as it was unlikely that a single study would bias the analyses (see   for the results of analyzing high-calorie vs. neutral and high-calorie vs. low-calorie contrasts separately). Similarly, foci obtained from contrasts in fasting and fed conditions were also merged. \n\nAs a first step, we performed an overall meta-analysis on activation foci derived from all the included articles investigating brain activation in response to viewing high-calorie visual food cues. We then performed two separate ALE analyses on two categories of studies in relation to the weight status of the participants (normal-weight or obesity) (Because only 12 independent samples included participants with overweight (for more, see  ), we do not present a separate meta-analysis on these overweight-related studies given the lack of statistical power). Following the guidelines of previous work [ , , ], the cluster determining threshold was set at a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.01 and a voxel-level cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### 2.3. Modulation Effect of Sex \n  \nWe extracted per-voxel probabilities of activation in the meta-analysis for each of the identified brain regions to examine potential modulating effect of sex on the results of our analysis. \n\n\n### 2.4. Conjunction and Contrast Analyses \n  \nTo compare the results of pairwise meta-analysis (e.g., normal weight vs. obesity; normal weight vs. overweight\/obesity), we performed conjunction and contrast analyses in GingerALE. Following the recommendations by Eickhoff et al. (2016) [ ], the cluster determining threshold was set at   p   < 0.01 with 10,000 permutations and a minimum cluster size of 200 mm . \n\n\n### 2.5. Results Visualization \n  \nFor visualization purposes, all results were projected onto an MNI-space template brain (e.g., MNI152.nii) using MRIcroGL ( ). \n\n\n### 2.6. Study Quality Assessment \n  \nA 7-item quality scale modified from Nichol et al. (2018) [ ] was used to assess the quality of the included studies (see   for study quality of each included study). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nOur search identified 59 eligible studies (total   m   = 59) [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ], 68 independent samples (total   k   = 68), and a total of 2410 participants (total   N   = 2410). A complete list of studies and their characteristics can be seen in  . Of these 59 studies, 39 independent samples (  k   = 39,   N   = 979) included participants with normal-weight, 17 independent samples (  k   = 17,   N   = 697) included participants with obesity, and 12 independent samples (  k   = 12,   N   = 734) included participants with overweight. \n\n\n### 3.2. Overall Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe primary meta-analysis that pooled data across all 68 independent samples (854 foci) revealed that high-calorie food cues activated thirteen statistically significant clusters (total volume of activation of 33,632 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0694). The results are reported in   and graphically represented in  . We observed that viewing high-calorie food cues consistently activated the bilateral lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, insula, as well as the right middle occipital gyrus, left culmen, and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). For all of the identified clusters, the modulation analysis revealed no effect of sex (all   p   values > 0.05). \n\n\n### 3.3. Brain Response to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in People with Normal-Weight \n  \nFor brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues in participants with normal-weight, the meta-analysis of 39 independent samples (493 foci) identified seven significant clusters (total volume of activation of 10,680 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0713) that covered regions of the bilateral fusiform gyrus, OFC, insula, as well as the right lingual gyrus ( ,  ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Brain Response to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in People with Obesity \n  \nFor brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues in participants with obesity, the meta-analysis of 17 independent samples (216 foci) identified seven significant clusters (total volume of activation of 4952 mm  and maximum ALE value of 0.0533) that covered regions of the bilateral OFC, left lingual gyrus, and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ,  ). \n\n\n### 3.5. Conjunction and Contrast Analyses \n  \nTo identify clusters of activation which were common to normal-weight people and people with obesity, we carried out a conjunction analysis on the activations obtained in the previous two separate meta-analyses. The results revealed significant activations in the bilateral OFC, which was commonly activated in both normal-weight people and individuals with obesity ( ,  ). \n\nTo identify clusters of activation which were unique to normal-weight people and people with obesity, a contrast analysis was carried out between the activations obtained in the previous two separate meta-analyses. The analysis revealed no significant activations. \n\nFinally, we conducted additional analyses with overweight and obese as one group and compared this combined group with the normal weight group ( ). Conjunction analysis revealed significant activations in the bilateral OFC, fusiform gyrus, and the left insula, which were commonly activated in both normal-weight people and individuals with obesity\/overweight. The obesity\/overweight minus normal-weight subtraction analysis displayed 2 significant clusters located in the bilateral culmen. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nBy meta-analyzing 59   f  MRI studies and 68 independent samples, we showed a network of brain regions related to viewing high-calorie food cues. Further, we presented two separate meta-analyses to examine neural responses of viewing high-calorie food cues in normal-weight people or people with obesity, and investigated the common and differential neural responses between these two groups. Although some meta-analyses have been conducted on this topic before [ , , , ], to the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to examine the neural mechanisms of viewing high-calorie food cues across groups with a different weight-status. \n\nWe found that, overall, viewing high-calorie food cues was associated with increased activity in a network of brain regions located in the bilateral lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, OFC, amygdala, insula, as well as the right middle occipital gyrus, left culmen, and the right IFG. The conjunction analysis suggested that viewing high-calorie food cues activated the OFC in both normal-weight people and people with obesity. Different from the conclusions from previous reviews on the topic of food cue reactivity in obesity [ , ], but similar to the viewpoint of a behavioral meta-analysis of food cue reactivity [ ], the contrast analysis revealed no significant activations when comparing groups with obesity to groups with normal-weight (more on this in  ). \n\n### 4.1. Core Brain Regions Activated by High-Calorie Visual Food Cues \n  \nOur overall results are similar to a previous meta-analysis focusing on the functional neuroanatomy of high-calorie food liquid processing (e.g., sweet liquid) [ ].  \n\nThe amygdala and OFC are connected with each other and frequently activated in food studies. The amygdala is thought to form the core of a neural system for fear processing [ ]. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the amygdala also plays a prominent role in mediating positive\/reward stimuli processing [ ]. These findings have led to the viewpoint that the amygdala\u2019s predominant role may be the detection of and response to motivationally important stimuli [ ]. In addition, it was proposed that the amygdala was responsible for forming an \u201caffective tag\u201d to the salient stimuli [ ]. Therefore, the amygdala activations that we found in current meta-analysis are likely to reflect the salience and emotional impacts of high-calorie food cues. The OFC receives information from brain regions involved in sensory processing (e.g., insula, fusiform gyrus), affective processing (e.g., amygdala), and memory (e.g., hippocampus), and plays a prominent role in integrating, encoding, and retrieving reward value about stimulus [ ]. There is a strong and consistent activation of the OFC in reward-related tasks such as decision-making tasks [ ] or cue-reactivity tasks [ ]. Further, several studies have shown that the magnitude of activity in this region correlated with pleasantness or tastiness ratings of food\/food cues [ , , ]. Therefore, the OFC activations in current study could reflect the process of monitoring and encoding higher reward value of high-calorie food cues. It should be noted that we did not find that \u201cclassical\u201d reward areas such as the nucleus accumbens, putamen, or caudate were involved in processing of high-calorie visual food cues. This is different from a previous meta-analysis which showed that the putamen and caudate exhibited responses to high-calorie liquids [ ]. Although comparing across meta-analyses is difficult given differences in included studies, we could speculate that reward areas are more likely to be activated when people are eating\/tasting high-calorie foods rather than viewing high-calorie food cues. \n\nThe insula\/frontal operculum has been identified as the primary taste cortex [ , ]. The activation of this taste cortex in response to high-calorie visual food cues may represent memory retrieval of previous gustatory experiences with these palatable foods [ ]. In addition, the insula has also been highlighted as a region that plays an important role in craving for drugs (e.g., cocaine) [ ] and foods [ ]. Therefore, it is also possible that insula activation is the result of high urges to eat in participants exposed to calorie-rich and appetizing food pictures [ ]. \n\nWe also found some evidence that the culmen was activated by high-calorie food cues. Although traditionally considered a major motor structure of the brain, there is evidence that the culmen\/cerebellum plays a broader role in homeostatic regulation [ ], and shows connections with limbic and reward systems [ ]. Given that both the meta-analysis of neural responses to sweet stimuli by Chen and Zeffiro [ ] and the current meta-analysis found that the cerebellum increases activity in response to food simulation, future studies and theories of eating behavior may benefit from inclusion of cerebellar influences in their hypotheses forming process. \n\nThe remiaining significant clusters found in response to high-calorie visual food cues were located in the occipitotemporal gyrus (the bilateral lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus). These visual areas consistently respond to multiple drug-related (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco) [ ] and gaming cues [ ]. Drawing parallels it is conceivable that higher reward salience of higher reward salience of high-calorie food images modulate neural activity in these visual areas, just as drug-related cues do, and leads to different visual processing when compared to control images. \n\n\n### 4.2. Common and Specific Brain Activations between Normal-Weight and Obesity \n  \nFrom an evolutionary perspective, energy-dense foods confer a greater survival advantage for primate species, including humans. From this viewpoint, researchers argued that our species has a natural preference for high-calorie foods [ ], which then could be perceived as more rewarding. In light of this, the results of our conjunction analysis\u2013increased activity in the OFC, a reward-related brain area \u2013 are not surprising. \n\nThe null findings in the contrast analysis between groups of individuals with normal-weight and obesity are different from the conclusions from previous reviews on the topic of cue reactivity in obesity. Past work showed that obesity was related to an enhanced reward\/salience response towards (high-calorie) food stimuli [ , ]. It should be noted that these reviews included studies using other stimuli than high-calorie food pictures (e.g., gustatory stimuli, such as chocolate milkshakes), which might lead to different conclusions than our work. Indeed, when only included studies using food pictures, two newly published meta-analyses found similar results to current work [ , ]. For example, Morys and colleagues [ ] meta-analyzed 13 studies that investigated group differences (obese vs. normal-weight) in responses to food vs. non-food pictures viewing, and found little evidence for obesity-related differences in brain responses to food cues. In addition, our results are in line with the behavioral literature, as a meta-analysis including 45 published reports did not find evidence for the influence of BMI on food cue reactivity [ ]. Taken together, current evidence tends to support that there are no (high-calorie) visual food cue reactivity differences between normal-weight people and people with obesity. Intuitively, this conclusion might contradict some findings of longitudinal studies on the topic of cue reactivity, which found that behavioral and neural responses to food cues predict weight gain [ , ]. However, researchers argued that food cue reactivity is not the only factor that influences food intake and weight gain [ , , , ]. For instance, theories proposed that reactions to hyper-palatable food cues might lead to increased food intake and weight gain only in individuals with lower dietary self-regulation, though future research should examine whether this is the case. \n\n\n### 4.3. Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nDespite its strengths, our meta-analysis has some limitations. First and foremost, like most   f  MRI meta-analyses, we incorporated only the reported significant brain activation peaks from the included studies, which resulted in some information loss (e.g., not significant small clusters of activations) of the original fMRI data. We recommend that future studies share their original data or unthresholded statistical maps on a data repository such as Neurovault (e.g.,  ), and an image-based meta-analysis of the neural correlates of viewing high-calorie food cues will be possible when sufficient raw data or statistical maps are available. Second, not all corresponding authors answered our requests for data. In addition, some studies which would be eligible for our meta-analysis did not report the main effects of high-calorie visual food cues on BOLD changes. As such, we recommend that future studies report these results in their   even if these contrasts might not be the key focus of the study. Next, obesity was operationalized via BMI in this meta-analysis, which is a relatively coarse measure of body density and may overlook relevant physical characteristics, such as body fat and anthropometric features. Last but not least, we did not examine the neural effect of high-calorie visual food cues in people who are overweight because of the relatively small number of studies. Moreover, compared to the number of normal-weight studies, the number of studies involved people with obesity was relatively small. Thus, more research is needed to investigate the neural effects of viewing high-calorie food cues in people with overweight\/obesity. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the results of our meta-analysis suggest a core neural network of viewing high-calorie food cues, which comprise reward-related as well as visual brain areas and brain regions related to taste processing. The conjunction analysis suggests that groups of individuals with normal-weight and obesity share common neural substrates of reward processing when viewing high-calorie food cues. Finally, there seem to be no differences in neural processing of high-calorie food images between people with normal-weight and obesity. Together, our work provides the first meta-analytic evidence for the neural mechanism underlying high-calorie food cues processing and new insights into common and distinct brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8699077,"text_md5":"9ee1aea99da9523b3eaf0dece7958e71","field_positions":{"authors":[0,43],"journal":[44,53],"publication_year":[55,59],"title":[70,214],"keywords":[228,300],"abstract":[313,1746],"body":[1755,25678]},"batch":1,"pmid":34942889,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci11121587","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8699077","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8699077"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8699077\">8699077<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8699077  Brain Responses to High-Calorie Visual Food Cues in Individuals with Normal-Weight or Obesity: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis"}

Previous meta-analyses performed on these functional magnetic resonance imaging findings typically report significant between-group contrasts comparing typical readers and readers with reading difficulty or a clinical diagnosis of developmental dyslexia. In order to advance our understanding of cross-linguistic convergence of reading-related brain activations for these reader groups, analyses using activation likelihood estimation were carried out separately for typical and atypical readers who ranged from children to adults. Contrasts were analyzed for tasks involving rhyming or reading of letter or word stimuli presented visually in English, Dutch, Italian, German, French, or Norwegian. Typical readers showed reliable activation in only left lateralized regions, including the inferior frontal area, precentral area and middle temporal gyrus. Atypical readers also showed activation in the left inferior frontal area and precentral region, in addition to significant activations in the right hemisphere, including the superior, medial and inferior frontal regions, lingual gyrus and the inferior occipital area. These results distinguish between typical and atypical reader group activations, showing common and distinct regions of activation when engaged in reading-related activities, extending previous meta-analyses on identifying brain regions relevant to reading to include cross-linguistic analyses for alphabetic scripts. Results support the universality of a signature pattern of brain activation in developmental dyslexia across alphabetic languages. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nReading involves translating written symbols to sounds in order to extract meaning. This process is complex, and to be fluent, readers coordinate multiple skills such as word decoding and reading rate effectively and simultaneously so that they can attend to comprehension demands from the text ( ,  ;  ). Given the complex sensory and cognitive mechanisms involved in reading, it is not surprising that substantial behavioral variability is observed across reading development. In particular, a significant portion of school-age children experience difficulty in reading acquisition. In the United States, as many as 15\u201320% of the school-age population show evidence of difficulty in reading ( ). Significant research effort has been dedicated to understanding individual differences in reading development, including multiple perspectives of research spanning social (e.g.,  ), cognitive (e.g.,  ), genetic (e.g.,  ), and brain activation patterns (e.g.,  ). For functional neuroimaging research in particular, accumulating research has established a set of brain regions that has been shown to support reading-related activities in typical readers in contrast to struggling readers (for a review, see  ;  ). \n\nThe present study aims to extend these findings by examining cross-linguistic convergence of brain activation patterns for typical readers and struggling readers separately, rather than comparatively. To date, empirical evidence largely contributes to our understanding of brain regions that are engaged in typical readers versus struggling readers, which offers a comparative perspective on brain activations for reading. The focus of these analyses is to identify the common and distinct brain regions that contribute to reading in typical readers and in struggling readers. To expand our understanding of reading brain systems, the current study examines brain systems engaged for typical readers and struggling readers as distinct groups. With the aim to examine cross-linguistic convergence, studies conducted in different alphabetic languages and countries are included in this meta-analysis. These studies have variable inclusionary criteria for struggling readers. In the present paper, the term   struggling readers   refers to children and adults fitting one or more of the following criteria: (1) reported familial risk of reading difficulty; (2) received a clinical diagnosis of dyslexia; (3) showed significantly lower performance in reading-related tasks (e.g., 1 or 2 SD below average on standardized measures) and the low performance cannot be attributed to impoverished learning opportunity, dysfunctional visual or auditory processing and inferior intelligence. \n\nConverging evidence across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate a distinct brain activation pattern for reading. Early in reading development, children show activations in bilateral regions in temporo-parietal, temporo-occipital, and inferior frontal regions ( ). During early elementary school years, typically developing readers shift from bilateral to left lateralized recruitment of these regions ( ). This pattern is relatively stable into adulthood, with the anterior system supporting motor production and the processing of low-frequency exception words and non-words; the posterior dorsal system supporting grapheme\u2013phoneme correspondence and efficient word reading; and the posterior ventral system supporting automatic recognition of printed words ( ;  ;  ). Struggling readers, most often characterized with developmental dyslexia, show a distinct brain activation pattern that relies on right hemisphere homologous regions in the posterior temporo-parietal and temporo-occipital regions ( ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Struggling reader groups have also shown hyperactivation of frontal regions ( ), although evidence suggests this increased activation is not a signature of dyslexia but rather a reflection of the increased difficulty of the task given similar activations in dyslexic children and reading-matched peers compared to age-matched peers ( ). The signature brain activation pattern has been shown to be independent of cognitive abilities (i.e., IQ;  ) and consistent for native readers of different alphabetic script-based languages ( ). Furthermore, struggling readers who show reading improvement following reading intervention show activation patterns that more closely approximate that of their typically developing peers (e.g., children:  ; adults:  ). \n\nIn an effort to summarize neuroimaging findings comparing sets of brain regions supporting the processing of reading-related tasks, meta-analysis has been carried out on between-group contrasts comparing typical and struggling readers ( ;  ,  ). These meta-analyses provide an overview of brain activation patterns across samples in different studies that share similar experimental procedures, including participant inclusionary\/exclusionary criteria and tasks. Using between-group contrasts,   characterized regions of hypo- and hyperactivation that were consistent across studies involving struggling readers with dyslexia across different alphabetic languages.   reported that typical adult readers exhibited higher activation than struggling adult readers in a large set of brain regions, including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, left precuneus and left middle occipital area. In contrast, struggling readers showed higher activity in the right insula and right thalamus. In the case of adult readers, the difference in activation patterns converged in the hypoactivation in the left hemisphere. This finding was consistent with subsequent research in children reporting a lack of engagement in the left temporal and occipital regions (e.g.,  ,  ;  ) and possible neural response to behavioral intervention that resulted in improved reading skills ( ) or a compensatory mechanism to overcome challenges in reading ( ). \n\n sought to provide more specific locations for activation abnormalities that had previously been characterized broadly as temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal. Consistent with the   findings,   reported that struggling readers, combining both children and adults, demonstrated hypoactivation in inferior frontal, parietal, and temporal regions in the left hemisphere and hyperactivation in left subcortical regions and right medial frontal area. Subsequently,   conducted two meta-analyses separately for children (ages ranged from 9 to 11) and adults (ages ranged from 18 to 30). In these analyses, contrasts between typical and atypical readers were analyzed with Signed Differential Mapping (SDM) software, which combines features of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) and another meta-analytic method, multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA; for a discussion, see  ). Across these studies, struggling children readers showed hypoactivation in the bilateral inferior parietal lobules and no hyperactivation in any brain region. In contrast, struggling adult readers showed significant hypoactivation in the left fusiform gyrus and hyperactivation in bilateral subcortical areas. These cross-sectional findings comparing typical and struggling readers further suggest a lack of engagement in left temporal and occipital regions in supporting fluent and accurate reading-related activities in adults and these regions were not readily recruited to support reading in children. \n\nThe above meta-analyses focus on between-group contrasts and thus are helpful in understanding   divergent   brain activation patterns between-groups. However, these prior meta-analyses do not speak to the   convergence   of brain activation between-groups. To address this gap in the literature, the present meta-analysis examines brain regions recruited to engage in reading-related tasks separately for typical and struggling readers. Unlike previous meta-analyses, we used meta-analysis with the goal of identifying both common and distinct brain regions in children and adults with varying reading ability across different alphabetic script-based languages. This approach can help identify clusters that can be used in future connectivity analyses to illuminate the interaction between brain regions as an interconnected network that supports reading. Specifically, selecting brain regions that are common to both typical and atypical readers could inform understanding of the common and differential functional networks that are employed in readers with diverse reading capacity. To this end, we included published studies that reported activation coordinates separately for typical and struggling readers. Two meta-analyses were conducted separately for these two groups of readers. Given that children are in the process of developing fluent reading and that engaging in reading-related tasks is effortful, it is expected that typical and struggling readers would recruit left frontal regions when engaging in reading-related tasks. However, we expected typical and struggling readers to demonstrate different activation patterns in posterior brain regions because of struggling readers\u2019 atypical mapping of sound-symbol correspondence. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### STUDY SELECTION AND PARTICIPANTS \n  \nAn initial PubMed database search with search criteria: \u201cdyslexia\u201d or \u201creading difficulty\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cPET\u201d yielded 508 potential papers. These papers were then reviewed against a set of inclusion criteria. Papers included in the analysis were published in English, used fMRI or PET methods, used whole brain analyses, reported foci separately for typical and atypical readers who had matched demographics, included visual tasks that involved letter or word stimuli, and involved alphabetic languages. Case studies or studies involving clinical populations (e.g., patients with schizophrenia) were excluded. Studies reporting region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were also excluded. A final set of 13 papers contributed 131 foci for typical readers and 101 foci for atypical readers (see   Table   ). \n  \nList of foci, number of experiments and subjects, by reader type. \n  \nUsing this set of inclusion\u2013exclusion criteria, we were able to obtain two samples of typical and struggling readers with comparable sample sizes and matched demographic characteristics. In total, there were 172 typical readers and 174 struggling readers across the 13 studies (see   Table   ). In one study,   examined both age-matched and reading-matched typical readers as control participants relative to atypical readers. Age-matched typical readers were included rather than reading-matched typical readers to maintain consistency across the set of studies. Across these studies, struggling readers were characterized as having reading difficulties or dyslexia based on either previous diagnoses (including familial risk assessment) or behavioral evaluations for inclusion in that group for the specific study. \n\n Table    provides an overview of each study, including participant demographics, task descriptions and criteria for participants to be classified as struggling readers. Studies spanned six different alphabetic languages: English, Dutch, Italian, German, French, and Norwegian, which are comparable to studies included in previous meta-analyses. Studies included child, adolescent, and adult participants (i.e., about 8\u201363 years). Ten studies examined child and\/or adolescent participants, two studies examined adult participants, and one study examined participants from adolescence into adulthood. \n  \nCharacteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis. \n    \n\n### TASK DESCRIPTION \n  \nEight of the 13 studies (see   Table   , studies 1, 2, 6, 8\u201310, 12, 13) separately reported more than one contrast for both typical and struggling readers, such as an activation condition (e.g., rhyming words or letter names) versus baseline (e.g., fixation, blank) and an activation condition versus a control condition (e.g., matching letters, matching symbol strings). Almost all studies required a button press (see   Table   , studies 2\u20138, 10\u201313); one study required movement of a joystick (1) and one did not require a motor response (9). In accordance with prior meta-analyses involving participants with dyslexia (e.g.,  ,  ), only one contrast per reading group was included from each study. As in  , preference was given to contrasts that involved phonological tasks such as rhyme judgment, reading words, or reading pseudowords. When more than one contrast involved phonological tasks, the task with the higher number of reported foci was used. Seven studies included an experimental task involving rhyming of letters, words, pseudowords, or pictures. During rhyming tasks, participants determine whether two visually presented alphabetic stimuli (e.g., letters, words) rhyme. As control tasks, participants either experienced a rest condition (e.g., fixation) or completed a matching task (e.g., determine if two letters match). In two studies ( ;  ), participants were asked to read silently either words or pseudowords (i.e., pronounceable letter strings with no meaning). Baseline tasks involved viewing false font strings (e.g., strings of non-alphabetic characters). Study 10 ( ) used a phonological lexical decision task, in which participants determined whether a visually presented stimulus sounded like a word. Study 11 used passive viewing of word pairs, in which participants attended to pairs of four-letter common French words ( ). Participants responded to stars interspersed throughout blocks to maintain visual attention on the word pairs. Study 12 used a categorical matching task with letters and geometric figures, in which participants responded when two visually presented images were unmatched (e.g., one letter and one geometric figure;  ). Finally, in study 13 participants completed a letter match task in which they first read silently a string of six lowercase letters and then determined if a visually presented pair of letters, one upper case and one lower case, matched ( ). \n\n\n### DATA ANALYSIS \n  \nTwo meta-analyses were conducted using ALE: one for typical readers and one for struggling readers with matching demographics. Both meta-analyses were conducted using GingerALE version 2.1.3 ( ,  ;  ). Coordinates for each study were reported in either MNI or Talairach space. Prior to analysis, MNI coordinates were converted to Talairach space using the   icbm2tal   transform provided in the GingerALE software ( ). \n\nGingerALE was first developed by   and updated with a revised algorithm by  . ALE treats foci as three-dimensional Gaussian distributions that are centered on the reported coordinates ( ;  ) and computes the union of activation probabilities for each voxel to get ALE maps. At each voxel, the ALE maps are compared to an ALE null distribution, which has been determined by a permutation test, to obtain associated   p  -values. A resulting threshold for the ALE map is computed based on the chosen false discovery rate (FDR;  ). A minimum cluster size of 100 mm  was used to create a thresholded ALE map for each meta-analysis and for subsequent cluster analysis with FDR = 0.01. All results were obtained using the non-additive method, which limits within-experiment effects ( ). Results were reported in Talairach space ( ), displayed using the anatomical templates provided by the GingerALE program, and labeled using the Talairach Daemon in Mango ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nThe results of the two meta-analyses are reported in   Table   . Converging activated brain regions for typical readers are reported on the top panel of the table. Consistent with previous research, typical readers showed activation in left frontal and temporal regions when engaging in reading-related tasks, with the largest clusters observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG; BA 44) and left precentral gyrus (BA 6). Since half of the studies included in the analysis were conducted in English, we further investigated whether the reported regions were biased toward English, which has a higher entropy between phonemes and graphemes relative to other alphabetic languages in the analysis ( ;  ). The ALE output includes a list of contributing studies, which indicate studies reporting foci within the boundary of the cluster. In the last column of   Table   , studies conducted in non-English languages were italicized. For each cluster reported in the top panel of   Table    for typical readers, studies conducted with English and non-English languages were represented, indicating cross-linguistic convergence that supports reading-related processes in alphabetic languages. However, in the lower panel, studies conducted in English and non-English languages appeared to represent different regions. \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation results, including cluster, Talairach coordinate, ALE value, volume, and contributing studies for typical and struggling readers. \n    \nAs shown in the lower panel of   Table   , struggling readers across studies showed a more distributed set of regions showing significant activations when engaging in reading-related tasks. In total, 13 clusters showed reliable activation for atypical readers. Importantly, activation is reliable even though some clusters show only a small number of contributing studies (e.g., cluster j, cluster k). Because contributing studies are only those that report foci within the boundary of the cluster, additional studies that are not listed may have contributed foci that are located near and just outside of the cluster boundary ( ). In addition, the statistically significant clusters identified here meet a stringent statistical threshold with FDR corrections (FDR = 0.01) to guard against false positives. \n\nUnlike the left lateralized regions in frontal and temporal lobes observed in the typical readers, struggling readers demonstrated activation in both left and right brain areas, covering frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Collectively, the largest cluster was observed in the left insula (BA 13) and the second largest cluster was in the right insula (BA 18). These two largest clusters were much smaller in volume compared to those reported for typical readers. No study was reported as contributing to the right medial frontal gyrus (BA 6; cluster j). The lack of contributing studies indicated no reported focus was within the boundary of this cluster, although as described above, there may be foci reported surrounding the significant cluster. Therefore, the lack of contributing studies does not invalidate the results. In regards to the potential bias of contributing studies based on language of administration, studies conducted in English seem to contribute to larger clusters. \n\nSignificant activated regions for typical and struggling readers are shown in red and blue, respectively, in   Figure   , with the overlapping regions coded as yellow. Two converging regions were observed between typical and atypical readers: the LIFG (BA 44) and the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6). Aside from these frontal regions, no converging regions were observed in the posterior brain regions. In terms of regions showing divergent activation patterns, struggling readers recruited bilateral frontal regions, parietal and occipital regions when completing reading-related tasks while typical readers showed robust activation in the inferior frontal and fusiform gyrus (BA 37). \n  \n Selective axial slices showing clusters of brain regions with significant activation in typical (red) and struggling readers (blue).   The overlapping clusters showing converging regions of activation are in yellow. \n  \n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe present study examined the distinct and overlapping brain regions in typical and struggling readers when engaging in reading-related tasks. Using ALE, 13 studies involving matching typical and struggling readers were included in the present meta-analyses. Previous work has focused on between-group contrasts of activation, highlighting particular brain regions with hyper- or hypoactivation in struggling readers compared to typical readers. The present report included separate analyses for typical developing and struggling readers. Unlike between-group contrasts of activation, these separate analyses surfaced individual activation patterns for typical and struggling readers across brain regions, respectively. In reporting these patterns separately for each group, we were additionally able to qualitatively compare brain regions across groups of typical and struggling readers. Importantly, in addition to identifying distinct regions of activation, we were able to examine common regions of shared activation between typical and atypical readers. Three major findings were observed: (1) Typical readers showed left lateralized activation in frontal and temporal areas when engaging in reading-related tasks; (2) Struggling readers showed distributed bilateral activation patterns in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions; and (3) Both typical and struggling readers showed activation in the left inferior frontal area and in the precentral area. We consider the implications of each of these results in turn. \n\nAs a complex behavior that takes years to develop and acquire, reading relies on a set of brain regions to orchestrate coherently. Consistent with previous research and meta-analysis, left lateralized regions were observed to have reliable activation across studies in the typical readers, including inferior and superior frontal regions and associative temporal areas (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). This left lateralized network reflects a set of brain regions that gradually specialized in supporting reading-related behavior. In addition to the left lateralized regions, typical readers showed reliable activation in the precentral gyrus, potentially reflecting the demand to control and produce motor responses during tasks. Given that the sample of studies in this analysis involved typical readers who are at least in middle childhood (at least age 8) and that the majority of the tasks described in   Table    involved phonological processing, it is reasonable to believe that the results observed in the typical readers were indicative of a relatively secure phonological processing system, which is an important component to reading success in alphabetic languages. \n\nThe second analysis involving struggling readers showed a bilaterally distributed activation pattern, which is consistent with previous research using empirical functional connectivity analysis (e.g.,  ). In addition to the left inferior frontal regions and the precentral regions, the struggling readers showed reliable activation patterns in the right lingual gyrus and bilaterial visual cortex. Interestingly, no activation was observed in the left fusiform gyrus. Instead, significant activation was observed in the superior parietal cortex, which was not observed in the typical readers. The inclusion criteria for the struggling readers in these studies were based on family history, clinical diagnosis, and\/or low performance on standardized reading measures. The distributed activation pattern in struggling readers may reflect the heterogeneous behavioral characteristics in the sample. However, these findings also converge with previous research pointing to hypoactivation in the left occipito-temporal region in struggling readers, a region that supports automatic word recognition. These findings support the notion that individuals with reading (and spelling) disorders may show weaker functional and structural connectivity, thereby reflecting degraded access to phonetic representations ( ). \n\nAcross all the studies, the participants were matched on demographics and background aside from their reading performance. Therefore, in the present study, we examined activation patterns that were common across the two groups to investigate their convergence and divergence in activation patterns. Two regions that both typical and struggling readers recruited to support reading-related activity were the left inferior frontal regions and the left precentral area. One implication of the significant activation observed in the left inferior frontal region may suggest top-down cognitive control relevant to reading. Recent findings offer empirical support for the importance of executive functions and other neurocognitive functions for reading ( ;  ). There is also evidence suggesting functional heterogeneity within the LIFG. For instance,   reported that activation in BA 44 was associated with lexical decision demands while activation in BA 47 was related to tasks requiring an overt motor response. In the present analysis, both typical and struggling readers showed converging activation in BA 44 (refer to   Table   ), indicating functional convergence of lexical retrieval demands in the tasks across studies. \n\nAnother overlapping region between the two groups was in the precentral area. Aside from the possibility that this region is recruited to prepare behavioral responses during tasks, it is possible that activation in the precentral area is relevant to responsiveness of auditory information ( ). In   study, children with dyslexia showed lower responses to speech in the supplementary motor area, left insula, and posterior temporal cortex. Therefore, it is possible that these are critical regions involved in the auditory processing of speech sounds or that individuals with dyslexia responded less frequently compared to their peers. A recent meta-analysis with adults also demonstrated the importance of the insula as a functional area supporting language production, comprehension, and repetition ( ). In the present analysis, struggling readers showed activation in the insula and supplementary motor area, but not in the posterior temporal cortex. In the context of previous work, this finding suggests that struggling readers may not consistently recruit these regions to support phonological processes and reading. \n\nThe observation of common regions of activation across the two groups suggested that typical and struggling readers showed convergent activation patterns in anterior regions when engaging in reading-related tasks. However, it was possible that typical and struggling readers have differential magnitudes of activation even though the same brain regions were recruited in reading-related activity ( ,  ). In addition, the divergent patterns of activation in the posterior regions suggested that struggling readers may experience difficulty in processing print as sensory information, particularly in the process of transforming graphemes (as visual stimulation) to phonemes (as auditory information). Successful reading in alphabetic languages relies on a network of brain regions. This was observed in both typical and struggling readers. Building on existing neuroimaging research on neural correlates of reading-related skills, seed-based functional connectivity analysis has great potential to further current knowledge on neural networks supporting successful reading (e.g.,  ). Results from the present analyses could be utilized as data-driven seeds supplementing the identification of seeds based on an   a priori   theoretical approach. Such efforts can indicate not only which distinct regions are relevant for reading, but also how regions operate as a network of coactivated regions in time. Understanding the network properties of the typical and atypical reading brain has the potential to inform practice in several ways: mechanisms underlying reading difficulty can be further elucidated; developmental responses in establishing integrity of reading networks can be determined; and different pathways for remediation and compensation can be examined. Targeted questions for further study should investigate the efficacy of different reading programs according to factors related to the program (i.e., focus of remediation) and to the students (e.g., reading disability characteristics, age, socioeconomic status, and cognitive abilities). \n\n### LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS \n  \nThe present analyses were limited in a few ways that can inform future research directions. First, while we included only studies involving reading in alphabetic languages, there may be language-specific considerations that limit our findings. Across different alphabetic languages, heterogeneous entropy measures have been observed between grapheme\u2013phoneme mappings ( ,  ). We also acknowledge that phonological processing may be modulated by orthographic transparency of alphabetic languages as observed in typical readers ( ) and struggling readers ( ). In fact, a recent fMRI study has demonstrated that English readers showed differential activation patterns in superior temporal gyrus when compared to readers of a more transparent language, Dutch ( ). Therefore, future meta-analysis on typical and struggling readers involving non-alphabetic scripts may complement findings in the present study. \n\nSecond, the present findings are limited by the variance in age groups and diverse experimental and baseline tasks across the included studies. The ages of typical and struggling readers were matched within individual studies, but participant age spanned a wide developmental range within each group of readers. As a result, the meta-analytic results for each group may not correspond to developmental or experiential patterns. As discussed above, qualitative differences in the activation of posterior brain regions were observed across groups. However, we acknowledge that the specific posterior brain regions that are recruited or the degree of activation of these regions is dependent on age, reading experience and tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe current meta-analyses investigated regions of activation for typical and struggling readers when they were engaged in reading-related tasks, across alphabetic languages. Building on prior work, we conducted separate meta-analyses for typical and struggling readers and through qualitative comparison identified both divergent and convergent patterns of activation. In line with prior research, typical readers showed left lateralized activation in frontal and temporal areas, while struggling readers showed diffuse activation in bilateral frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. In addition, we found convergent regions of activation in the left inferior frontal and precentral areas. With a highly complex behavior such as reading, the learning experience refines the orchestration of a network of brain regions. Based on the results in the present study, reading difficulty is associated with a disruption in the functional activation patterns of key components in the reading brain network. However, the mechanism underlying this functional disruption and how it relates to behavior requires further investigation, considering a developmental framework. Future research taking a network approach investigating the relationship between brain function, brain structure and behavior will shed light on how typical and atypical reading develops. More importantly, designing innovative interventions or support systems for struggling readers may benefit from understanding the similarity and differences in brain and behavior. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4354279,"text_md5":"794de49b4ff9e3d229794dc2527826ae","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,74],"publication_year":[76,80],"title":[91,221],"keywords":[235,329],"abstract":[342,2097],"body":[2106,33817]},"batch":1,"pmid":25806009,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.00191","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4354279","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4354279"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4354279\">4354279<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4354279  A meta-analysis of functional reading systems in typically developing and struggling readers across different alphabetic languages"}

The aim of this research was to investigate the brain activity patterns associated with viewing food stimuli in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nElectronic databases including PsycInfo and PubMed were systematically searched from data base inception until 1st of December 2020, identifying 14 suitable functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI), involving 470 participants.

In addition, patients with AN showed hyperactivations in cognitive control areas (i.e., prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex). In contrast, patients with BN exhibited hyperactivations in brain areas related to reward processing (i.e., lentiform nucleus), and interoceptive processing (i.e., insula). Furthermore, patients with BN showed hypoactivations in brain regions associated with cognitive control (i.e., prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur study shows differing neural endotypes of the two types of eating disorders, that underpin their behavioural phenotypes. While exploratory in nature, these findings might be relevant for guiding new emerging therapies, including invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques in treatment of eating disorders. \n\n\n## Level of evidence \n  \nLevel I, meta-analysis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are psychiatric disorders with a very high burden of disease. Eating disorder patients commonly suffer several medical complications involving endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal and neurological systems [ ]. Consequently, eating disorders are associated with increased rates of mortality compared with the general population [ ], and individuals with AN have the highest mortality rates of all other psychiatric disorders [ ,  ].\n \n\nAN and BN feature overlapping (such as fixation on weight and appearance) as well as distinct symptoms (such as extreme restriction of calorie intake vs. binging and purging) [ ]. While several factors including sociocultural, psychological and biological aspects have been suggested to contribute to the development and maintenance of these eating disorders, the aetiology is still inconclusive [ ].\n \n\nAnalogous with several other psychiatric illnesses, there has been increasing research surrounding the underlying neurobiological links associated with the contribution and maintenance of eating disorders [ ]. Various neurobiological models have utilised symptom categories to explore the underlying neural correlates, both AN and BN share and what contributes to their differing clinical presentations [ ]. For example, food restriction is a key characteristic of AN, and imbalances in the brain systems involved in emotion, reward processes and decision-making processes, have been implicated in AN presentation [ ]. By contrast, high levels of impulsivity and a lack of inhibition-control leading to binge-eating can be demonstrated in BN, and differences in these neural correlates compared to AN have been suggested [ ,  ]. \n\nReward processing has been proposed to have an integral role in accounting for extreme differences in food intake between individuals presenting with eating disorders [ ]. Individuals with anorexia commonly report anhedonia, an impaired ability to derive pleasure from usually enjoyable activities [ ]. Instead, food restriction is thought to be perceived as initially rewarding, due to weight-related cognitions, and subsequently, sustained due to the conditioning of the reward [ ,  ]. Reduced reward sensitivity has been demonstrated in individuals with AN, with an increased ability to delay monetary rewards for example [ ]. In contrast, individuals with BN report increased novelty seeking and reward sensitivity [ ]. The complex neural mechanisms underlying reward processing employ multiple brain regions [ ] to perform a series of sub-processes, including reward anticipation reward association, re-appraisal of reward value, and reward-seeking behaviour regulation. Key areas are the striatum, predominantly the including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [ ], as well as the amygdala [ ]. \n\nSecond, interoceptive processing refers to the perception of one\u2019s physiological functions, such as fullness, hunger, and taste [ ]. Interoception centers on the anterior insula, through which the peripheral nervous system communicates to the limbic and cortical control centres of homeostasis [ ,  ]. Due to individuals with eating disorders displaying abnormal perceptions of hunger, theories have suggested that impaired interoceptive processing has contributed to the maintenance of their disorders [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nFinally, cognitive control regions are interconnected with both, reward-related regions and areas involved in interoception, and are considered to modulate eating behavior [ ,  ,  ]. Chiefly, the prefrontal cortex, is thought to integrate goals, affective valence, interoceptive states, and sensory input to guide control functions, such as behavioural inhibition, planning and decision making [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Furthermore, the anterior cingulate cortex performs additional executive functions associated with affect-value attribution, emotional regulation, and conflict monitoring [ ]. Finally, the orbitofrontal cortex aids in subjective value attribution and decision making [ ,  ].\n \n\n\n## Using neuroimaging to investigate the mechanisms of eating disorders \n  \nRecent advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed for an increase in research surrounding the underlying neural mechanisms associated with the initiation and maintenance of eating disorders [ ]. Especially, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the most popular neuroimaging tool, has led to substantial advancements in the understanding of neurobiological models of eating disorders [ ]. \n\nWhile the use of fMRI studies to identify neural regions associated with eating disorders has been undoubtedly advantageous, the findings are inherently variable. fMRI studies often use relatively small sample sizes, which can lead to issues with replicability and false positive results [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, inconsistencies between existing fMRI studies investigating eating disorders are not uncommon, which makes drawing conclusion about the neurobiological underpinnings problematic [ ]. \n\nTo address these limitations, coordinate-based meta-analysis can be used. This method statistically establishes concurrence across fMRI studies by pooling activation data [ ,  ]. Pooling data across similar studies allows for increased statistical power, determines inter-study trends, and enables findings occurring by chance to be separated from the consistent results [ ]. One of the most widely used tools for coordinate-based meta-analysis is Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n### Current study \n  \nThe aim of this study was to conduct a systematic ALE meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies to explore the commonalities and differences in brain activation patterns associated with AN and BN, relative to healthy controls (HC). Given the relevance of food for eating disorders, this review focused on task-based fMRI studies that required participants to observe food stimuli. \n\n\n### Hypotheses \n  \n  \nWe hypothesised that when looking at food stimuli, AN patients would show hypoactivity (i.e., reduced activity) in the brain regions related to reward processing, relative to HC. In contrast, we predicted BN patients to show hyperactivity (i.e., increased activity), relative to HC. \n  \nWe hypothesised that when looking at food stimuli, both AN and BN patients would exhibit abnormal activity, relative to HC, in brain regions related to interoceptive processing. \n  \nWe hypothesised that patients with AN would show hyperactivity in brain regions related to cognitive control, while individuals with BN would show hypoactivity, both relative to HC. \n  \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nThe review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items fo Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [ ] (see Fig.  ).   \nPrisma flowchart of search and selection procedure \n  \n\n\n### Search strategy, eligibility criteria and data extraction \n  \nThe electronic databases employed for the search included PsycInfo and PubMed. To identify additional relevant studies, manual searches within the reference lists of examined studies were conducted. All relevant published journal articles, with no year limits were included in the search. The key terms used were (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d) AND (\u201cAnorexia Nervosa\u201d OR \u201cBulimia\u201d OR \"Eating Disorder\u201d). After screening for duplicates, the titles and abstracts and of 631 studies were independently assessed by two reviewers for the following criteria: (a) involving patients with AN or BN in ill state (i.e., not recovered); (b) using task-based fMRI (i.e., no resting-state studies); (c) written in English. This initial screening stage led to the rejection of 451 articles. The full-text of the remaining 180 articles were independently assessed by two reviewers for the following additional criteria: (e) using tasks focused on food stimuli; (f) involving a statistical contrast of a patient sample (AN or BN) relative to a HC sample. This led to the exclusion of a further 164 articles. Finally, two articles were excluded for not reporting activation coordinates (i.e., those two studies used an region of interest-based approach). The final sample of studies comprised, therefore, 14 studies (see Table  ). From those studies two reviewers independently extracted the type of disorder (i.e., AN, BN, and HC), the sample size, the tasks performed, and the fMRI activation coordinates.   \nStudies included ALE meta-analysis \n  \nThe Holsen et al. (2012) study used the DSM-IV weight criterion for AN (i.e.,\u2009<\u200985th percentile of normal body weight). According to the ICD-10 criterion for AN (BMI\u2009\u2264\u200917.5), some patients would be considered weight restored \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nTo identify the commonalities and differences in brain pattern associated with AN and BN, an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis was performed, using GingerALE software Version 3.0.2 [ ,  ,  ]. ALE is a method for conducting coordinate-based meta-analysis to statically analyse the overlap of activation foci from different fMRI studies [ ]. For each included study, the software generates a model activation (MA) map by merging each study\u2019s total foci coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ). Individual MA maps are then combined across studies to form an ALE map. This ALE map provides a statistical map of consistent activations across studies [ ,  ]. To account for risk of bias, GingerALE applies an uncertainty of random effects model. To account for the natural variability across participants spatial smoothing is also applied. That is, the analysis models foci as Gaussian probability distributions, using a Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM), allowing for the smoothing of data over nearby voxels. The distribution width reflects study size, with larger sample sizes weighted more strongly than smaller sample sizes [ ,  ]. To control for the problem of multiple comparisons within the same voxel resulting in false positive clusters, a cluster level FWE threshold was employed [ ]. Specifically, statistical contrasts were computed using a height threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.1 and a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons), based on 1000 permutations, which is considered an optimal thresholding level [ ,  ]. To be able to combine and compare activation patterns form different studies it is necessary to use normalised data within the same stereotaxic space [ ]. The icbm2tal conversation algorithm, as implemented in GingerALE, was used to convert any activation foci reported in Talairach space to MNI space [ ]. To view and display the activation likelihood maps produced by GingerALE coordinates, Mango version 2.5 software was used ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical contrasts \n  \nTo identify how brain patterns associated with viewing food images in AN and BN differ from those in HC, four between group contrast analyses were conducted. (1). Testing for hyperactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in AN relative to HC (AN\u2009>\u2009HC). (2). Testing for hypoactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in AN relative to HC (HC\u2009>\u2009AN). (3). Testing for hyperactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in BN relative to HC (BN\u2009>\u2009HC). (4). Testing for hypoactivated brain regions when viewing food stimuli in BN relative to HC (HC\u2009>\u2009BN). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Anorexia nervosa vs. healthy controls \n  \nThe analysis was based on nine individual studies and revealed four clusters that showed significantly higher activity in AN patients relative to controls (i.e., hyperactivations related to viewing food images) that were located bilaterally in areas related to cognitive control (i.e., the frontal and cingulate cortex), as well as cerebellum (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). The reverse comparison revealed 11 clusters that showed significantly lower activity in anorexia patients compared to HC (i.e., hypoactivations related to viewing food images). Hypoactivated brain areas included those related to reward processing (i.e., amygdala and striatum) and interoceptive processing (i.e., insula). Additional areas of hypoactivations included the parietal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and lingual gyrus (see Fig.\u00a0 , and Table  ).   \nHyperactivations and Hypoactivations in Patients in AN \n    \nAN hyperactivations and hypoactivation relative to HC \n  \nAnatomical locations and spatial coordinates of ALE analysis showing significant activations (with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) \n\n BA   brodmann area \n  \n\nBrain regions showing hyperactivations (red) and hypoactivations (green) in patients with AN compared to HC.

In addition, there was significant hyperactivity in the bilateral cerebellum) (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table 4). The reverse comparison revealed seven clusters that showed significantly lower activity in BN patients compared to HC (i.e., hypoactivations related to viewing food images). Hypoactivated brain areas included predominantly those related to cognitive control (prefrontal and cingulate cortex). Additional areas of hypoactivations included the precunues and temporal cortex (see Fig.\u00a0 , and Table  ).   \nHyperactivations and Hypoactivations in Patients in BN \n    \nBN hyperactived and hypoactivated brain regions when looking at food images relative to HC \n  \nAnatomical locations and spatial coordinates of ALE analysis showing significant activations (with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) \n\n BA   brodmann area \n  \n\nBrain regions showing hyperactivations (red) and hypoactivations (green) in patients with BN compared to HC; contrasts were computed with a cluster-defining threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons.

In contrast, BN patients were predicted to show hyperactivity in brain regions related to reward processing. The results of the ALE analysis supported both predictions, by showing decreased activity in amygdala and striatum for the anorexia group and increased striatal activity for the bulimia group. Second, we hypothesized that when looking at food stimuli, both AN and BN patients would exhibit abnormal activity, relative to HC, in brain regions related to interoceptive processing. Again, the results of the ALE analysis supported both predictions, showing decreased insula activity for the anorexia group, and increased activity for the bulimia group. Finally, we hypothesised that patients with AN would show hyperactivity in brain regions related to cognitive control, while individuals with BN would show hypoactivity, both relative to HC. Also here, the ALE analyses supported the predictions; the AN group showed increased activity in cognitive-control-related areas (i.e., prefrontal cortex) relative to the HC group, while the BC group exhibited an inverse pattern (i.e., decreased activity of the prefrontal cortex). \n\nThe first key finding of the ALE analysis was decreased activity in amygdala and striatum for the anorexia group and increased striatal activity for the bulimia group. The amygdala is known to be play a central role in emotional processing [ ] and conditioned learning, such as punishment anticipation and reward learning [ ,  ]. The decreased activity in the anorexia group is, therefore, likely indicative that food rewards are indeed less rewarding. These findings are also in line with fMRI studies focused on gustatory perception which observed reduced amygdala activation in AN patients in response to taste stimuli [ ,  ]. \n\nIn addition, we identified decreased activity in the striatum for the anorexia group and increased activity in the bulimia group. The activation cluster covered both, the ventral and dorsal striatum. The ventral striatum is well known for its role in reward-related behaviour [ ], but also the dorsal striatum is known to respond to reward stimuli [ ], even though it is better known for its role in habit learning [ ]. In addition, the dorsal striatum had been found to mediate behaviours involving eating, particularly of highly palatable, high-calorie foods [ ,  ]. As individuals with AN are known to typically avoid high-calorie foods, whereas bulimia patient embrace it [ ,  ], this in line with the differential brain activity patterns observed in this study. \n\nDistinctions between the two patient groups in terms of reward processing are also indicated by differential activity patterns in visual cortex, i.e., we found decreased activity in anorexia patients and increased activity in bulimia patients, suggesting different degrees of visual attention being paid to food stimuli. Decreased activation in visual processing areas found in AN subjects may indicate they are employing cognitive strategies to show less attention towards the stimuli to support and maintain the anorexic state [ ]. In contrast, BN individuals\u2019 increased engagement towards the food stimuli, together with increased reward processing brain regions, suggests they display a heightened reward sensitivity towards food [ ]. \n\nThe second key finding of our analysis was decreased insula activity for the anorexia group, and increased activity for the bulimia group. Those activity patterns suggest that higher activity relates to greater interoceptive responsiveness, such as increased feelings of hunger or appetite in bulimia patients [ ]. In contrast, the lower-than-normal activity in the anorexia group suggests, therefore, less interoceptive responsiveness to food stimuli [ ], and potentially impaired ability to recognise internal hunger cues [ ,  ]. \n\nFinally, our prediction of brain activity patterns indicative of lower-than-normal cognitive control in the bulimia group, and increased cognitive control in the anorexia group were supported by the ALE results. More specifically, the AN group displayed hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex, inclusion specifically medial and lateral prefrontal areas that form part of the cognitive control network, governing effortful regulation of affective valence, selective attention, and inhibition control [ ,  ,  ]. Increased activity of this network in the AN group is likely to represent a compensatory attempt to exert cognitive control over emotional and reward responses from food stimuli. Overall, these findings suggest an increased responsiveness in terms of monitoring and regulating emotions and food-related motivations, which subsequently lead to restrictive appetitive behavioural responses commonly seen in individuals with AN [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, BN patients displayed hypoactivity in the prefrontal control network, suggesting a decreased responsiveness in terms of monitoring and modulating the emotions and reward-related motivations that the food stimuli may induce [ ]. Therefore, this indicates that individuals with BN have less effective cognitive control, thus allowing for their heightened appetitive and reward systems to impinge, eventually resulting in binge eating behaviours [ ,  ]. Our observations are also in line with studies showing reduced prefrontal activity in individuals with BN during tasks that require (non-food-related) response inhibition tasks [ ,  ]. Furthermore, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the prefrontal cortex has been found to reduce food cravings in women prone to strong food cravings [ ] and to binge eating [ ]. \n\nInterestingly, both AN and BN patients showed hyperactivity in the cerebellum relative to HC. While not directly related to our hypotheses, this finding indicates a functional role for the cerebellum in the control of feeding behaviour. A cluster of nuclei within the cerebellum have been previously shown to have an inhibitory effect on glucose-sensitive neurons within the hypothalamus, suggesting a role in blood glucose homeostasis through regulation of food intake [ ]. Another explanation may lie in the emerging evidence of a role of the cerebellum in the perception and regulation of emotions through its connectivity with the limbic networks [ ]. \n\n### Strength and limits \n  \nTo allow for valid conclusions, quantitative meta-analysis require a high degree comparability and constancy across the included studies. We, therefore, restricted the analysis on studies that involve viewing of food stimuli. While this ensures a high degree of internal consistency and validity it also limits the generalizability of the findings. For instance, our study does not provide insights into other facets of eating disorder, such as those related to body image. Our stringent exclusion criteria also resulted in a relatively low number of included studies (i.e., 14 studies, involving 470 participants) and the results should be, therefore, considered explorative in nature. It is important to note though that pooling data across a relatively small number of studies still has considerable advantages compared to results based on single studies. The evidence base in our analysis was also still sufficiently large to allow for stringent statistical thresholding (i.e., FWE correction), which provides a high level of confidence in the reliability of the results. A larger sample of studies would, however, also permit assessing effects of duration of illness on brain activation patterns. Structural imaging work has indicated that prolonged AN is associated with atrophy specifically in the cerebellum [ ]. Nevertheless, in the current study, the typical duration of illness was comparable for the two disorders (Median \u2009=\u20097.2\u00a0years; Median \u2009=\u20097.5\u00a0years) and is, therefore, not a probable source of bias. \n\nAnother limitation to this study was that the AN sample was not split by restricting and binge-purge subtypes. While the minimum severity BMI criteria is still required for both subtypes of AN [ ], it has been argued that the clinical features of AN binge-purge subtype may align more with BN symptomology in relation to eating behaviours [ ,  ]. While many of the included studies in this meta-analysis reported the importance of considering AN by subtypes, the majority of these studies subsequently did not split their data by subtypes, due to limitations of small sample sizes [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nFinally, while ALE is the most commonly meta-analytical tool for fMRI data, it is not the only approach. Seed-Based Analysis (also known as SDM) is an alternative approach, which in contrast to ALE takes also the effect size of included studies into consideration [ \u2013 ]. It is important to note that differences in meta-analytical approaches might lead to some degree of variability in the outcomes. \n\nDespite this limitation our study provides a valuable summative assessment of the distinct the neural mechanisms underpinning eating disorders, which in turn might guide targeted future interventions, such as neuromodulation approaches treatments [ ]. \n\n\n\n## What is already know on the subject? \n  \nSeveral existing fMRI studies have investigated the neural mechanisms underpinning AN and BN. There is, however, a large degree of variability among the results. \n\n\n## What your study adds? \n  \nUsing an ALE meta-analysis approach, allowed us to identify unique as well as overlapping brain activity for AN and BN relative to HC. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9556419,"text_md5":"63ca5caddc7c13fd16abf10c9b34644a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,59],"journal":[60,77],"publication_year":[79,83],"title":[94,258],"keywords":[272,326],"abstract":[339,2157],"body":[2166,26672]},"batch":1,"pmid":35304713,"doi":"10.1007\/s40519-022-01390-x","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9556419","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9556419"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9556419\">9556419<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9556419  Neural correlates associated with processing food stimuli in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}
{"text":"Tench, Christopher R. and Tanasescu, Radu and Auer, Dorothee P. and Constantinescu, Cris S.\nPLoS One, 2013\n\n# Title\n\nCoordinate Based Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data; False Discovery Control and Diagnostics\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nCoordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) is widely used to find regions of consistent activation across fMRI studies that have been selected for their functional relevance to a given hypothesis. Only reported coordinates (foci), and a model of their spatial uncertainty, are used in the analysis. Results are clusters of foci where multiple studies have reported in the same spatial region, indicating functional relevance. There are several published methods that perform the analysis in a voxel-wise manner, resulting in around 10  statistical tests, and considerable emphasis placed on controlling the risk of type 1 statistical error. Here we address this issue by dramatically reducing the number of tests, and by introducing a new false discovery rate control: the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR). FCDR is particularly interpretable and relevant to the results of CBMA, controlling the type 1 error by limiting the proportion of clusters that are expected under the null hypothesis. We also introduce a data diagnostic scheme to help ensure quality of the analysis, and demonstrate its use in the example studies. We show that we control the false clusters better than the widely used ALE method by performing numerical experiments, and that our clustering scheme results in more complete reporting of structures relevant to the functional task. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nReports of functional neuroimaging studies summarise locations of significant activation or deactivation related to specific tasks. These almost always include coordinates (foci) in Talairach   or in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Similar studies are often performed independently by different centres, and coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) of such studies has been developed with the aim of combining the results and performing statistical inference on them  \u2013 . The output of these meta-analyses is a set of voxel clusters located where studies commonly report activation. The clusters then indicate which brain structures are involved in the specific task. \n\nPossibly the most widely known of the CBMA methods are the kernel density analysis (KDA)   and the activation likelihood estimate (ALE)  . The KDA method models spatial uncertainty of each focus by a uniform sphere of specified radius (\u223c10 mm). The ALE method models the uncertainty with a Gaussian function with full width half max (FWHM) \u223c10 mm. KDA seeks clusters of significantly high density of reported foci. The ALE method estimates the probability that there is a focus in any given voxel. The union of probabilities (the ALE) over all reported foci then reflects the probability that there is at least one focus within a voxel, and clusters of significantly high ALE are tested for. \n\nBoth KDA and ALE methods have undergone evolutionary development. They have recently shifted towards emphasis on study  ,  , rather than the individual foci, preventing individual studies having excessive influence. A further development recognises the possible relationship between foci reported within study  ,  . \n\nRecently the signed differential mapping (SDM) method for CBMA of neuroimaging data has been introduced  , and incorporates features from both the KDA and ALE methods. This was originally devised for analysis of grey matter changes, and was required to account for both increases and decreases in grey matter density. The method has recently been updated to allow the inclusion of extra statistical parametric maps in the analysis  . Much of the focus of this method is on strict inclusion criteria for studies. \n\nThe KDA, ALE, and SDM methods perform voxel-wise analysis. While the recent changes to the ALE method have relatively minor impact  , it has been shown that different approaches to type 1 error control of the high number of statistical tests (testing in every voxel, so \u223c10  tests) involved can have a major impact  . Originally the ALE method simply specified a conservative level for rejecting the null hypothesis  ; the SDM method also employs a conservative threshold  . Later, control of the false discovery rate (FDR)   was imposed  . However, control of the FDR may be problematical when the tests are not independent  , which they are not for this problem  . Furthermore, testing of individual voxels has been shown to be inappropriate in voxel-wise fMRI analysis, with tests that consider the topological features of clusters of voxels being preferred  ,  . Consequently, an empirical cluster level control has recently been introduced, whereby the size of significant clusters computed under a randomisation of the foci is used; clusters are declared significant only if large compared to those observed under randomisation  . The KDA method uses a conservative family wise error rate (FWER) control; this has less power than FDR  , but fewer false positives. In the updated MKDA method, a cluster size threshold is also imposed, which is similar to that used with the ALE method. \n\nHere we detail a new algorithm for coordinate based meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies that: (1) tackles the issue with large numbers of statistical tests and type 1 error control, (2) uses a new clustering algorithm to give more complete reporting of the results, and (3) includes a diagnostic tool to highlight potential problems with the data. Our method is based on the ALE algorithm, which is implemented in the freely available GingerALE ( ) software; but also has some features in common with the KDA method. The most apparent differences are that we truncate the Gaussian functions to contain only 95% of their mass, so they have a reduced sphere of influence similar to the KDA\/MKDA method. Furthermore, we perform hypothesis testing only at the reported foci, rather than at each voxel, reducing the number of statistical tests performed (\u223c10 ) dramatically. For these reasons we call our method LocalALE. Consequently it is computationally feasible to generate and store many complete experiments under our null hypothesis and analyse the resulting p-values. We can then control the FDR whilst directly taking account of the dependences between the multiple tests. Another new feature of our algorithm is the clustering scheme, which is important both for reporting of the meta-analysis results, and for our new type 1 error control scheme: false cluster discovery rate (FCDR) control. We estimate the expected number of significant clusters within the null generated experiments to control the FCDR, which is directly relevant to the results, and is more interpretable than FDR; it is a similar principle to FDR, but applied to clusters, rather than tests. The use of FCDR in a voxel-wise CBMA would be computationally very intensive, since it would require storage and processing of many (thousands) images. Similar control mechanisms have previously been described for controlling false positive results applicable to functional MRI  ,  . \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### The spatial distribution for reported foci \n  \nThe   i   focus from study   j   is located at r    and has associated with it a spatial distribution. which is Gaussian with standard deviation \u03c3. The weight term   w   normalises the function appropriately, and allows the contribution of each study to be weighted independently, as suggested by  . We use \n\nThis function truncates the spatial distribution to 95% of its mass (2.8\u03c3), and weights its value by \u03bd   . One suggested weighting is an appropriately normalised square root of the number of subjects in the study  ; the studies with larger numbers of subjects are generally considered more robust. However, other factors, such as the significance of the activation or the volume of the activation are also important; unfortunately these are often reported in an inconsistent way. In this study we do not include any weighting factors. \n\n\n### The Spatial Distribution for a Single Study \n  \nThis function describes the spatial uncertainty for all foci from a single study. \n\nThe   MA   relates only to the nearest focus to point r, and was introduced as the modelled activation (MA) in the ALE method  . \n\n\n### The ALE \n  \nThe ALE is a function of the MA values  , \n\nThis is the test statistic we will use in our hypothesis tests. High values indicate a consistent activation across studies. \n\n\n### Testing for Statistically Significant Clusters of Foci \n  \nPseudo code for the meta-analysis algorithm is given in  . \n\nIt is hypothesised that the studies are related by task\/stimulus such that foci are reported more consistently across studies in regions that are important to the task\/stimulus. It is these consistently reported regions that are of interest in CBMA, and the ALE is the measure of this consistency; higher ALE values being indicative of more consistent reporting. For hypothesis testing a null distribution of ALE values is needed. The null distribution for CBMA might be obtained by measuring the ALE in experiments using reported foci from studies that are not related by task\/stimulus; with the constraints that the number of foci in each study and the number of studies in the experiments are kept the same. However, this may not be practical. By assuming that the foci are independent and uniformly distributed throughout either the grey matter (GM) only as suggested in  ,  , or throughout the whole brain (WB), a Monte Carlo simulation can be used to computationally generate a null distribution  . While this assumption is not strictly valid, it does provide a quantitative scheme for assessing significance in CBMA, and been employed in the various algorithms  ,  . However, the distribution of ALE values directly depends on the distribution of MA values. In some studies foci are reported such that they overlap (are separated by a distance <2.8\u03c3) spatially to form clusters, and this affects the MA distribution. In common with the most recent versions of the ALE and MKDA methods, we recognise that within study overlapping foci can form meaningful clusters that should be preserved under randomisation  ,  ; the aim being to preserve the distribution of MA values. \n\nOur randomisation algorithm is similar to that reported in  . Overlapping clusters of foci within the observed studies are identified and for each such cluster (  i  ) the centroid (   R     ), the mean distance (  d  ) of the within-cluster foci from the centroid, and variance of that distance (  S  ), are computed. Each cluster centroid is then randomised to a voxel in the mask (GM or WB) with uniform probability. Each focus (  j  ) that forms part of cluster   i   is then randomly located at a distance   (  is a truncated Normal distribution such that   to cut off the long tails of the distribution) from the centroid, in a random direction    e      (random vector with uniform probability density on a sphere of radius 1). For this to be a valid randomisation two constraints must be met: 1) the foci should all fall within the mask, and 2) no two centroids (  l   &   m  ) must be closer than   d +d +S +S +  2.8\u03c3 avoid significant overlapping of the foci when randomised; although with few reported foci per study, overlapping is a relatively rare event even without this constraint. If the randomisation is not valid, it is repeated until the two constraints are met. Again this randomisation of foci is not ideal, but provides a quantitative way of gauging the significances in CBMA that depends directly on the studies included in the analysis. \n\nTo compute p-values the ALE value for each reported focus is first computed using  ) and (4). Now   ALE  (r   ) is the ALE of focus   i  ; note we have now dropped the study index for simplicity. In the   j  th randomisation the   i  th focus is randomised to location v    and the ALE value is   ALE  (v   ). The p-value of the   k  th focus is then where the sum is over the total number of foci (  N  ) in the experiment and the number of randomisations (  N  ), and   I  (E) is an indicator function that is 1 if E is true and 0 otherwise. \n\n\n### Controlling the False Discovery Rate and False Cluster Discovery Rate \n  \nControl of type 1 statistical error in neuroimaging is of huge importance, and the adaptive FDR control (BH-FDR) introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg   is often employed. The scheme estimates the number of falsely rejected hypotheses from   N   independent tests of level \u03b1 as \u03b1  N  . It then attempts to find the test level where this estimate is at most some small percentage (say 5%) of the number of rejections. There are, however, problems when applied to voxel-wise analysis or fMRI. Firstly the tests in neighbouring voxels are not independent. Secondly, it is not the voxels themselves, but rather clusters of voxels, that should ideally be controlled  ,  . Here we detail an FDR method where the numbers of false rejections are estimated directly from many realisations of the experiment generated under the null hypothesis; solving the issue with independence. We then go on to generalise the method to the control of false clusters. \n\nIn LocalALE hypothesis tests are performed only at the foci, rather than at every voxel. Consequently, many (  N  ) randomised (as described above) experiments can be generated under the null hypothesis computationally feasible requirements; these will be called null experiments to distinguish them from the observed experiment, which consists of the studies included in the meta-analysis. If the   l  th focus in the   m  th null experiment is located at   \u03c1  , then its p-value   \u03c0   is estimated by. \n\nin exactly the same way as the p-values are estimated for the observed foci. The expected number of false positives for any level \u03b1 of test, is then \n\nIf the null is rejected   R   times in the observed experiment, then the FDR is controlled at a level \u03b3 by maximising \u03b1 such that   E \/R   \u2264 \u03b3, with \u03b1\u2264\u03b3. Typically, for example, the FDR is controlled at 5%, so \u03b1 would be maximised, but at most 0.05, such that the expected number of false positives,   E  , is at most 5% of the total number of rejected hypotheses   R  . \n\nIntuitively, controlling at the cluster level makes considerable sense, as ultimately it is the significant clusters that form the results. In the ALE   and MKDA   methods, a randomisation procedure is performed and a distribution for the size (number of voxels) of any resulting clusters is generated. The distribution is then used to set a minimum cluster size threshold in the meta-analysis; combined with either FWER or FDR. Here, rather than restricting results to large clusters, FDR is generalised to FCDR control; control of the expected proportion of clusters that are false. The process is exactly analogous to FDR. The p-value is computed for each focus in the null experiments using  ) and, for a level \u03b1 of test, the expected number of falsely significant clusters estimated and compared to the number of clusters declared significant in the observed data; the number of significant clusters is counted using the algorithm detailed in  . Typically the FCDR is controlled at 5%, so \u03b1 would be maximised, but at most 0.05, such that the expected number of false clusters is at most 5% of the total number of clusters from the observed experiment. \n\n\n### Reporting the Results \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis are reported in two ways.  \u2013  are used to compute an image of ALE values using only the foci declared significant by the analysis. The ALE of the focus with the smallest p-value, but which is not significant, is used to threshold the ALE image. A cluster report is also generated, which consists of the ALE weighted (by the ALE at each focus in the cluster) centroid for each cluster of significant foci and the nearest GM Talairach structure to the centroid, indicating which Talairach structures are important to the task. \n\n\n### Study Diagnostics: Study Overlap Score \n  \nMuch of meta-analysis methodology concerns the study inclusion criteria. It is vital to include all studies that test appropriate hypotheses in an appropriate manner. On the other hand it is vital to exclude studies where some methodological problem makes the results in some way inappropriate for the analysis. Furthermore, the act of extracting data for the meta-analysis is often laborious, and can be prone to human error. After a study has met the inclusion criteria, it is prudent to check that it appears commensurate with the other studies. An indication that it is not is useful for diagnostic purposes, and helps pinpoint studies that should be scrutinised further. Data errors can then be fixed, and, if justifiable, studies excluded. \n\nHow commensurate each study is with all others is quantified by measuring the overlap of foci between studies. The ALE is computed for each focus within a study, and then averaged. Then each focus within that study is independently randomised, with uniform probability to a voxel in the mask, and the mean ALE recomputed. This is repeated for each study 1000 times, and the proportion of times the mean ALE in the observed study is greater than that under randomisation estimated. A proportion close to one indicates that the study reports foci in similar locations to the other studies. A small proportion indicates overlap that is similar to randomised foci, and that the study should be scrutinised further, and any data extraction errors fixed. \n\n\n### Experiments \n  \nExperiments involving numerically simulated data, and real study data, were performed. Comparisons of results from LocalALE and the latest version of GingerALE   were made. We set GingerALE to use its most conservative FDR method  , controlling at a level of 0.05. Furthermore, we set the lower volume threshold for a significant cluster at 360 mm  (45 voxels, as used in  ). In LocalALE, we used a WB Talairach mask to generate the null samples (although we also compare with the GM mask), FWHM of the foci was 10 mm, no weighting was applied, and FDR and FCDR were controlled at a level of 0.05. Convergent results were obtained using 10000 permutations for hypothesis testing, and two thousand null studies generated for FDR or FCDR control; increasing these numbers did not change the experiment outcome. \n\nThe WB mask is the Colin Talairach image obtained from the brainmap.org website. For the GM mask we performed affine registration of the ICBM 452 T1 structural atlas ( ) to the Talairach image. The registration parameters were then applied to the GM tissue class image only, and subsequently a threshold applied to the image to leave only the bulk grey matter. \n\nAll Coordinates Used were in Talairach Space. \n\n#### Experiment 1 \n  \nTesting the randomisation of foci. To test our randomisation procedure we extract data from a thermal pain stimulus study (from experiment 5), which reports 71 foci that overlap to form 15 clusters. We calculate the MA for each voxel of the GM mask using  . We obtain the distribution of MA values for the observed data, then randomise the foci as described in the methods section. We then re-compute the distribution of MA values and average over 100 independent randomisations. The two distributions are then compared. We expect the distributions to be similar, on average, if our cluster preserving randomisation algorithm works as required. For comparison we also compute the distribution of MA values for foci randomised independently. \n\n\n#### Experiment 2 \n  \nRandom experiments. We aimed to examine the frequency of obtaining false clusters using a randomised set of foci as a test of type 1 error control. We used the face perception experiment reported in  , which has 19 studies looking at brain activation evoked by visually presented faces, and 173 foci; these data were specifically chosen since they allow us to perform cluster level control within GingerALE using the lower cluster size threshold of 45 voxels (360 mm ), as reported in  . The foci were randomised independently throughout the GM mask, and meta-analysis performed, 1000 times. We estimated the frequency of obtaining false clusters using LocalALE on controlling the FDR, FCDR, and BH-FDR. One hundred of these randomised experiments were also performed using GingerALE for comparison. \n\n\n#### Experiment 3 \n  \nFace perception. We repeat the face perception experiment reported in  . We examine the diagnostic overlap scores, and perform meta-analysis on the data. Reports of significant clusters found by GingerALE and LocalALE are given. Study data was downloaded from the brainmap database using Sleuth ( )  \u2013 . \n\n\n#### Experiment 4 \n  \nRandomising non-significant foci from the face perception experiment. Foci in the face perception data are randomised independently and with uniform probability, except for those that contribute to the significant clusters obtained by LocalALE using FCDR; allowing us to examine the false positive control in the presence of known significant clusters. We then perform meta-analysis on the new set of foci, using GingerALE and LocalALE, to observe if new significant clusters occur out of the randomisation. We expect the original clusters to be present still and few new clusters if the false positives are well controlled. We run the experiment 1000 times using LocalALE, and 100 times using GingerALE, and produce a histogram of the number of extra significant clusters detected. \n\n\n#### Experiment 5 \n  \nMeta-analysis of thermal pain stimulation in healthy volunteers. To compare the algorithms in a larger experiment, we perform meta-analysis of thermal pain stimulation, which has been widely studied using fMRI. Extensive functional activation is observed with pain stimulus, so this experiment allows us to test our clustering scheme, which makes use of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm  , given in  . \n\nA search for fMRI studies of experimental thermal-induced pain in healthy people was performed through standard literature databases (ScienceDirect, and PubMed). We used the keywords fMRI and thermal or pain. The references of these articles were then assessed for additional studies that could be considered for inclusion. We excluded single-subject reports, studies using a-priori region of interest (ROI) based analyses, and studies that reported only a restricted field of view. Only activation foci were included. Thirty eight articles were retained, with a total of 49 experiments including 616 subjects and 816 foci. If the pain stimulus was applied on the left, reported foci were reflected about x\u200a=\u200a0. Reports of significant clusters found by GingerALE and LocalALE are given. We also examine the diagnostic overlap scores for this data. \n\nTo test the sensitivity of FCDR to the clustering algorithm, we also analyse the pain data using a simplified clustering scheme; we used the same algorithm detailed in   except for the constraints on the ALE, which were removed. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Testing the Randomisation Algorithm \n  \n depicts the MA values (overlaid) and clustering within study is clearly evident. The distribution of MA values (>0 only) is shown on the histogram, along with the distribution when the foci have been randomised. When the foci are randomised to preserve within experiment clusters, as described in the methods section, the MA distribution is conserved on average. Randomising the foci independently and with uniform probability through the mask increases the frequency of low MA values as the foci spread out more. The percentage of voxels with zero MA (not shown) is 76% for the observed foci, a similar 77% on average when randomised to preserve clusters, and a lower 68% on average when randomised independently. Without preserving the clustering, the distribution of MA values would result in increased ALE values, and result in a more conservative method. \n   The MA values (red overlay) show the clustering of foci reported within a single experiment; 15 clusters and 71 foci.  \nA scatter plot showing the distribution of (non-zero only) MA values for this experiment depicts: the original MA distribution (circle marker), the MA distribution on randomisation of the clusters (- marker) with error bars (standard deviation), and the distribution after independent randomisation of the foci (triangle marker). The randomisation of the clusters preserves, on average, the observed distribution as required. The distribution of the MA values on randomising the foci independently has a higher frequency of low MA values as expected. \n  \n\n### Random experiments \n  \n reports the number of significant clusters on analysing the randomised foci experiments using LocalALE and GingerALE. No significant clusters were reported in any of the 1000 experiments using FCDR, while BH-FDR and FDR found significant clusters in only a small percentage of experiments. GingerALE, on the other hand, reports a median of 3 significant clusters per experiment, with an average size of 575 mm  (72 voxels). \n   The random foci experiment, involving randomisations of the face perception experiment.  \nShown are the numbers of clusters found for each random experiment. This experiment examines the frequency of false cluster discovery in the absence significant clustering. \n  \n\n### Face perception \n  \n shows the results of the overlap measure, used for diagnostic purposes. While many of the studies overlap with values close to 1, there are outliers. Platek \u201906   has results recorded as MNI coordintates in the brainmap database, but they are actually Talairach coordinates; on correcting this, the overlap increased from 0.80 to 0.94. Braver \u201801   was designed to study working and long term memory tasks only in the prefrontal cortex; inclusion of this study is possibly inappropriate since it does not consider the whole brain, unlike the other studies in the analysis. Other apparent outliers are most likely due to experimental design subtlety, or because the overlap estimate is noisy where few foci are reported. \n   Overlap measures for face perception experiment (a), and the pain stimulus experiment (b).    \n shows the clusters found using FDR and FCDR control (LocalALE) and FDR control (GingerALE) at a level of 0.05; the Talairach regions involved are reported in  . There is little difference using the WB or the GM mask in LocalALE. LocalALE controlled by FDR produced extra clusters that were not found by GingerALE, and vice-versa. These discrepant clusters were either quite small (GingerALE) or only just significant and involving few experiments (LocalALE). FCDR control resulted in fewest clusters, and did not find any of the discrepant clusters. \n   ALE images and statistically significant clusters found on meta-analysis of the face perception data using LocalALE (red) and GingerALE (blue).  \nIn column 1 the left images are ALE values computed using LocalALE, and the right ALE values from GingerALE.

FCDR controlled the false clusters best here. \n   Number of false clusters arising from randomisation of the non-significant foci only in the pain perception data; foci involved in statistically significant clusters found by LocalALE (FCDR) are not randomised.  \nThis experiment examines the frequency of false cluster discovery in the presence of known significant clustering. \n  \n\n### Thermal Pain Stimulus Data \n  \n shows the results of the overlap measure, used for diagnostic purposes. While many of the studies overlap with values close to 1, there are outliers. Borsook et al. (overlap score 0.53) used MNI space for analysis, but coordinates were subsequently adjusted to an MRI atlas of the human cerebellum. Remy et al. (overlap score 0.61) performed an experiment to study how pain modulates brain activity during the performance of a semantic cognitive task; while the paper reports pain as a main effect, on closer scrutiny the experiment was never performed with painful stimulus in isolation of the cognitive task. Both of these studies were excluded from further analysis. \n\n shows the clusters found using FDR and FCDR control (LocalALE) and FDR control (GingerALE) at a level of 0.05; the Talairach regions involved are reported in  . There is extensive clustering with this dataset, and many anatomical structures involved ( ). From   it is clear there are distinct regions with high ALE values where the density of experiments reporting foci is high. Our new clustering algorithm is able to detect these regions, while GingerALE merges multiple clusters. Consequently the cluster report from LocalALE is most complete and informative. \n   ALE images and statistically significant clusters found on meta-analysis of the thermal pain stimulus data using LocalALE (red) and GingerALE (blue).  \nIn column 1 the left images are the ALE values computed using LocalALE, and the right ALE values from GingerALE. Column 2 shows results using FDR control, and column 3 FCDR control. In columns 2\u20134, the left images show the ALE computed using only significant foci, while the results of the respective clustering algorithms are shown on the right. \n     Studies included in the thermal pain stimulus meta-analysis.         Pain stimulus results; significant results from GingerALE compared to those in LocalALE.        \n shows how modifying the clustering algorithm such that it is independent of the ALE values at each focus modifies the clusters. Nevertheless, the FCDR algorithm has still given very similar results. This suggests that FCDR is quite robust to the specifics of the clustering scheme used. \n   Clusters obtained with the pain data using the clustering algorithm described in appendix S1 (left), and also using a simplified algorithm that ignores the ALE (right).  \nWhile the clustering is different, the significant regions are very similar. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe have developed a new algorithm for performing coordinate based meta-analysis of fMRI studies that have a particular task type in common. The results are clusters located within brain structures that are important to the task. We have tackled one of the major issues with previously reported CBMA methods: type 1 statistical error control. To achieve this it was necessary to develop a new clustering algorithm, which allows clusters to be counted appropriately. The clustering algorithm also produces more complete reports of the meta-analysis results. We have also detailed a diagnostic tool, which is essential to ensure the quality of the analysis. \n\nOur method borrows heavily from the ALE method, but instead of a Gaussian function describing the uncertainty in location for each foci, a truncated Gaussian is used. Nevertheless, the ALE values computed by LocalALE are almost identical to those produced by GingerALE (  &  ). This is important since the ALE is the test statistic used for meta-analysis. Instead of testing for significantly high ALE in each voxel, we test only at the foci. Consequently complete experiments can be generated under the null hypothesis, stored, and processed; a task that would be very computationally demanding for a voxel-wise analysis. Computational hypothesis testing is performed by randomising the foci and iterating to generate a null distribution of ALE values. The randomisation is required to preserve the distribution of MA values in the observed data. Our method of randomising is different to that employed in the ALE and MKDA methods, but does preserve the MA on average as required (see  ). Clusters of significant foci form the results, and our algorithm can detect structure within the ALE that is important for complete reporting; rather than detecting connected voxel clusters, which can result in cluster merging (see   and  ). Because we can efficiently store and process many realisations of the experimental data generated under the null, we can analyse the p-values and use them directly to control the type 1 statistical error. We can therefore control the FDR, despite tests not being independent. Most importantly we can count the number of clusters and control the directly relevant FCDR. \n\nWe have performed several experiments to compare results from LocalALE to the much used ALE algorithm   incorporated in GingerALE; keeping the processing options as close as possible. \n\nWe expected to see very few significant results from the randomised foci experiment; the numbers of false clusters found is depicted in  . For this data BH-FDR and FDR control resulted in false clusters in a small fraction of experiments, while FCDR found none in 1000 experiments. GingerALE produced a median of 3 clusters per experiment, with an average size of 72 voxels (575 mm ). This is considerably larger than the suggested 45 voxel threshold suggested in  . These results suggest that, in the absence of consistent study data, the rate of false clusters is controlled best using FCDR, and that the many tests involved in a voxel-wise analysis may lead to increased false positive findings. \n\nDiagnostic analysis ( ) highlighted the importance of data checking. In the face perception experiment, of those with outlying overlap scores one study was found to be recorded incorrectly in the BrainMap.org; MNI coordinates recorded instead of Talairach. Another study tested a working and long term memory hypothesis, utilising face images, that may not have been functionally relevant. The overlap score revealed two outlying studies in the pain data, and these were removed from further analysis; one transformed coordinates from MNI to a different coordinate system, and while the other reported pain as a main effect it was combined with a cognitive task. \n\nLocalALE produced similar results to GingerALE with the face perception data ( ). The use of a WB mask or GM mask made little overall difference to the results. There were several extra clusters declared significant by GingerALE but not LocalALE, and vice-versa using the FDR option in LocalALE ( ). All clusters found using FCDR were also found by FDR (LocalALE) and by GingerALE. Clusters found exclusively by GingerALE, were smaller than the average size found in the randomised foci experiment, and could be false positives. Those found significant by LocalALE but not GingerALE were only marginally significant at a FDR of 0.05, contained few experiments, and were not significant by FCDR; the use of FDR would in this case result in significant clusters even though a high proportion of those clusters are expected to be false. \n\nTo examine the control of false positive clusters in the presence of known true clusters, we generated randomised foci experiments from the face perception data, with the significant clusters found using FCDR preserved (foci involved in those clusters not randomised). For each of 1000 generated experiments we counted extra clusters beyond the original 9 (reported in  ) using LocalALE. We also counted extra clusters in 100 of these experiments with GingerALE. The face perception data was ideal since we could employ cluster level control in GingerALE, and because any extra clusters were easily identifiable amongst the 9 true clusters.   shows that FCDR performs best, as extra clusters are generated from the random foci in only 10% of the experiments. Contrast this with the results from GingerALE, which produced false clusters in over half of the experiments. \n\nWe tested our clustering algorithm by performing a meta-analysis of thermal pain stimulus in healthy volunteer subjects. Pain stimulus has been shown to produce extensive activation on fMRI.   shows the ALE image of significant foci, and the clusters resulting from the analyses. LocalALE has found many more clusters than GingerALE ( ). Looking at the ALE images in  , it is clear that there are distinct regions of high ALE, where the density of studies reporting foci is at a peak. Even though these regions merge, the magnitude of the ALE helps LocalALE to separate them into different clusters; along with the requirement that the foci must overlap to form clusters in LocalALE. By contrast GingerALE simply finds connected significant voxels, which in the pain analysis has merged, for example, left and right insula, and the left and right Thalamus, into just one cluster (see  ). \n\nClustering is clearly important for FCDR control, and it is essential for correct reporting of structures involved in the functional task. To test whether the results of FCDR were particularly sensitive to the details of the clustering scheme, we modified the algorithm such that it did not use the ALE to form clusters (see  ). While the clustering is quite different, the regions found to be significant by FCDR are very similar. This is likely because the clustering is modified both for the observed experiment and the null experiments. Therefore, the exact details of the algorithm used to detect clusters do not seem to substantially change the type 1 error control imposed by FCDR. \n\nTesting only at the foci might limit the ability of LocalALE to resolve the shape of the significant clusters compared to voxel-wise analyses performed by other methods, since the foci are (relatively) sparse compared to the voxels. However, our results show that clusters tend to form in the same anatomical structures and even share shape features with those generated by the ALE algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to estimate the p-values: the probability that the observed ALE is greater than, or equal to, the ALE values observed under the null hypothesis. To obtain converged estimates, many randomisations must be performed; the latest version of the ALE algorithm considers every possible randomisation, so the p-values are analytic and precise. We found that 10000 randomisations produced sufficiently converged p-values such that repeating the analysis, with different randomisations, did not change the results. A limitation of coordinate based meta-analysis in general is that it is unlikely to be able to reproduce exactly the results of pooled image based meta-analysis  ,  . To perform a meta-analysis closer to such schemes using the reported foci might require details, for example Z scores at the foci, that are not reported in a standard way. More importantly the null hypothesis, that the studies are not related by task\/stimulus, is not strictly reflected in the null used to perform the Monte Carlo simulations used in CBMA. Nevertheless, a vast amount of coordinate based data is readily accessible, and CBMA is currently the accepted way to analyse it quantitatively. \n\n### Conclusions \n  \nLocalALE tackles one of the major issues with the previously published CBMA algorithms, the multiple testing problem. As a direct consequence of our approach, we are able to control the intuitive False Cluster Discovery Rate, which relates directly to the results (clusters) of the meta-analysis; unlike schemes that control tests on voxels or foci. In comparison to the widely used ALE algorithm, LocalALE detects relatively few false positives. We demonstrated that checking the suitability of each study is essential, as mistakes are easily made with the data. We also detailed a clustering algorithm that provides a more complete report of significant results than the ALE algorithm. LocalALE is available to use freely as part of NeuROI ( ). \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3726528,"text_md5":"d4a8b4980d5fe1d73136efd08a676d54","field_positions":{"authors":[0,91],"journal":[92,100],"publication_year":[102,106],"title":[117,220],"keywords":[234,234],"abstract":[247,1604],"body":[1613,40093]},"batch":1,"pmid":23922941,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0070143","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3726528","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3726528"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3726528\">3726528<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3726528  Coordinate Based Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data; False Discovery Control and Diagnostics"}

In contrast, experimental hyperalgesia induced stronger activation in the bilateral insula, left cingulate and right frontal gyrus. \n\nActivation likelihood maps support a shared neural pain signature of cutaneous nociception in CP and controls. We also present a double dissociation between neural correlates of transient and persistent pain sensitisation with general increased activation intensity but unchanged pattern in experimental hyperalgesia and, by contrast, focally increased activation likelihood, but unchanged intensity, in CP when stimulated at the most painful body part. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChronic pain is a common public health concern. According to a report by  , pain accounts for 40% of primary care consultations. A survey of adult Europeans found that the prevalence of moderate or severe chronic pain was 19% ( ), of whom 21% were diagnosed with depression related to their pain and 65% reported sleep disturbance due to pain ( ). Severe chronic pain was also found to be associated with increased 10 year mortality ( ). In the absence of more effective pain treatment personal suffering and socio-economic burden are huge, with the total annual cost of pain in the US estimated to be between $560 and $635 billion ( ). This highlights the need for better understanding of the neural mechanisms underpinning the processing of chronic pain in order to begin addressing this issue. \n\nPresently there is no clear temporal definition of when persistent pain is considered to be \u2fffchronic\u2fff. However, there is consensus that chronic pain refers to pain persisting beyond its ecological alerting function, (i.e. when no benefit from healing can be assumed). As such chronic pain is considered a maladaptive state that is characterised not only by pain severity but also by a range of associated comorbidities including depression, distress and anxiety. A detailed taxonomy based upon symptom description and underlying etiology has been developed and recently updated by the International Association for the Study of Pain ( ). Several etiological factors are coded, and in general nociceptive pain is distinguished from neuropathic pain:   nociceptive pain   involves activation of nociceptors through actual or threatened non-neural tissue damage, whereas   neuropathic pain   is defined as \u2fffpain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system\u2fff ( ). \n\nThe pathophysiology of chronic pain states is not well understood but there is a body of neurobiological and neuroimaging evidence suggesting that neuroplasticity is associated with the development of persisting pain ( ,  ,  ,  ). In animal models, several mechanisms of pain sensitisation were identified and characterised with peripheral sensitisation via activation of C-fibers, sodium channel alteration after nerve injury and central cord sensitisation due to increased spinal transmitter release and hyperexcitability of dorsal horn neurons ( ). Modulation of stimulus-induced pain perception at the supraspinal level is highly complex with close interconnection of sensory, emotional and cognitive appraisal networks. Moreover, a key serotonergic descending facilitation pathway originates from the rostral brainstem and is believed to mediate fear and anxiety-related pain augmentation ( ). Increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) is well known in chronic pain patients (CP) resulting from a combination of peripheral and central sensitisation at the spinal cord level and supraspinal pain augmentation\/facilitation ( ). \n\nCentral sensitization can be modelled in healthy human controls through priming, e.g. with intradermal capsaicin (active ingredient in chili, a TRPV1 receptor agonist), which leads to cross-modality hyperalgesia and allodynia (pain from non-noxious stimuli). The underlying neurophysiology is well characterised, and thought to reflect transient heterosynaptic changes making experimental central sensitisation a sound mechanistic model to test efficacy of centrally acting analgesics ( ). By contrast, top-down facilitatory processes are less well understood and robust experimental human models are lacking. Nevertheless, depression and low mood are commonly associated with chronic pain, and are thought to contribute to central pain augmentation and severity. Several studies have found that induction of depressed mood or sadness in healthy subjects increases pain sensitivity and augments pain unpleasantness ( ,  ,  ). \n\nModern functional neuroimaging has proved instrumental in gaining a deeper understanding of pain processing and its main modulatory factors in healthy volunteers ( ,  ) and chronic pain conditions. In line with the multidimensional nature of pain perception, experimental pain induces activation in several cortical and subcortical regions including primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices, insula (INS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, brainstem and prefrontal and parietal association areas ( ). These structures, often referred to as the \u2fffpain matrix\u2fff ( ), do not constitute a network that is unique to pain; in fact there are striking similarities with activation patterns of innocuous sensory stimuli ( ). Consistent, but not pain specific, co-activation may relate to any of the aspects of the pain experience including saliency of stimuli ( ), emotional responses ( ) or action preparation ( ), all of which could be modulated by chronic pain ( ). Functional neuroimaging might therefore be ideally suited to studying the functional reorganisation of both nociceptive and pain modulatory pathways in chronic pain syndromes, and to relate putative plasticity changes to etiologic pain subtypes and underlying mechanisms such as central sensitisation and negative affect. \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown altered neural response to pain in CP compared to healthy controls (HC), for example ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). However, there is some inconsistency between studies. Systematic reviews offer one method of exploring which of the reported altered neural responses are consistently observed, for example more frequent prefrontal, and less frequent ACC, S1, S2 and INS activation was noted in CP ( ,  ). Recently coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) has become a popular alternative. CBMA analyses the results from related studies and performs statistical inference on them. Probably the most commonly used method computes an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) using the reported coordinates to identify and locate brain structures that are activated consistently across studies or differently between conditions\/groups. In this way CBMA can mitigate low power and bias present in individual fMRI studies ( ,  ). Several CBMAs of pain have been performed ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). While some focused on general and modality-specific pain-induced changes in brain activity ( ,  ,  ) others have studied the role of specific structures ( ) or context-dependent effects ( ,  ). CBMA has also been used to compare abnormal and altered pain states in CP or experimental hyperalgesia ( ,  ). Allodynia\/hyperalgesia in chronic neuropathic and fibromyalgia patients was associated with increased activation likelihood in the left S2, ACC and right caudal anterior insula compared to experimental pain in HC ( ) while neuropathic pain decreased activation likelihood in most pain processing areas including S1, anterior and posterior insula and ACC compared to experimental hyperalgesia in HC ( ). There are, however, several methodological limitations of previous CBMA studies of pain. We have previously shown that the ALE methods are prone to false positive results ( ,  ), and a new version of the software implementation (GingerALE, version 2.3.3) has been released to fix this. We have also shown that the false positive rate can increase with increasing study numbers ( ); the current ALE algorithm does not correct for this. Furthermore, group comparisons make assumptions about the ALE that do not strictly hold ( ,  ), or lack appropriate correction for the many statistical tests performed ( ). A further limitation is the uncontrolled heterogeneity between studies, often mixing functional neuroimaging methods (known to vary in sensitivity) or mixing a range of nociceptive receptor systems (superficial, deep and visceral). \n\nTo better understand the commonalities of altered pain processing in CP and any specific modulation related to its subtypes, and importantly to compare activation patterns in CP with experimental models of putative underlying mechanisms of pain sensitisation (hyperalgesia and low mood) in healthy controls, we undertook a CBMA on superficial pain fMRI studies and systematically addressed key experimental factors. We hypothesised that the neural response to experimental pain differs between CP and HC reflecting functional reorganisation, and that such changes can be partially modelled by experimental hyperalgesia or low mood in healthy controls. To overcome some of the limitations of previous pain CBMAs we employ a recently developed modified ALE based algorithm that reduces false positive results by using an intuitive type 1 error control scheme: the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR; similar to false discovery rate, but for clusters) control ( ). We employ the same control for the contrast meta-analysis (CMA) used to locate differences in functional activation foci due to pain stimulus between groups ( ). However, this test is sensitive only to strong local differences, so we also use an omnibus test that can detect subtle but distributed differences in the pattern when CMA is unrevealing ( ). This test has also been used to explore differences due to experimental factors, such as pain stimulus modality (thermal, mechanical and electrical) to assess heterogeneity introduced by such factors. This, plus careful, and conservative study selection was used to create, as far as possible, homogeneous experimental groups. To this end, we limit the CBMA to fMRI studies and to cutaneous noxious stimuli thus eliminating unwanted heterogeneity from different imaging modalities and different nociceptive systems (superficial vs. deep and visceral). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study inclusion and data selection \n  \nThe literature search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting meta-analyses and systematic reviews ( ). Functional MRI studies of experimental cutaneous pain were searched both through standard literature databases (PubMed and Web of Knowledge) and from existing fMRI data repository NeuroSynth (neurosynth.org). NeuroSynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of fMRI data extracted from published articles ( ). We used the keywords (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff or \u2ffflow mood\u2fff or \u2fffemotion\u2fff). In order to capture as many papers as possible, including studies on CP, additional searches have been performed using the strings (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff)AND (\u2ffflow mood\u2fff or \u2fffemotion\u2fff), and (\u2fffMRI\u2fff or \u2fffmagnetic resonance imaging\u2fff) AND (\u2ffffunctional\u2fff or \u2fffbrain activation\u2fff or \u2fffneural activity\u2fff or \u2fffBOLD\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpain\u2fff or \u2fffnoxious\u2fff or \u2fffnociception\u2fff) AND (\u2fffpatients\u2fff or \u2fffneuropathic\u2fff or \u2fffchronic pain\u2fff or \u2fffhyperalgesia\u2fff or \u2fffallodynia\u2fff). For the search on NeuroSynth repository we used the key word \u2fffpain\u2fff. Last accession of e-sources: 15 February 2015. The references of retrieved articles were then assessed for additional studies that could be considered for inclusion; along with the relevant references from review articles and meta-analyses. Abstracts were reviewed to select those studies involving noxious pain stimuli that had been induced via cutaneous stimulation. Studies reporting only activations for spontaneous pain in patients were excluded. Only studies that reported whole-brain group analysis as coordinates in the standard Talairach & Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space were considered ( ,  ). Studies on HC with or without pain sensitisation were included. In cases where experimental pain was induced in addition to a cognitive manipulation task we only included the baseline coordinates of pain induction; if baseline coordinates were not given; the study was excluded from further analysis. \n\n\n### Data extraction and pre-processing \n  \nActivation coordinates were extracted from the papers manually and checked by three independent persons. Data extracted from each article were the authors\u2fff names, date of publication, study population, sample size, stimulus modality, anatomical site of stimulation, laterality of bodily stimulation, brain activation coordinates and their associated standardised space (Talairach or MNI). Differences in the standardised coordinate space were addressed by converting all reported coordinates into Talairach space ( ). We only included coordinates of activations since deactivations were reported by few studies, and the majority of studies did not comment on the presence or absence of deactivations. \n\nImportantly, we also extracted activation coordinates from studies of between group comparisons allowing us to perform coordinate based meta-analysis of contrasts (MAC). Since such data is generated under controlled experimental conditions, MAC provides a powerful way to explore spatially consistent differences in activation intensity between the groups. This analysis is complementary to the contrast meta-analysis, which explores differences in consistency of reported structures, performed on similar groups. \n\nMultiple studies reported in single papers can be strongly correlated. This would result in bias if these studies were considered independent ( ). To prevent this, the extracted coordinates were merged into a single study if the paper reported results differing only by experimental factors such as different stimulus intensities, different body site stimulated, or data split by analysis e.g. late\/early BOLD response. Studies using different subjects were not merged. \n\nDifferent studies reporting the same results also violate the assumption of independence. Instances of repeated coordinates were identified and removed to prevent bias. \n\n\n### Coordinate based meta-analysis \n  \nHere we use a recently developed algorithm (LocalALE), which is freely available from  . This algorithm utilizes the coordinates from fMRI studies to estimate where there is consistently reported activation across studies. It is based on the commonly used ALE algorithm ( ) that utilizes a Gaussian, with specified full width half max (FWHM), model for each coordinate to estimate the activation likelihood. When many studies report coordinates in a similar location, the activation likelihood is high; a threshold for statistical significance is determined by a permutation test. LocalALE has important advantages over the more commonly used ALE algorithm: (1) the false positive rate is reduced, and (2) by adjusting the FWHM, heterogeneity between experiments that have different numbers of studies is reduced ( ,  ). Anatomical placement of significant clusters was reported in Talairach space using an automatic labelling scheme incorporated within LocalALE ( ). \n\n\n### Contrast meta-analysis \n  \nContrast meta-analysis is used to compare the reported activation foci between two groups, and has been described previously ( ). The results are clusters of coordinates where the activation pattern differs significantly between the groups. The null hypothesis is that the two groups report the same activation pattern. Permutation of the group variable is performed to estimate a   p  -value for each coordinate. This differs from the previously published scheme, where a   p  -value was estimated for each voxel; our scheme reduces the number of statistical tests performed by several orders of magnitude, and employs FCDR, to control type 1 errors ( ). \n\n\n### An omnibus test of differences between two activation patterns \n  \nContrast meta-analysis is sensitive to localised spatial differences in activation pattern between two groups. These differences need to be highly significant to survive correction for the multiple statistical tests performed. Consequently CMA is not sensitive to more subtle diffuse differences between the groups. Therefore, we have devised an omnibus test of difference in activation pattern between two groups ( ). \n\nThe algorithm tests the combined   p  -values (sum, over coordinates, of the log   p  -values) generated by CMA using a method analogous to Fisher\u2fffs combined probability test; but without the assumption of independent, uniformly distributed,   p  -values. It achieves this by comparison with a null distribution generated from similarly combined   p  -values obtained by performing CMA on 1000 random permutations of the grouping variable. This test differs from CMA in that it requires not that single   p  -values be very small, but that the combined   p  -values be critical of the null hypothesis; this can occur when there is a diffuse pattern of subtle differences resulting in multiple small   p  -values, or a focal highly significant difference affecting just a few   p  -values. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \n#### Study and data quality control \n  \nThere is no consensus on minimum quality standards for, or how to quantify the quality of, functional MRI studies. Many fMRI studies are thought to be underpowered but there is no suitable formula based e.g. on number of subjects to determine a clear cut-off as the effect size for the chosen brain activation contrast will depend on the chosen activation and control task, respective presentation length and number of repeats in addition to technical factors such as field strength, sensitivity of head coil, acquisition protocol details and scanner-specific stability. Studies were thus considered eligible for inclusion when describing commonly used fMRI acquisition and analysis protocols. \n\nImportantly, we used the diagnostic procedure detailed in ( ) to check that studies appear commensurate in their respective groups. How commensurate each study is with all others was quantified by computing the mean activation likelihood across coordinates within the study, then comparing these to the distribution of mean activation likelihood values generated using an equal number of random coordinates; if the observed mean was in the high tail of this distribution, the study was considered commensurate. This test is sensitive to coordinate extraction errors and was used to pinpoint outlying studies to be scrutinised further and corrected as necessary. Further analysis was performed only after checking that the data are correct, and that the studies were included in the appropriate experimental group. \n\n\n#### Statistics \n  \nThe CBMA, and MAC, were performed using an FCDR of 0.05, so of the significant clusters identified at most 5% would be expected under the null hypothesis. Contrast meta-analysis is less sensitive and performed using an FCDR of 0.1. For primary analyses (HC vs. CP) trends towards significance are also noted. The omnibus test of differences was considered significant if   p  \u00a0\u2fe4\u00a00.05. \n\n\n#### Comparing activation pattern between groups \n  \nComparisons of study groups were performed using three types of analysis. Plotting the frequency with which the studies report activations in each Talairach structure visually highlights where the groups differ, and where they are similar; structures were determined as the nearest grey matter Talairach structure to each reported coordinate. Comparison of groups by CMA revealed clusters of coordinates in locations where the activation patterns differ statistically. If this was unrevealing, the omnibus test of differences was used to more sensitively detect any differences, but without revealing where those differences are. \n\n\n\n### Experimental factors affecting the neural pain response pattern \n  \nTo maximise statistical power experimental groups were created to contain as many studies as possible. This involved merging subgroups differing by experimental factors that might affect the functional response. Such differences would be a source of heterogeneity. The omnibus test was used here to explore such sources of heterogeneity. \n\nIt has been suggested that the encoding of painful stimuli takes place primarily in the contralateral hemisphere to the stimulation site ( ). Mirroring the coordinates from left-sided body stimulation about the y-axis (multiplying the x coordinate by \u2fff1) would then maintain homogeneity across all studies, as long as the hemispheric lateralization is of minor importance in pain processing. Such mirroring has been used in a previous CBMA of pain ( ), but has recently been challenged ( ). We compared subgroups of HC, where the grouping was right sided stimulation (subgroup RIGHT ,  ) and left sided stimulation (subgroup LEFT ,  ). The analysis was performed twice, once with original coordinates, and once with the coordinates mirrored in the left sided stimulus group. The results were used to determine whether mirroring of coordinates was performed throughout all subsequent experiments.   \nStudy groups included in the CBMA (in grey: main groups; in white: sub-groups). \n  Table 1   \n\nSubgroups of HC studies by modality (electrical, mechanical, and thermal) were formed (subgroups MECH , THERM , ELEC ;  ). HC studies were also grouped by baseline stimulus: \u2fffpain versus (vs.) innocuous stimuli\u2fff and \u2fffpain vs. rest\u2fff (subgroups INNOC  and REST ;  ), and by \u2fffcued\u2fff and \u2fffnon-cued\u2fff stimulation (subgroups CUED  and NCUED ;  ). Relevant subgroups were compared. \n\nPain sensitisation in CP may be affected by site and type (noxious or allodynic) of stimulus. In the CP group, half of the studies applied a stimulus at the most painful clinical site (CS) of the chronic pain (CS  subgroup;  ), while half used other bodily sites (OS) stimulation (OS  subgroup;  ); because all fibromyalgia (FM) studies included nociceptive stimulation remotely from any area reported by participants as being chronically painful (finger\/thumb stimulation\u2fff6 studies; hand stimulation\u2fff2 studies), we included the eight FM studies in the OS  subgroup. To assess the influence of FM studies on the results, comparison between CS and OS was also performed excluding FM from the OS group (using the omnibus test). Around one quarter of the CP studies used non-noxious stimuli at the allodynic site (ALDN  subgroup;  ) whilst the rest used noxious painful stimuli (NOX  subgroup;  ). These groups were compared by omnibus test. Moreover, we explored the effect of matching pain intensity between groups or conditions based on perceived pain intensity of stimulus intensity. We found that approximately half of the reported comparisons of CP vs. HC and hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia (MAC\u2fffs) used standardised stimulus intensity (stimulus-matched paradigm) with the other half of studies adapting stimulus intensity to standardise perceived pain intensity (pain percept-matched paradigm). Due to the small sample sizes and potential inhomogeneity between these experiments, they were compared for differences using the omnibus test. \n\n\n### Neural pain response pattern in CP and HC \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis was used to find clusters of coordinates due to painful stimuli in HC and CP groups. The nearest Talairach structure to the centre of these clusters is reported, and considered to be of functional relevance to pain processing. The frequency with which each Talairach structure was reported was evaluated. \n\n\n### Differences in the pain response pattern between CP and HC \n  \nThe neural signature of pain in CP and HC subgroups were compared using CMA to explore differences in activation patterns, and using MAC to explore differences in activation intensity. It is expected that the likelihood of activation shows significant spatial differences, reflecting functional reorganisation as previously suggested ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). We furthermore expected MAC differences related to hyperalgesia in CP. \n\n#### Is functional reorganisation in CP limited to neuropathic pain? \n  \nCP studies were sub-grouped by etiology (neuropathic (NEUR ;  ), nociceptive musculo-skeletal (MSK ;  ), and fibromyalgia (FM ;  ). There are distinct neurophysiological differences between neuropathic and musculo-skeletal pain disorders with controversies regarding the classification of FM  ( ,  ,  ). Thus, there may be differences in the functional response to pain stimulation between these groups with the expectation that neuropathic pain is characterised by more prominent functional reorganisation. Relevant comparisons were made between these subgroups using CMA and the omnibus test of differences between groups. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by hyperalgesia in HC? \n  \nTo assess whether functional reorganisation in CP is related to peripheral and central sensitisation as putative mechanisms, we studied the activation pattern specific to experimental hyperalgesia in healthy controls as a model of pain sensitisation. To this end we studied the pattern of pain processing in HC after experimental induction of hyperalgesia (HYPER  subgroup;  ) in comparison with normalgesia by CBMA of the hyperalgesia group, and by CMA and MAC between hyperalgesia and normalgesia. The frequency of reporting brain structures activated in each group was also explored. We expected significantly increased likelihood and increased intensity of activation due to central sensitisation in hyperalgesia ( ). \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by low mood in HC? \n  \nTo assess whether functional reorganisation in CP can be modelled by emotional status during painful stimulation, we studied the activation pattern specific to low mood in healthy controls under painful stimulation. Due to incomplete study reporting, we were unable to perform CMA between normal and low mood. Instead, we performed MAC of studies comparing painful stimulation with or without concomitant low mood condition (LM  subgroup;  ). We expected to detect increase in activation intensity during the low mood condition in emotional circuits and structures contributing to central pain augmentation and chronification. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 3815 reported coordinates of activation foci were extracted from 178 papers reporting on 266 fMRI studies of cutaneous experimental pain in 3014 subjects: 180 studies involved HC (2278 subjects; median 12, range 4\u2fff61 per study), and 38 studies involved CP (506 subjects; median 12, range 5\u2fff83 per study) (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material for included studies and  ). Coordinates from experimental hyperalgesia in HC and CP (11 studies, 116 subjects; 3 studies, 26 subjects) and pain studies in HC involving low mood induction (5 studies, 114 subjects) were also extracted.   \nFlowchart of fMRI papers included in the analysis. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nThe studies were divided into modality and condition-specific sub datasets ( ). Relevant contrast data from 37 studies suitable for MAC were available for extraction from 34 papers ( ).   \nStudy groups included in the coordinate based meta-analysis of contrasts (MAC), consisting of coordinates from fMRI studies of between-group comparisons. \n  Table 2   \n\nChronic pain patient conditions included neuropathic pain syndromes (chronic regional pain syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a04, trigeminal neuralgia, n\u00a0=\u00a01; burning mouth disorder, n\u00a0=\u00a01; syringomyelia, n\u00a0=\u00a01; post-herpetic neuralgia, n\u00a0=\u00a02; peripheral neuropathy n\u00a0=\u00a03; headache, n\u00a0=\u00a03; vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a01); primary nociceptive musculo-skeletal disorders (low back pain, n\u00a0=\u00a06; osteoarthritis, n\u00a0=\u00a02) and fibromyalgia (FM, n\u00a0=\u00a08). We additionally subdivided CP studies according to the site of the nociceptive stimulation: at the most painful clinically affected site (CS ;  ), or at another body site (OS ;  ). \n\n### Experimental factors affecting the neural pain response pattern \n  \nSubgroups of HC studies using right sided pain stimuli (RIGHT ;  ) and left sided pain stimuli (LEFT ;  ) were compared using the omnibus test, with and without mirroring the coordinates in the latter group. The difference was significant when comparing the original coordinates (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.036), but much more so when comparison was done using mirrored coordinates from the left sided stimulus studies (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002) demonstrating highly significant lateralisation of neural pain processing that cannot be neglected. Consequently, all subsequent experiments used original coordinates only. \n\nThe three different modalities of pain stimulation (mechanical, electrical, thermal) showed largely overlapping brain activation patterns (data not shown). However, the omnibus test did suggest some differences (mechanical vs. thermal:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.02; mechanical vs. electrical:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.04; electrical vs. thermal:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.16). \n\nWe compared HC studies contrasting pain against rest (subgroup REST ;  ) to studies contrasting pain against innocuous sensory stimuli (subgroup INNOC ;  ). No differences were detected (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nWe also compared studies employing cued painful stimulation (subgroup CUED ,  ) to non-cued painful stimulation (subgroup NCUED ,  ). Again, no differences were observed (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.13). \n\nWe compared the CP subgroup in which nociceptive stimulus was applied to the site of maximal clinical pain (CS ) to the CP subgroup in which painful stimulus was applied remotely to that site (OS ). The OS  subgroup included all eight FM studies, as none used stimulation of most painful body sites. The stimulated body parts in the two subgroups were: upper limb (CS  5 studies, OS  13 studies), lower limb (CS  6 studies, OS  1 study), trunk (3 studies\u2fffall CS ), and head and face (3 studies in each group). The omnibus test suggested some difference in activation pattern between these groups (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.006). We also compared the CS  group with an OS  group that excluded FM (OS-FM ). The omnibus test still indicated a difference in activation patterns between these groups (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.03). \n\nThe design differences in matching CP and controls for pain intensity were unlikely to have masked true group differences as a comparison by omnibus test of perception versus stimulus intensity matched studies revealed no difference (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.96). The same was found for hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia contrasts revealing no significantly difference when comparing perception and stimulus matched studies using the omnibus test (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.6). \n\nWe compared the CP subgroup employing allodynic pain stimulus to the subgroup employing noxious stimuli; allodynic (subgroup ALDN ;  ) vs. noxious (subgroup NOX ;  ). However, we detected no significant differences in the activation likelihood by omnibus test (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.46). \n\nAiming for large groups to increase power, subsequent experiments included studies using electrical, thermal, and mechanical modality types, rest and innocuous contrast conditions, cued and non-cued painful stimulus, and perception and stimulus intensity matched studies. However, the differences by pain stimulation modality, and by site of stimulation in the CP group, may be a source of heterogeneity. \n\n\n### The neural pain response pattern in chronic pain patients and in healthy controls \n  \nThe CBMA of nociceptive brain activation in the HC group revealed all \u2fffpain-matrix\u2fff processing areas (thalamus, INS, cingulate, PFC, S1, S2, parahippocampal gyrus, brainstem nuclei, basal ganglia,  a, Table S2.1). No single structure is reported by all studies. Right and left posterior insula (BA13) were the most consistent, each being reported in around 66% of studies. Other structures of the pain matrix were also among the most frequently reported. The bilateral BA40 (inferior parietal, S2) and left ACC (BA24) were reported in at least 1\/3 studies. Ranked frequencies of the most often reported structures are given (blue in  ). Interestingly amygdala activation is reported in less than 5% of experiments.   \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of neural response to cutaneous painful stimulation showing significant activation likelihood maps [pain activation] for healthy controls (a, blue), chronic pain cohorts (b, red) and hyperalgesia (c, green). \n  Fig. 2   \n\nThe CBMA of CP studies revealed clusters of activation in 15 structures: bilateral thalamus, bilateral INS, left S2, left dorsal ACC (BA32), bilateral precentral (BA6&BA44) and postcentral gyri (BA40), right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral basal ganglia and left anterior cerebellum ( b, Table S2.2). \n\nThe frequency plot ( , red) depicts the most often reported activation sites in CP: the right posterior insula (BA13) was the most frequently reported (63% of all CP studies) followed by the left BA13 and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (S2; BA40) in 37\u2fff50% of all studies. Bilateral putamen was reported by 34% of all CP studies.   \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of significant aggregated contrasts between condition [pain activation during hyperalgesia\u00a0>\u00a0normalgesia] (MAC, a, green) and significant difference of activation likelihood maps between stimulation sites [most painful clinically affected (CS)\u00a0>\u00a0other site (OS)] (CMA b, red (CS\u00a0>\u00a0OS), blue (OS\u00a0>\u00a0CS)). \n  Fig. 3     \nFrequency of reported structures in HC (blue) and CP (red) groups. Structures reported at least by 10% of the studies in HC group are displayed (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.). \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n### Does the neural pain response pattern differ between CP and HC? \n  \nCBMA in both HC and CP groups revealed similar clusters. No significant spatial differences in the activation pattern were found by CMA. However, there was a trend towards a significant difference just beyond the FCDR threshold (CP\u00a0>\u00a0HC, FCDR\u00a0=\u00a00.13) in the left supramarginal gyrus (BA40). A comparison using the omnibus test suggested subtle global differences reaching significance (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.048). \n\nWe qualitatively compared the structures reported as activated in both groups (HC and CP) using a frequency plot ( ), and noticed that both groups reported activated structures with relatively similar frequencies. \n\nWhile no statistically significant spatial differences in activation patterns were detected, this does not rule out the possibility that there are consistent spatial activation intensity differences. Therefore, MAC of reported comparisons of CP and HC (CP activation\u00a0>HC activation, subgroup CP_HC ;  ) was performed, which did not reveal any significant clusters of activation intensity difference. In all but two of the included studies, the painful stimulation was applied to another part of the body that was remote from the site of clinical pain in the CP subjects. An additional MAC of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia condition within CP subjects (HYPER_CP ) was also non-significant but only included three studies. \n\nDue to the potential inhomogeneity introduced by the different pain stimulus modalities, we also compared HC and CP subgroups including only studies of mechanical pain stimulation (subgroups MECH  and MECH ;  ); this resulted in the largest possible (28 vs. 22 studies respectively) modality specific subgroup analyses. No significant differences were found by either CMA below an FCDR of 0.1, and the omnibus test of difference was not significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.79). \n\nIn line with our hypothesis of higher personal relevance of pain stimulation of the most painful clinically affected body part we compared the CS  and OS  subgroups. The CMA CS  vs. OS  revealed four clusters of more likely activation in the CS  group (left putamen; right posterior INS, right mid-INS and left middle frontal gyrus,  b), and one cluster of more likely activation in the OS  group (precentral gyrus,  b, Tables 2.3\u2fff2.5). The frequency plots of reported structures in the two CP sub-groups, and HC, are displayed in Fig. S1. Left putamen was reported by 50% of the CS  studies, 19% of the OS  studies and 28% of the HC studies. \n\n#### Is functional reorganisation in CP limited to neuropathic pain? \n  \nWe analysed by CBMA the neural signature of pain in neuropathic pain patients (subgroup NEUR ;  ), chronic conditions involving MSK pain (subgroup MSK ;  ), and FM (subgroup FM ;  ). The cerebral structures consistently activated in the three subgroups were not significantly different either by CMA or the omnibus test of difference (  p  \u00a0>\u00a00.05). Findings were also not significant when including FM in the neuropathic pain group. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by hyperalgesia in HC? \n  \nThe pain activation pattern in a model of peripheral and central sensitisation (experimental hyperalgesia in healthy controls, subgroup HYPER ,  ) is displayed in green in  c. It shows activations in left thalamus, bilateral INS, right dorsal ACC (BA32), right superior frontal gyrus and the left lentiform nucleus (Table S2.6). The frequency plots of reported structures activated by experimental hyperalgesia in HC are displayed in Fig. S2. Of note, left putamen was reported by 33% of HYPER  studies. \n\nThe CMA of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia in HC did not elicit significant local or diffuse differences (omnibus test:   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.7). \n\n\n#### MAC of hyperalgesia vs. normalgesia in HC \n  \nContrast data comparing experimental pain induced in the presence of hyperalgesia and experimental pain induced in normal condition (normalgesia) was available for extraction in eleven studies of which six used stimulus matched comparison (subgroup HYPER ,  ). MAC indeed revealed a multifocal effect of hyperalgesia on brain activation with significant clusters of increased activation in the dorsal ACC (BA32), bilateral INS (BA13), left insula (BA40), right IPL (S2, BA40), right middle frontal gyrus (BA9), and left striatum ( a, Table S2.7). The activation pattern is highly similar to the pain signature revealed by CBMA of the CP and HC groups ( a and b). These results suggest that hyperalgesia increases activation intensity in many of the known pain processing areas compared to normalgesia which may in part reflect the experimental design of stimulus intensity rather than perception matching in five studies. Nevertheless, when inspecting the paradigms of those studies contributing to significant clusters perception-based matching designs contributed to all clusters. \n\nIt should be noted however, that at least two of four studies (from the same centre) contributed to all of the significant clusters that possibly contain overlapping subject samples ( ,  ,  ,  ). As this could not be proved conclusively, no study was excluded. \n\n\n#### Can functional reorganisation in CP be modelled by low mood in HC? \n  \nMAC comparing experimental pain induced in the presence of low mood and experimental pain induced in the absence of low mood included data from only five studies (subgroup LM_HC ,  ). MAC did not detect regions of consistently increased or decreased activation in the presence of low mood. Activation foci for the low mood condition were only reported seperately in one study so no CBMA was possible. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies demonstrated remarkably similar patterns with no significant spatial differences in nociceptive processing across all conditions of pain stimulation in chronic pain compared to healthy controls in normalgesia as well as after induced hyperalgesia. The subgroup of studies applying painful stimuli to the most painful clinically affected body part in CP, however, revealed that activation was significantly more likely in the left putamen, right mid and posterior insula and left middle frontal gyrus than if nociceptive stimuli are applied elsewhere. In contrast, there were no local differences in likelihood of activation between experimental hyperalgesia and normalgesia but activation intensity was upregulated in many of the pain processing areas including left anterior medial striatum and bilateral insula. \n\nThe cutaneous pain fMRI response pattern was very similar in healthy controls and chronic pain patients, and no spatial difference was detected by contrast meta-analysis; a finding reflected in the similarity of the per-structure activation report frequencies for the two groups. This finding was unexpected as functional studies are commonly referenced to evidence nociceptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain. The lack of a consistent shift of the spatial representation of nociceptive processing in clinical pain patients vs. controls is in stark contrast to previous coordinate based meta-analyses ( ,  ) that, however, contradict each other. Lanz et al. reported significantly more likely activated S2, contralateral SMA and ipsilateral cerebellum in patients vs. controls, but less likely activation in S1, insula, ACC, PFC, thalamus and cerebellum. By contrast, Friebel reported stronger convergence of activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, right anterior insula and left ACC in patients and reduced activation likelihood in the left posterior, right anterior insula, right SMA and S2. These discrepancies can be explained by methodological differences: Lanz et al. used a null hypothesis that coordinates were randomly distributed ( ), while Friebel et al. used a more appropriate permutation of the grouping variable, but did not correct for multiple voxel-wise statistical tests. Another important limitation of previous pain CBMAs is lack of consideration for the correlation between coordinates reported by similar experiments using the same subjects; it is important that these coordinates are not treated as independent ( ). Indeed, when rerunning the CBMA without appropriate merging, eight clusters were detected comparing the CP and HC groups (data not shown). Therefore, previously reported group differences might be explained by lack of rigorous data merging as required for any meta-analysis, or by inadequate statistical methodology. \n\nRegardless of the appropriateness of statistical inferences made, CMA can only test for consistent differences in the pattern of reported activation between groups, and not for possible differences in activation intensity within shared activations. This can be addressed by aggregating reported activation foci detected by studies comparing groups, such as HC and CP. MAC of data from eighteen eligible studies did not reveal spatially consistent activation intensity differences between CP and healthy controls. Five pain fMRI studies comparing CP and HC failed to show significant results on direct comparison of the CP and HC groups. Furthermore, seven studies did not report the results of comparison between these groups. It is conceivable that this represents a publication bias as authors might have refrained from undertaking between group comparison due to expected low power or from reporting negative results, which either way would be in line with the negative MAC result. \n\nFailure to observe a consistent localised differential activation pattern across the studied populations and experimental designs does not exclude possible subtle widespread differences in activation pattern, or differences limited to specific patient subgroups or experimental settings; for example a systematic anterior shift of insular activation was reported for neuropathic patients ( ). Also, a recent detailed analysis demonstrated plasticity of the somatosensory system only in patients with chronic neuropathic pain ( ). Therefore, we additionally tested for global differences in the activation pattern between groups, and subgroups, using a more sensitive omnibus test ( ). This suggested a subtle global differences across activation patterns between the HC and CP (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.048). Importantly, functional reorganisation is likely moderated by pain etiology and phenotype, but the neuropathic and nociceptive subgroups were not detectably different from the HC group. Furthermore, there is some uncertainty how to classify patients with fibromyalgia (FM), and individual pain fMRI studies suggested hyperactivation of the insula which might reflect the postulated multisensory sensation syndrome in FM ( ). However, no differences between the subgroup of eight pain fMRI studies in FM and healthy controls were detected. \n\nThe experimental conditions are known to affect the pattern and intensity of fMRI response in healthy controls, so it is unclear how to best study brain plasticity in CP. Intuitively, eliciting clinical pain would be most relevant. However, as this is not always possible, we subgrouped CP studies according to whether the stimulus was applied on the clinically affected body part or remotely. When exposed to experimental painful stimulation of their most painful clinically affected body part, CP exhibited consistently higher likelihood of activation in the left putamen, left middle frontal gyrus, right posterior and mid INS. Post hoc analysis comparing activation patterns on clinical site stimulation to healthy controls revealed the two most significant stuctures were the left putamen and right INS, but these were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This is also suggested by the frequency plots showing putaminal activation in 28% of HC pain fMRI studies in contrast to 50% in CP exposed to nociception of the affected body part. We did not identify any other experimental factor (pain modality, cued vs. non cued, control condition) predicting the increased likelihood of putaminal activation. \n\nThe putamen is not considered part of the common neural signature of pain, with its main function being motor and implicit learning. Recently, however, a compelling case was made that the putamen may play a key role in co-ordinating nociceptive, sensory and cognitive-emotional pain processing ( ). Such a role is foremost supported by the anatomical connectedness of the putamen; probabilistic tractography revealed that the putamen is not only interconnected with sensori-motor circuits but also nociceptive and attention areas including ACC, INS and thalamus, emotional and memory networks including the amygdala, hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN)\/ventral tegmental area (VTA) ( ). SN and VTA both receive direct afferent nociceptive information from the spinal cord via the parabrachial nucleus in the midbrain, and activate the putamen during pain ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Importantly, the putamen can shape activity in large areas of cortex via differentially modulating the levels of inhibition into the thalamus in both animals and humans ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Mechanistic support also comes from a study in patients with putamenal lesions who demonstrated decreased pain sensitivity and widespread decreases in pain-related brain activation ( ). \n\nWe propose that the putamen plays a specific role in the maladaptive state of chronic pain related to affective learning. Several functional neuroimaging studies showed putaminal\/striatal activation in aversive learning ( ), disgust ( ), and hate ( ). Putamen activation was also directly linked to learning of pain-related fear ( ), with co-activation during early acquisition even in a rapid conditioned aversive learning paradigm using visceral pain as an unconditioned stimulus ( ). A link of the observed increased putaminal activation in CP with aversive affective learning is also in line with recently reported coordinate based meta-analysis of fMRI studies on emotion regulation finding increased striatal activation during emotional upregulation, which was interpreted to be reflective of its role in affective learning and the initial stages of action preparation ( ). Of note, most of the studies included in Frank et al. involve unpleasant stimuli, ( ). The observed modified putaminal response to pain stimulation of clinically affected body parts might thus reflect implicit aversive learning and consecutive enhanced affective regulation ( ). \n\nIntriguingly, putamen activation is an emerging hallmark of spontaneous pain processing in clinical pain as assessed by PET ( ) and arterial spin labelling ( ,  ,  ). These studies consistently reported increased blood flow and metabolism indexing neural activity in the left putamen in patients with on-going pain. Further supporting a key role for the putamen in pain augmentation comes from the observation of high incidence of pain in Parkinson\u2fffs characterised by putaminal dopaminergic denervation ( ), putaminal dopaminergic deficit in chronic pain patients ( ), and an inverse link between D2 receptors and dopamine availability and pain sensitivity in healthy controls ( ). Taken together with our findings this provides evidence for a previously unrecognised key role of the putamen in maladaptive neuroplasticity in the chronic pain state, which is likely to reflect emotional upregulation. Our finding of modified putamen activity linked to pain stimulation of the affected body part highlights that functional reorganisation in CP is site-sepecific. This could possibly result from local and regional sensitisation as well as conditional augmentation which is dependent upon it\u2fffs contextual relevance in line with implicit aversive learning. \n\nNoxious stimulation at the most painful clinically affected site in CP also induced more right posterior INS activation, which likely reflects CP induced hyperalgesia. In fact, the posterior insula is the most consistently reported brain activation site across all pain conditions and groups (frequency plots). This is in line with direct stimulation experiments showing that pain perception can only be elicited from the posterior insula ( ). Our result concords with recent evidence for a close correlation of pain perception with regional blood flow increase in the posterior insula ( ). Posterior INS also encodes intensity of a pain stimulus ( ) and is hence a plausible neural correlate of hyperalgesia. Peripheral and central sensitisation are increasingly recognised not only in neuropathic but also primary nociceptive chronic pain syndromes such as OA, leading to local and, to a lesser extent, remote hyperalgesia evidenced by reduced pain thresholds ( ). Given the core role of the posterior insula for pain perception, increased activation likely reflects hyperalgesia in chronic pain. Moreover, INS activation correlates with unpleasantesness of thermal hyperalgesia ( ) and is involved in modulation of the affective aspect of sensory perception by pain expectation ( ). Multiple functional associations have been reported for the middle frontal gyrus (BA9), including attention to negative emotional stimuli ( ). Interstingly, BA9 was also significantly more likely to be activated in clinical site vs. other site pain stimulation. \n\nA main aim of our meta-analysis was to investigate the nature of maladaptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain using a mechanistically based approach. The most popular model of pain sensitisation is experimentally induced transient hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers using capsaicin to reduce pain thresholds locally and remotely for homo- and heteromodal nociception thus modelling both peripheral and central sensitisation ( ). Should the observed increased likelihood of putaminal, middle frontal and mid and posterior INS activation in CP stimulated at the clinical site be caused by sensitisation alone, we would expect a similar difference to emerge from experimental hyperalgesia. In contrast, we found no differences between the aggregate response pattern to cutaneous noxious stimuli in experimental hyperalgesic vs. normalgesic. The smallest   p   value for the left putamen from this CMA (HYPER  vs HC) was 0.014, which is far above the threshold for significance after correction for multiple comparisons. This is not surprising, as the frequency plots show left putamen and right INS being reported with close frequencies by studies in both groups: 33% HYPER  and 28% in the HC group (left putamen); 77% HYPER  and 66% in the HC (right INS). This is again in clear contradiction with previous CMA findings that described a higher activation likelihood of bilateral S2 and prefrontal cortex, right ACC, left basal ganglia and cerebellum in hyperalgesia\/allodynia as well as reduced activation likelihood of the right insula, left ACC and prefrontal cortex, bilateral thalamus and bilateral basal ganglia ( ). As discussed above the fundamental differences in statistical inference explain the stark differences. \n\nIntriguingly, while we found no spatial differences in the activation likelihood pattern using CMA, using MAC we found several clusters of consistently increased activation intensity as a neural correlate of central sensitisation. The observed hyperactivity pattern in experimental hyperalgesia includes many pain processing areas with the mid-left ACC, bilateral insula, right S2, left striatum in addition to the right middle frontal gyrus. The most parsimonous explanation would thus be that the brain correlate of central sensitisation is a generalised upregulation of pain processing. This in turn would be in line with the behavioral hyperalgesia and mechanistically with increased nociceptive signalling ( ). The pattern also closely resembles regions identified to encode perceived pain intensity ( ) including the salience network (anterior INS and ACC). Increased salience network activation furthermore accords well with the real world experience of heightened arousal and cognitive attention in hyperalgesia\/allodynia induced by sunburn. The lack of altered activation likelihood, however, suggests that   transient   central sensitisation is insufficient to induce functional brain reorganisation. Moreover, the pattern of the neural pain response modulated by experimental cutaneous hyperalgesia is largely dissociated from that in CS  demonstrating that experimental hyperalgesia does not mimic neuroplasticity in clinical pain. Importantly, these dissociations cast doubt on the validity of experimental hyperalgesia as model for assessing analgesics for chronic pain conditions ( ). \n\nWhen comparing the hyperalgesia pattern identified using MAC with the altered activation likelihood pattern in CS  only remote similarities can be noted. From 7 clusters in the hyperalgesia-normalgesia contrast, only two clusters showed proximity to the CS  pattern: the left lentiform nucleus cluster in hyperalgesia maps adjacent (more medial, anterior and inferiorly) to the left putamen maximum in CS ; and secondly the right mid insula (BA13) in hyperalgesia locates anteriorly to the right mid insular cluster of increased activation likelihood in CS . Despite the predominant dissociation of experimental hyperalgesia and CS , the proximity of some activation foci point to possible partially shared mechanisms. Against the background of known pain sensitisation in both conditions, the different type of pain activation augmentation (increased activation intensity vs. likelihood) in adjacent regions might reflect the dynamics of transient to chronic central sensitisation. It is intriguing to speculate that regional hyperactivation as demonstrated by a model of central sensitisation over time may result in functional reorganisation indexed as increased activation likelihood in chronic pain. \n\nThe aggregate cutaneous pain response pattern identified from this coordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies is confirmatory of previous meta-analysis in healthy subjects reflecting the expected multidimensional neural networks contributing to the subjective pain experience. The consistently activated brain regions represent the so called neural signature of pain ( ), formerly referred to as \u2fffpain matrix\u2fff ( ), and include the sensory nociceptive loop (brainstem, S1, S2, posterior insula, thalami), the salience network (ACC, anterior insula), prefrontal cortex and striatum. None of these brain activations are specific for pain ( ), but the fine grained neural activation pattern identified through machine learning was shown to predict physical pain with 94% accuracy, and even analysis of activation patterns within single regions (dorsal ACC, anterior INS, S2 and post INS) achieved on average better than 75% sensitivity and specificity ( ). This consistent neural signature of pain does, however, not translate into the same consistency of identified activation foci across pain fMRI studies included in our analysis. Our frequency plot analysis that is directly comparable to systematic reviews performed before advent of coordinate based spatial MA confirms that the posterior insula (right and left) is the most consistently reported structure. However, it is noteworthy that more than 1 in 3 fMRI pain studies do not report activation of the posterior insula. This highlights a remarkable sensitivity issue of current pain fMRI studies rather than a genuine variability of pain processing as functional imaging studies are known for very low statistical power ( ). \n\nThe main limitations of this coordinate based meta-analysis are the limited number, and heterogeneity, of chronic pain fMRI studies as well as inconsistent reporting. With 266 studies included this is one of the largest and arguably most rigorous pain fMRI CBMA to date in healthy volunteers but numbers in chronic pain patients and hyperalgesic conditions are lower. In particular, there were only few cutaneous pain fMRI studies in low mood, which reported contrasts only, precluding the possibility of mood-related CMA and preventing firm interpretation of the negative results of the low vs. normal mood meta-analysis of contrasts. Importantly, there is substantial variation across studies in which criteria were applied to report \u2fffpeak activation\u2fff depending on the analysis methods used, in particular the thresholds used which varied between   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, FDR and FWE correction. This reflects the lack of consensus on standards, use of different software packages and versions and incomplete reporting in the field of functional neuroimaging (reviewed by  ). Also, only one in five of the included studies reported coordinates for functional deactivation precluding a meta-analysis of this important feature of nociceptive response. This and the lack of included CBF studies of spontaneous pain prevent a direct comparison with the meta-analysis reported by ( ), which was largely based on PET studies. We chose to limit our meta-analysis to fMRI as strong method dependent differences were reported previously ( ). \n\nAnother important limitation is the incomplete reporting of pain intensity which results in the inability to control for perceived pain intensity between subgroups. Nevertheless, in those studies where the group comparisons were directly reported and extracted (for the MAC analyses) we found a balanced count of studies using percept or stimulus intensity matched paradigms. As these numbers were low, additional subgroup analyses were not carried out, Thus we cannot disentangle the effects of transient central sensitisation from experimentally designed differences in pain intensity encoding. We did not extract pain anticipatory brain activity, which might reveal additional CP specific alterations as there were so few studies reporting on this in CP cohorts. \n\nWe limited this coordinate based meta-analysis to the more commonly used cutaneous pain stimuli, and can thus not generalise our findings to deep pain stimulation of muscle or viscera. Hence we also did not include muscle or visceral experimental hyperalgesia, which conceivably might heighten pain unpleasantness and thus might more closely match the neural signature of chronic pain. \n\nIn general, we found that only a minority of CP studies and not all experimental hyperalgesia studies reported results (co-ordinates) from between condition\/group comparisons. This is highly recommended for future pain fMRI studies as MAC is a powerful alternative to CMA for several reasons: (i) the direct between group or condition comparison is an effective way to controlling for unwanted heterogeneity resulting from technical and experimental specificities between studies, (ii) the advantages of careful matching of case control studies are only preserved in MAC but not CMA, and (iii) MAC is sensitive to differences in activation strength. Current drives for publicly available neuroimaging repositories will have the additional advantage for large pooled image based analysis with the potential of further advances over CBMA ( ) provided effective and validated means for controlling study-and scanner specific bias become available. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCoordinate based meta-analysis of superficial pain fMRI studies using statistically rigorous methodology revealed remarkably similar activation patterns in healthy controls during normalgesia and hyperalgesia and chronic pain patients. However, we describe a consistent pattern of hyperactivation in experimental hyperalgesia as model of transient central sensitisation. Also, we identified increased likelihood of left putaminal, right middle frontal gyrus and mid\/posterior insular activation when stimulating the clinically affected site in CP, which we interpret to reflect neuroplasticity linked to chronic sensitisation augmented by aversive contextual learning. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5554296,"text_md5":"110481105d6d48d5d7bb5c34bdb1d8aa","field_positions":{"authors":[0,104],"journal":[105,126],"publication_year":[128,132],"title":[143,297],"keywords":[311,395],"abstract":[408,2061],"body":[2070,63166]},"batch":1,"pmid":27168346,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2016.04.001","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5554296","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5554296"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5554296\">5554296<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5554296  Functional reorganisation in chronic pain and neural correlates of pain sensitisation: A coordinate based meta-analysis of 266 cutaneous pain fMRI studies"}

As meta-analytical findings help building cumulative knowledge and guide future research, not only the quality of such analyses but also the way conclusions are drawn is extremely important. Like classical meta-analyses, coordinate-based meta-analyses can be subject to different forms of publication bias which may impact results and invalidate findings. The file drawer problem refers to the problem where studies fail to get published because they do not obtain anticipated results (e.g. due to lack of statistical significance). To enable assessing the stability of meta-analytical results and determine their robustness against the potential presence of the file drawer problem, we present an algorithm to determine the number of noise studies that can be added to an existing ALE fMRI meta-analysis before spatial convergence of reported activation peaks over studies in specific regions is no longer statistically significant. While methods to gain insight into the validity and limitations of results exist for other coordinate-based meta-analysis toolboxes, such as Galbraith plots for Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) and funnel plots and egger tests for seed-based d mapping, this procedure is the first to assess robustness against potential publication bias for the ALE algorithm. The method assists in interpreting meta-analytical results with the appropriate caution by looking how stable results remain in the presence of unreported information that may differ systematically from the information that is included. At the same time, the procedure provides further insight into the number of studies that drive the meta-analytical results. We illustrate the procedure through an example and test the effect of several parameters through extensive simulations. Code to generate noise studies is made freely available which enables users to easily use the algorithm when interpreting their results. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) continues to contribute greatly to the knowledge about the location of cognitive functions in the brain [ ]. Neuroimaging studies are valuable sources of information for functional organization of the brain but often face substantial challenges. A huge variety in employed experimental conditions and analytical methods exist, possibly leading to inconsistencies across studies and paradigms. Several different implementations and task contrasts might be applied while exploring a certain paradigm, using different analysis toolboxes, pipelines and statistical thresholds. Furthermore, fMRI studies are relatively expensive which often limits the size of studies [ ] leading to low statistical power to detect true activation [ ]. Further progress in understanding human brain function will therefore also require integration of data across studies using meta-analyses, which can increase power to detect a true effect and allows to assess the replicability or consistency of activated regions across labs and tasks [ \u2013 ]. \n\nfMRI studies capture information about more than 100.000 voxels in the brain, however, the most prevailing trend to report results remains providing only the coordinates of statistically significant local maxima (called peaks or foci) [ ]. Several coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques have been developed to combine results of studies that employ this censored reporting of results. First Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) [ \u2013 ] was developed, which is most frequently used (see  ). Later on, Seed-based d Mapping [ ] and multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) [ ] arose. Other methods include model-based procedures [ \u2013 ] and parametric coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. \n\nALE and MKDA only use the location (xyz-coordinates) of local maxima reported by the individual studies and determine at which location the convergence of foci is larger than can be expected by chance. Seed-based d mapping additionally takes peak height into account and offers the possibility of entering entire t-maps into the meta-analysis. GingerALE [ \u2013 ] is a tool that implements the ALE algorithm and is accompanied by the BrainMap database [ \u2013 ], which provides an advantage for using ALE. The BrainMap database is a collection of over 3000 papers, containing information about e.g. experimental conditions, subjects and allows to extract peak locations. It is important to point out that peak locations extracted from this database can of course also be used as input for other algorithms, such as MKDA and seed-based d mapping. However, peaks from the BrainMap Database are not optimal for use with seed-based d mapping because peak height is not stored in the BrainMap Database, while seed-based d computes effect sizes based on peak height. \n   Number of publications per coordinate-based meta-analysis algorithm.  \nResult after a web of science search executed on June 1, 2018. On web of science search terms were ALE meta-analysis for the ALE-algorithm, MKDA meta-analysis for the MKDA algorithm and SDM meta-analysis for the seed-based d mapping algorithm. \n  \nMeta-analyses play an important role in aggregating research findings to form a comprehensive overview and to build cumulative knowledge. Such analyses guide further advancement of theory and research. It is therefore key to rigorously use meta-analytical techniques but researchers should also pay attention to an adequate interpretation of results [ ] in the light of possible pitfalls such as publication bias, which occurs when the results of published and unpublished studies differ significantly. \n\nRegardless of the area of research, statistically significant findings are more likely to get published than studies with non-significant results [ ] implying that the latter remain largely hidden. This is known as the file drawer problem and is a specific form of publication bias [ \u2013 ]. The file-drawer problem can affect the outcome of a meta-analysis by overestimating effects, as no contra-evidence is taken into account. Rosenthal proposed a measure that allows to assess the stability of meta-analytical results [ ]. The statistic that is calculated is the \u201cFail-Safe N\u201d which is the maximum number of studies with an effect of 0 that can be added before meta-analytical conclusions are altered. This was later adapted by Hsu [ ] to the maximum number of studies with nonsignificant findings that can be added to a meta-analysis before the conclusions no longer hold. When focusing on the file-drawer problem, it quantifies the number of null studies (i.e. studies without statistically significant results) that are needed to alter a meta-analytical result from statistically significant to statistically non-significant. The Fail-Safe N functions as a measure of robustness as it quantifies the number of studies that are needed to change results, with a low number being indicative for low robustness. In that sense, it can be used as an indication for how robust results are against publication bias. If the expected number or percentage of null studies that remain in the file drawer is known, it is possible to determine whether results remain valid if these null studies would be entered into the meta-analysis. The measure provides an addition to the interpretation of results because it helps in the assessment of the confidence that can be placed in them [ ] by showing how stable they remain in the presence of unreported information that may differ systematically from the information that is included. \n\nIn neuroimaging literature, it has been shown that there is an excess of positive findings in literature [ ,  ]. This stems from different potential sources. David et al. specifically mention selective outcome and analysis reporting bias, manipulation of parameters (such as lenient thresholding) and under-reporting of null results (file drawer) [ ]. In this paper, we focus on the latter and more specifically on the robustness of results in the potential presence of file drawer problem. While literature on publication bias in neuroimaging remains limited, evidence for its existence has been found [ ]. \n\nIn the current paper, we focus on the interpretation of meta-analytical results of ALE. We propose a measure for robustness against potential publication bias that is an adaptation of the classical Fail-Safe N. Through an algorithm for computing this measure for ALE meta-analyses, we aim to provide a means to evaluate the stability of results which provides insight into robustness should the file drawer problem be present. The techniques and results are specific to ALE but the basic principles are generalizable to be used with other methods as well. The general idea is to add studies that do not report activation foci in a target area to an existing meta-analysis to determine the amount of contra-evidence that is needed before spatial convergence of foci over studies in that area is no longer statistically significant. The studies with contra-evidence are called \u201cnoise studies\u201d as they contain foci that are randomly distributed throughout the brain (as opposed to foci that converge to particular regions). A more detailed explanation can be found in section 2.4. It should be noted that both the classical and adapted Fail-safe N measures are not intended to indicate whether publication bias is present or not. Despite this, we argue that the measure is a useful addition in reporting meta-analytical results while it is conceptually relatively easy to obtain. \n\nThe recent mass simulation paper of Eickhoff et al. provides users with clear and motivated guidelines for performing a meta-analysis with the ALE algorithm [ \u2013 ,  ]. These guidelines include employing cluster-level family-wise error correction for moderate effects and a set size of at least 20 studies. With the use of an adapted Fail-Safe N measure, we aim to complement these general guidelines by providing an added value to the interpretation of brain regions selected as statistically significant by the ALE algorithm. While a high number indicates results that remain stable even if many noise studies are in the file drawer, a number that is excessively high, exposes another potential problem. It may be the case that some studies in a meta-analysis have an extensive influence on final results. Researchers should therefore also consider the contribution of individual studies in reporting results. Hence, in this setting, the measure provides insight into robustness against publication bias as well as individual study contribution on final results. \n\nIn the next sections, we introduce and illustrate the algorithm to calculate the adapted Fail-Safe N for the ALE algorithm with an example meta-analysis and perform extensive simulations to test the influence of number of peaks, sample size and thresholding method on the outcome of the Fail-Safe N. Based on the algorithm outlined in the paper, we also provide a script that allows a researcher to generate noise studies based on the specific properties of their original meta-analysis, namely sample sizes and number of peaks of the individual studies. Researchers can use these noise studies to compute a Fail-Safe N adapted to their specific meta-analysis. \n\n\n## 2. Material and methods \n  \nIn this study, we propose a measure for robustness against potential publication bias for coordinate-based (CBMA) meta-analyses. We will focus explicitly on ALE-meta-analyses. In the remainder of the paper, we will refer to the measure of robustness as the Fail-Safe N (FSN) as it is inspired by (but not identical to) this measure that was introduced in classical meta-analysis literature. The original FSN [ ] represents the required number of findings with an effect of zero to change the conclusions of the meta-analysis under the assumption that these findings are still in the \u201cfile drawer\u201d. \n\nIn this section, we first briefly describe some general principles of coordinate-based meta-analyses and indicate which tools for assessing publication bias are already available. Then we briefly describe the ALE procedure in more detail before conceptualizing the FSN for use in an ALE meta-analysis. We refer interested readers to the appendix for a brief discussion of the original FSN for classical meta-analyses. While conceptually similar, its implementation within the context of CBMA meta-analyses, and ALE in particular, differs substantially from this original FSN. Lastly, we present an adaptive algorithm to obtain the FSN to restrict the computations that are needed. \n\n### 2.1 Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nPerforming a meta-analysis of fMRI studies poses an extra challenge as typically only locations of activated peaks are reported. Different algorithms have been developed to conduct a meta-analysis on peak locations and in this section, we will briefly explain the three most used, seed-based d mapping, the ALE algorithm and MKDA. \n\nSeed-based d mapping is most similar to classic meta-analysis as it computes a weighted average of effect sizes for each voxel. Effect sizes for every study are derived from peak t-statistics or thresholds employed in the individual studies. The ALE algorithm and MKDA are different from seed-based d mapping as they look at the spatial convergence of foci instead of peak height. These algorithms construct kernels of spatial uncertainty around reported peaks and look at the overlap between kernels to determine at which location spatial convergence is larger than can be expected by chance. This rationale differs strongly from classical meta-analyses. \n\n\n### 2.2 Assessing publication bias in coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nPublication bias occurs when the results from published and unpublished studies differ systematically. Publication bias becomes problematic for meta-analysis when studies that are included in the meta-analysis are a selective subset of all studies (because, for instance, some studies are not available) and hence are not an accurate representation of executed research. If studies are unavailable because they failed to reach publication this is called the file drawer problem, because these studies remain in the file drawer. \n\nOther robustness and publication bias assessment methods have been developed for CBMA methods other than the ALE algorithm. Seed-based d mapping has the most exhaustive number of possibilities to gain insight into the validity and limitations of results by means of sensitivity analyses and procedures to assess the presence of publication bias. As seed-based d mapping is most similar to a classical meta-analysis it is more straightforward to implement classic assessment methods. One specific form of publication bias is small sample bias, a phenomenon where studies that employ small sample sizes are more likely to report biased results. Assessing small sample bias can be done by constructing a funnel plot [ \u2013 ] or performing an Egger test [ \u2013 ] (at voxel or region level). A funnel plot is a scatter plot of effect size against a measure of precision (such as sample size or the inverse of the standard error) [ ]. These plots enable to assess the presence of small sample bias (in which case smaller samples are associated with higher peaks). Small sample bias is a possible manifestation of publication bias but can also be caused by other issues such as heterogeneity in effect sizes. The Egger regression test estimates funnel plot asymmetry and can therefore be used as an indicator for the presence of publication bias [ ]. fMRI studies exhibit great heterogeneity, stemming from the way experiments are constructed, carried out, analyzed and reported [ ]. Funnel plots and Egger tests are highly sensitive to heterogeneity, rendering it difficult to interpret their results in the context of a CBMA. \n\nSeed-based d mapping also allows to perform sensitivity analyses using jackknife-analyses [ ] or leave-one-out analyses [ ] to study how replicable the original findings are. In these procedures, the meta-analysis is repeated with all studies but one to test the stability of the results. If the region of interest remains significant in all or almost all repetitions it can be concluded that the significance of that region is highly replicable. However, one should be aware that failure to replicate the results in one repetition does not automatically implicate high replicability but can indicate that clusters are only due to a small set of studies. If subgroups are present in the dataset, subgroup analyses can be performed to assess whether findings are comparable over subgroups. All of these methods have been implemented in the toolbox for seed-based d mapping (retrieved 30 August 2018 from  ).This is possible because seed-based d mapping proceeds voxelwise and converts test statistics to effect sizes and subsequently computes a weighted average of effect sizes and therefore resembles classical meta-analyses largely. Applying these methods directly to other CBMA algorithms (such as MKDA and ALE) is unfortunately not possible. \n\nMKDA on the other hand resembles the ALE algorithm as it only takes peak location into account. In MKDA it is possible to construct adapted Galbraith plots. Here, for regions of interest, the presence (yes 1 or no 0) of activation peaks in that region for study each is plotted as a function of sample size. Subsequently a logistic regression is fitted that should pass through the intercept if no small sample bias is present. \n\n\n### 2.3 ALE meta-analysis \n  \nThe ALE procedure consists of determining whether the spatial convergence of foci or local maxima across studies is larger than can be expected by chance. An overview is given in  . While the result of an fMRI data analysis is a statistical parametric map, often only peak locations are reported. In the ALE algorithm, these reported foci are entered into an empty brain by assigning them a value of 1, all other voxels have a value of 0. For every study a map is constructed with its reported foci. In a next step this value of 1 is smeared out by smoothing to neighbouring voxels by means of a Gaussian kernel of which the size depends on the sample size of the study. Small studies have less statistical power and more spatial uncertainty and therefore kernel size increases with decreasing sample size. The resulting map is called a modelled activation (MA) map and represents for each voxel the probability of one of the activation foci being present in that voxel. Subsequently the MA-maps are combined into one ALE-map by taking the union of probabilities ( ). For every voxel with coordinates (x, y, z), the ALE value in the map is the result of taking the union of the MA-values of that voxel over the k studies entered into the meta-analysis. \n   Step-by-step overview of the ALE algorithm.  \nFrom an entire Statistical Parametric Map (SPM) usually only peak coordinates (foci) are reported. These are entered in an empty brain for every study individually. Spatial uncertainty is accounted for by constructing Gaussian kernels around the foci of which the size depends on the sample size of that study (smaller studies have more spatial uncertainty and larger kernels). The result of this process is a set of MA-maps. An ALE-map is constructed by calculating the union of the MA-maps. Eventually the ALE-map is thresholded to determine at which locations the convergence of foci is larger than can be expected by chance. \n  \nThresholding of the resulting ALE map can be done both voxelwise (uncorrected, or with multiple testing corrections to control the False Discovery Rate FDR or the Family Wise Error FWE rate) or on cluster-level. In the case of voxel-level thresholding, a null distribution is constructed based on the null hypothesis that foci are randomly spread throughout the brain. This null distribution contains all possible ALE values that can be obtained by making all possible combinations of voxels in the MA-maps inside the mask. We can illustrate this with a simplified example. Imagine a meta-analysis of 3 studies, each with 11 voxels inside the mask. The first value in the null distribution is obtained by computing the ALE-value resulting from the combination of the MA-values in voxel 1 of study 1, voxel 1 of study 2 and voxel 1 of study 3. The second value is the result of the combination of voxel 1 of study 1, voxel 1 of study 2 and voxel 2 of study 3. This process is repeated until all 1331 possible ALE-values are known. The resulting vector of possible ALE-values can be visualised as a histogram and is used as a null distribution to obtain voxel-level thresholds. On top of a voxel-level threshold, a cluster-level threshold can be added by randomly distributing the MA-values throughout the brain, performing the same voxel-level threshold and listing the size of the largest resulting cluster. This process is repeated (e.g. 1000 times) and the distribution of cluster sizes is used to compute a cluster-level threshold. The authors of the ALE algorithm advise to employ a voxel- or cluster-level family-wise error correction (FWE) [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.4 The FSN for an ALE meta-analysis \n  \nIn this paper, the FSN is defined as the amount of contra-evidence that can be added to a meta-analysis before the results of that meta-analysis are changed. The FSN can be obtained for each region that survives thresholding in an ALE meta-analysis. Note that it is not possible to enter studies without any peaks in the ALE algorithm because adding studies without foci does not change the results of the meta-analysis. In  , it can be seen that if an MA  of 0 is entered into this formula, the second part is multiplied by 1 and hence the ALE-value is not affected. In addition, the null distribution of the ALE-values also remains unaltered. This implies that ALE is insensitive to null studies. We are however interested in assessing the number of studies that do not report foci in a region of interest that can be added before spatial convergence of foci in the region is no longer statistically significant but such studies can report foci in other regions. We therefore conceptualize contra-evidence for studies in the ALE meta-analysis as noise studies that report foci randomly distributed throughout the brain. ALE meta-analysis findings change when such noise studies are added into the meta-analysis. Eickhoff and colleagues have shown that adding random coordinates to an ALE meta-analysis has a limited impact on the resulting ALE values, even if they overlap with the cluster of interest [ ]. The threshold however does change. By adding foci, the null distribution used to compute the threshold changes, with only larger ALE values surviving statistical thresholding. \n\nCurrently, the FSN measure is rarely employed in classical meta-analyses. The measure has been criticized for a variety of reasons [ ,  \u2013 ] which essentially boil down to having different possibilities for conceptualizing a null finding and its focus on statistical instead of practical significance. These critiques do not apply directly to the context of ALE coordinate-based meta-analyses. First, the definition of null findings can be defined rather unambiguous as ALE only requires the location of peak voxels as input. Randomly sampled peaks show no convergence of foci and are therefore an adequate representation of a study with null findings with respect to a specific region. Secondly, the input on which ALE meta-analyses are based is in essence binary (active versus non-active) due to censored reporting based on statistical significance. This precludes the calculation of effect sizes that are employed in classical meta-analysis. \n\nThe FSN is a measure of robustness against potential publication bias. It indicates the stability of meta-analytical results when results that may differ systematically from the other studies are included in the meta-analysis. If studies are added that remain otherwise hidden in the file drawer, researchers can assess how the file drawer problem may affect their results. A higher FSN indicates more stable results and hence a higher robustness. To aid interpretation of results, a minimum FSN that indicates vulnerability to the file-drawer effect is needed. Rosenthal provided a guideline of 5k + 10 (with k the number of studies in the original meta-analysis) as minimum for the FSN, but this is specifically adapted to behavioural studies [ ]. It can be expected that the number of studies remaining in the file drawer is lower for fMRI studies than for behavioural studies as fMRI studies are often more costly and time-demanding. It is key that a researcher determines a minimum FSN specific for the area of research. A recent paper estimates the number of studies or experiments with no foci that remain unnoticed in fMRI meta-analyses [ ]. Using the Brainmap database with data on the number of foci reported for specific contrasts or experimental conditions that are tested in fMRI studies, the authors predict for different areas of research the number of studies that report no local maxima. The results indicate that the number of missing contrasts is at least 6 for every 100 studies published, but the number can be as high as 50 out of 100 studies for some research domains. In addition, the authors provide confidence intervals for the estimators for the missing contrasts. While the estimates [ ] may be not all-encompassing as assessing the amount of hidden studies remains a great challenge, these results can aid in determining a minimum FSN but should not be the sole driving force for this. \n\nIt has further been shown that some studies may have a large impact on final results [ ]. Through massive simulations the authors showed that, even if appropriate thresholding was applied, the two most dominant experiments, i.e. the experiments that contributed most to the observed ALE-value in the cluster of interest, in a meta-analysis account for more than 60% of the total ALE score of a significant cluster. More specifically, if e.g. 25 studies are entered into a meta-analysis, the two most dominant experiments, which is less than 10% of the experiments entered, contribute to between 65% and 75% of the total ALE score of the cluster. For each significant cluster selected by the ALE algorithm, it is important to look at the contribution of each individual study to that cluster. If the FSN for a given region is very high, this means that few studies drive the results for that cluster. For example, when 3 studies out of 10 studies contribute to the results of a specific cluster, there is a contribution from 30% of the studies. However, when the FSN for that same analysis is larger than 100, this means that the cluster remains significant even if less than 3% of the studies contribute to these results. This is indicative for highly influential studies. To detect such cases using the FSN, a practically relevant upper boundary can be defined by delineating the minimum percentage of studies that contribute to a given effect. For example, if 20 out of 50 studies in a meta-analysis contribute to a cluster and one requires that at least 5% of the studies contribute to the cluster of interest, the upper boundary of the FSN is 350. \n\n\n### 2.5 Algorithm to compute FSN for an ALE meta-analysis \n  \nTo compute the FSN, a researcher first needs to generate a set of noise studies for which the results can be added to an existing meta-analysis. We provide R code that can be used to generate noise studies. This code is freely available on GitHub ( ). Once a set of noise studies is obtained, these can be added to the list of original studies in the meta-analysis and the meta-analysis can be rerun using this expanded list of studies. The same toolbox (e.g. GingerALE) as for the original analysis can be used. \n\nTo generate null studies, users first need to read in the same list of foci that was entered in ALE. From this list, the number of peaks and participants per study are saved, each in an individual vector. The researcher has the possibility to indicate the number of noise studies he or she wants to generate. If no number is entered 10k (with k the number of experiments in the original meta-analysis) noise studies are generated. The number of peaks and number of participants of these noise studies are randomly sampled from the previously saved vectors. If the original meta-analysis only contains studies with less than 20 subjects, the noise studies will also have less than 20 subjects. Likewise, if the studies in the meta-analysis reported between 10 and 20 foci, the simulated noise studies will also report between 10 and 20 foci. A lot of variability in sample size and number of reported peaks exists. By reusing the sample sizes and number of peaks we assume that studies that remain in the file drawer are similar to the published studies with respect to these parameters. If there is however evidence that the studies remaining in the file drawer have specific sample sizes or number of peaks, it is possible to change these parameters in the R program. To ensure that all peaks lie within the grey matter of the brain, the location of these peaks are sampled from within the mask used by the ALE algorithm to anatomically limit meta-analyses to grey matter regions. \n\nDetermining the FSN is an iterative process as each time, a different number of noise studies are added to the meta-analysis. Performing multiple ALE meta-analyses is a time-demanding process. Pre-specifying boundaries between which the FSN will be sought reduces the number of steps dramatically. The lower boundary can be set to the predefined minimum FSN while the upper boundary can be determined by pre-defining the minimum percentage of studies that contribute to a given effect. \n\nIn many cases, it may be sufficient to know whether the FSN is lower than the lower bound (indicating non-robustness against publication bias) or whether the FSN is higher than the upper bound (indicating that results are driven by a small number of influential studies). When the FSN lies between the boundaries, it means that results are sufficiently robust and are supported by at least the desired minimum of contributing studies. To know where the FSN is situated in comparison to the boundaries, only two additional meta-analyses need to be run: a meta-analysis for which the number of noise studies equals the lower boundary and a meta-analysis where the number of noise studies equals the upper boundary. \n\nComputing the exact FSN is however more computationally intensive. To reduce the number of computational steps we present a step-wise algorithm that is usually able to compute the FSN in 15 steps or less. An illustrated example of the algorithm can be found in  . Here we provide pseudocode to illustrate the algorithm:\n   \nRun an ALE meta-analysis of interest containing k studies (in the example k = 15) and choose a specific statistically significant cluster for which the FSN will be determined. \n  \nRe-run the meta-analysis with the original studies with m noise studies added where m is the pre-specified lower boundary for the FSN (in the example m = 30). \n\nPossible results:\n   \nThe cluster is no longer statistically significant: STOP. Adding m studies alters the significance of your results. This indicates that results may not be robust when bias due to missing (noise) studies in the meta-analysis is present. \n  \nThe cluster remains statistically significant: proceed to step 3. \n  \n  \nAdd M noise studies with M the pre-specified upper boundary for the FSN (in the example M = 150). \n\nPossible results:\n   \nThe cluster is no longer statistically significant. The FSN lies between the pre-specified lower boundary m and upper boundary M. Set M* = M and m* = m and calculate N as the average of M* and m*. Proceed to step 4. \n  \nThe cluster remains statistically significant: the FSN is higher than the pre-specified upper boundary M. This indicates that results for the cluster may be driven by a small number of studies. STOP or choose a higher upper boundary for the FSN. Set the lower boundary to your currently specified upper boundary. Start again from step 2. \n  \n  \nPerform a meta-analysis with k activated studies and an addition of N noise studies. \n\nPossible results:\n   \nThe cluster is no longer statistically significant: remove N- N  noise studies with N  the average of N and m*. \n\nThis replaces N by N , M* by N and m* remains unaltered. \n  \nThe cluster remains statistically significant: add N \u2013N noise studies studies with N  the average of N and M*. \n\nThis replaces N by N , m* by N and M* remains unaltered. \n  \n  \nRepeat step 4 and continue to add and\/or remove noise studies until the FSN is determined. \n  \n   Illustrated example of the algorithm used to compute the FSN of a meta-analysis of 15 experiments (k = 15).  \nThe predefined lower boundary is set to 30 (2k) and the predefined upper boundary is set to 150 (10k). First an ALE meta-analysis is run while a number of noise studies equal to the lower boundary is added to the original dataset. If the cluster is no longer statistically significant the FSN is smaller than the predefined minimum. If the cluster is still statistically significant after these noise studies are added, a second analysis is run by adding the number of noise studies defined by the upper boundary. If the cluster is still statistically significant the FSN is larger than the upper boundary, if it is no longer statistically significant the FSN lies somewhere between the predefined lower boundary and upper boundary. To reduce the number of steps needed to be taken to determine the FSN the number of noise studies added in the next step is the average of the lower boundary and upper boundary FSN. Is the cluster still statistically significant, then the lower boundary is changed to the number of noise studies that was added. If the cluster is no longer statistically significant this number now becomes the upper boundary. This process is repeated until the lower boundary and upper boundary are only one number apart, and the FSN is known. In this example the FSN is equal to 80. \n  \n\n\n## 3. Example \n  \n### 3.1 Method \n  \nTo demonstrate the principle of the FSN we replicate a previously executed meta-analysis. We select a meta-analysis on finger tapping [ , ] from the BrainMap database that was used to demonstrate the working of GingerALE [ \u2013 ]. In total 38 papers (347 subjects) with a total of 654 activation foci are obtained. The replication differs from the original meta-analysis in one aspect. In the original meta-analysis one study could report multiple experiments with the same subjects, and these experiments would be interpreted as different studies. 73 experiments, coming from 38 studies, were reported. Using correlated data by reporting multiple experiments on the same set of subjects is problematic and induces bias [ , ]. Therefore, in this example all contrasts that stem from the same study with the same set of subjects are reported as one experiment [ ]. All data, analysis procedures and results can be found on GitHub ( ). \n\nAs an example, we base the minimum FSN on results in [ ]. It is estimated for normal mapping that a 95% confidence interval for the number of studies that report no local maxima varies from 5 to 30 per 100 published studies. Using the upper bound and the fact that the meta-analysis consists of 38 experiments, a possible estimate for the number of experiments that remain in the file drawer is 11. Therefore, the minimum FSN is defined as 11. Since the number of contributing studies differs for every cluster the upper boundary varies between clusters. For clusters 1 to 10 the number of contributing studies is 33, 29, 19, 19, 14, 14, 11, 9, 10 and 6 respectively. If we aim to have at least 10% study contribution, the upper boundary for clusters 1\u20137 respectively is equal to 292, 252, 152, 152, 102, 102, 76, 76, 76 and 76. \n\nFoci from the individual studies are obtained from the BrainMap database. The aforementioned R program ( ) is used to generate noise studies. After reading in the list of foci the distributions of the sample sizes and number of reported peaks are saved. Based on these distributions noise studies are constructed and saved into a text-file with the correct lay-out for the ALE algorithm. New text-files are created by pasting the desired number of noise studies after the studies of the original meta-analysis. The resulting text-files with lists of foci are entered into GingerALE 2.3.6 and meta-analyses are performed until the FSN is known for every cluster. The analysis is thresholded with a cluster-level FWE correction of p < 0.05 (cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.001, uncorrected), 1000 permutations are performed. \n\n\n### 3.2 Results \n  \nAfter thresholding 10 statistically significant clusters are found, these are reported in  . The location of these clusters is plotted in  . The clusters varied in size from 1144mm  to 20488mm . Convergence of foci is found bilaterally in areas responsible for motor functioning, namely the putamen, the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex and the insular cortex, somatosensory areas, namely the primary somatosensory cortex and areas involved in reading and semantic processing, namely the supramarginal gyrus. In the left hemisphere convergence of foci is detected in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus, while in the right hemisphere convergence of foci was found in the pars opercularis, dentate, globus pallidus and medial dorsal nucleus. These regions are suggested to be involved in the motor aspect of speech and voluntary movement. \n   Cluster-level thresholded ALE map of a meta-analysis on finger tapping.  \nALE maps were computed using GingerALE 2.3.6 with a cluster-level forming threshold of p < 0.05 (cluster-forming threshold p < 0.001, uncorrected), visualised with Mango. \n     Volume, weighted center and local maxima of the 7 clusters resulting from the ALE meta-analysis.        \nThe FSN for every cluster is displayed in  . The FSN exceeds the upper boundary for 6 out of 10 clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), indicating a robust convergence of foci in these regions but also indicating that proportionally little studies are needed to obtain this effect. For 3 clusters (clusters 7, 8 and 9) the FSN lies between the lower and upper boundary but for 1 cluster (cluster 10) the FSN is smaller than the predefined minimum. The region covered by this cluster is the pars opercularis. This area is suggested to be involved in semantic tasks and the motor aspect of speech. We see that in the areas like the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex the FSN often exceeds the upper boundary, while clusters that involve deeper structures such as the putamen have a lower FSN. \n   Properties and FSN of the clusters resulting from the meta-analysis.        \n\n\n## 4. Simulations \n  \n### 4.1 Method \n  \nTo study the influence of study parameters, such as number of peaks per study, sample size and thresholding method employed by the ALE algorithm, on the result of the FSN, we simulate meta-analysis sets. These sets consist of lists of peaks that are divided into studies. Each meta-analysis set consists of 3 studies that report local maxima close to the location of activation peak, we call these activated studies, and of 100 noise studies that report local maxima elsewhere in the brain. The number of activated studies is arbitrarily chosen and might seem small. However, Eickhoff et al. have shown that as little as 2 experiments often cause more than half of the total ALE value of a cluster [ ]. To determine the location of the local maxima, the brain is divided into 4 quadrants ( ). In quadrant 1 the peaks of the 3 activated studies are sampled at a random distance from the location of true activation (x = 46, y = -66, z = -6 in MNI space which is the standard brain space used by the ALE algorithm to map locations in the brain). The distance between the location of true activation and the simulated activation is measured in voxels and sampled from a normal distribution (Distance ~ N(0,1)). This location is randomly chosen. The peaks of the noise studies are randomly selected from a list of voxels inside quadrants 2, 3 and 4 ( ). In that way, false peaks are hypothesised to be randomly distributed throughout the brain while true peaks are hypothesised to lie close to the location of true activation, with a higher chance of being close to the location of true activation than lying further away from it. By working with quadrants, we further ensure that no overlap would exist between true activation peaks and noise peaks, but Eickhoff et al. have shown that influence of overlapping would have been minimal [ ]. \n   Visualisation of the 4 quadrants the brain is divided into for simulation.  \nThe blue dot represents the true location of activation and the peaks of the 3 activated studies are sampled around this location. To avoid interference between the activated and the noise studies, the peaks of the noise studies are sampled from quadrants 2, 3 and 4 (darker shades of grey). \n  \nTo assess the effect of number of reported peaks per study 3 scenarios are simulated. In a first scenario, every study reports 1 peak. Although a large number of experiments in the BrainMap database merely report 1 peak, it is unlikely that all studies in a meta-analysis report 1 local maximum. Therefore, we extract the distribution of local maxima that are reported by the studies present in the BrainMap database. The number of reported peaks lies between 1 and 98, with an average of 8, and the median equal to 5. In a second scenario every study reports 8 peaks while in a third scenario the number of peaks per study reported varies and is sampled from the distribution of reported peaks listed by studies included in the BrainMap database. \n\nTo evaluate the effect of sample size, 3 copies of the 3000 meta-analysis sets are created. The only difference between these copies is the average sample size. The sample size of the 3 activated studies varies and is drawn from a normal distribution with standard deviation 1 and average equal to 10 (small sample size), 20 (average sample size) or 30 (large sample size). The sample size of the smallest of the 3 activated studies is used as the sample size of the noise studies and remains the same over all 100 noise studies. Small studies use a larger kernel size in the smoothing step and therefore have a larger influence on the end result. By using the smallest sample size for the noise studies, we ensure that the noise studies have at least as much weight on the final result as the activated studies. To compute the FSN, ALE meta-analyses are performed with a varying number of noise studies until the tipping point of statistical significance is found. Data obtained through simulations is used for validation and the Matlab implementation of ALE is used (Eickhoff, personal communication). \n\nWe apply 2 different methods for thresholding, namely voxelwise Family-Wise Error Rate (vFWE, p < 0.05) and a cluster-level FWE thresholding (p < 0.05) with uncorrected cluster-forming threshold (p < 0.001). For the voxel-level thresholding methods no additional minimum cluster size is employed. 100 permutations are performed to determine the cluster-level threshold. \n\nThe simulations are illustrated in  . In total 18 different scenarios are simulated, for every scenario 1000 simulations are performed. For every one of the 18.000 meta-analyses the FSN is determined by repeatedly adding and removing noise studies until the tipping point of for the cluster of interest is found. Due to computational complexity, we stopped when adding 100 noise studies did not alter results. Datasets and code are available on GitHub ( ). \n   Visualisation of simulation conditions with 3 activated studies and 5 noise studies.  \nThe visualisation is simplified to 2D slices with z = 0. In the activated simulations coordinates are entered into 3D space, resulting in a larger spread. In the first pane we see the scenario with 1 peak per study. The peaks from the 3 activated studies lie in quadrant 1, the peaks from the noise studies lie in the other 3 quadrants. The pane in the middle represents the scenario with 8 peaks per study. The activated studies each have eight peaks in quadrant 1, resulting in 24 peaks close to each other. The 5 noise studies each have 8 peaks in the remaining 3 quadrants. Their peaks will never lie in quadrant 1. Due to the random location of peaks some overlap and spurious activation might occur. The influence of this spurious activation is minimal after 1000 simulations. In the right pane the scenario with a random number of peaks is shown. The 3 activated studies have 5, 11 and 2 peaks respectively. The 5 noise studies have peaks in the remaining quadrants, with 2, 12, 4, 11 and 5 peaks respectively. \n  \n\n### 4.2 Results \n  \nResults are reported in   and visualised in  . A difference in FSN is seen for the choice of thresholding method, the sample size of the individual studies and the number of peaks. The results for voxel-and cluster-level Family-Wise Error Rate are comparable to one another, especially in the most ecologically valid scenario with a random number of peaks per study. In the scenario of 1 peak per study and voxel-level Family-Wise Error Rate correction on average 3% of the studies in the meta-analysis stem from the original meta-analysis, the rest are noise studies. However, in the other two cases this is on average between 6% and 9%. In every condition, less than 1\/10 studies contribute to the activated cluster. A possible explanation for the robustness of the results is that the reported peaks lie close to each other, which results in a large ALE-value. \n   Boxplots of simulations with the FSN in all three scenarios.  \nOn the x-axis the thresholding method and average number of participants per experiment can be found. On the y-axis a boxplot of the number of noise studies that can be added to a meta-analysis of 3 studies with activation before the target area is no longer statistically significant is plotted. In panel A results for the scenario with 1 peak per study are shown, in panel B results for the second scenario, with 8 peaks per study and finally in panel C the results for studies with a random number of peaks are shown. \n     Average (and standard deviation) of the Fail-Safe N for different simulation parameters.      \nA positive effect on robustness can be observed for sample size. For voxel- and cluster-level Family-Wise Error Rate correction the FSN of meta-analyses with bigger sample sizes is larger. \n\nThe number of peaks has an important impact on the number of noise studies that can be added and interacts with the selected thresholding method. Significant effects are mostly driven by a small proportion of studies in the extreme case of 1 peak per study. A ceiling effect can be observed because we did not add more than 100 noise studies. Adding 100 noise studies to a meta-analysis of only 3 studies implicates that less than 3% of the studies in the meta-analysis contribute to a significant effect. \n\nWe downloaded all papers present in the BrainMap database on 26\/10\/2017. After listing the reported number of local maxima in every experiment we see that on average for every experiment 8 peaks are reported. In this more realistic scenario, the FSN drops for every condition and the results for voxel- and cluster-level FWE are comparable. The average FSN in the third version, where a random number of peaks sampled from the real distribution of the BrainMap database, does not differ a lot from the average of the second version with 8 peaks per study. There is however a greater variability present in the results, again showing that results depend on specific parameters of the meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## 5. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we focus on a specific form of publication bias, the file-drawer problem. Publication bias occurs when the results of published and unpublished studies differ significantly. In the case of the file-drawer problem studies that do not show statistically significant results or show results that do not match the hypothesis of the researcher fail to get published. We proposed an algorithm that implements the principles of the Fail-Safe N (FSN) for ALE meta-analyses of fMRI studies, providing a measure for assessing robustness of a statistically significant cluster. \n\nThrough an ALE meta-analysis on finger tapping, we illustrate how the algorithm can be used to obtain the FSN. The ALE analyses resulted in 10 statistically significant clusters. Noise studies are generated that resemble the studies present in the meta-analysis as much as possible. The FSN is computed for every cluster and is shown to diverge strongly. While for most clusters the FSN exceeds the minimum and for 6 studies even the predefined maximum, one cluster only requires less than 11 noise studies to be rendered statistically non-significant. Differences in robustness of the various clusters is shown, previously difficult to ascertain even if volume and extrema value are taken into account. \n\nSimulations show that thresholding method, individual study sample size and number of peaks influence the resulting FSN. The results also show the importance of large sample sizes. fMRI studies tend to employ small sample sizes, mainly due to the high costs of executing a study, but this has several disadvantages. First the power will subsequently drop significantly, making it more difficult to detect an effect. As typically only peak locations are reported this increases the chance of consistent small effects remaining undetected. Second, small studies are prone to employ a more lenient threshold to compensate for low power. This leads to an increase in false positives and more noise in the meta-analysis. The FSN assesses the impact of a specific form of publication bias, the file drawer problem, but the impact of selective reporting (less than 1% of data obtained in an fMRI study is reported) cannot be ignored in this respect. Researchers should therefore verify whether an activated cluster is mainly driven by large or small studies and interpret results accordingly. \n\nWe also note that the number of peaks has a significant influence on the FSN. Depending on the software used for the fMRI data-analysis and the thresholding method, some papers consistently report more peaks than others, and therefore have a bigger influence on the results of the meta-analysis. While some studies report 1 activated peak for a relatively large cluster, other studies might report 3 peaks inside a relatively small cluster. The ALE algorithm compensates this by taking the maximum of overlapping kernels within the same study (in the MA-map), but it is impossible to completely neutralize this reporting bias.The algorithm to generate noise studies generates peaks at random locations throughout the brain but does not specifically allow the generation of multiple peaks per cluster. While a peak that lies very close to another peak has limited influence on the meta-analysis, as is also illustrated in Eickhoff et al. [ ], peaks that are spatially close but with non-overlapping kernels will influence the null distribution of ALE-values used in the thresholding phase because the number of contributing peaks and voxels will change (with more peaks, the more conservative the threshold becomes). The distance between peaks however does not influence the null distribution. This implies that a user can adapt the number of peaks to resemble scenarios where multiple peaks per cluster are reported but it is not necessary to manipulate the distance between generated peaks. When kernels around peaks partly overlap, thresholds will become slightly less conservative as compared to fully separated peaks but this has limited consequences on final results. \n\nThe FSN can likewise be computed on results of other coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques. A researcher merely needs to generate noise studies through the tool and put the coordinates in a format adapted to the respective toolbox. These noise studies can then be used to determine the FSN. In principle meta-analysis coordinates, and therefore also coordinates of noise studies, can easily be transformed to a format fit for MKDA or seed-based d mapping. However, since each technique for coordinate-based meta-analyses entails a different approach to combining results of fMRI studies, it might be sensible to conceptualise the FSN, and in particular the contra-evidence, in a different way. For example, while studies with no activation peaks do not alter ALE results, they might have an impact in the other approaches. \n\nOne might question the existence of the file drawer problem in the field of fMRI. fMRI studies may suffer from low statistical power to detect a true effect (underpowered studies). To compensate, thresholds that are lower than conventional (e.g. uncorrected for multiple testing) may be used to obtain positive results. While such practices contribute to the abundance of false positive findings in literature, they do not preclude the existence of publication bias. Both types of biases are symptoms of the focus on positive findings. It is important to realize that even when statistical power is high (either due to lenient thresholding or large sample sizes), even true effects will remain undetected in some studies. Furthermore, in the context of fMRI, a study failing to get published might have other causes, such as obtaining statistically significant results that are not in line with a hypothesis (e.g. when activity is found in other regions contradicting existing models). While the extent of the file drawer problem in fMRI is currently largely unknown, recent work in [ ] aims to answer this question and provides means for investigating its existence. \n\nWhile the FSN does not directly quantify to which degree the meta-analysis may suffer from the file-drawer problem, it provides the possibility to assess the robustness of the meta-analysis against this form of publication bias and can be used for CBMA methods that take peak location into account. Further, it would be of great interest to directly assess the amount of publication bias and to correct for it. In classical meta-analysis techniques (based on summarizing effect sizes), this is for instance possible with the trim and fill method [ ], that looks at the asymmetry present in a funnel plot and tries to fill the gap. The method of Vevea and Woods [ ] corrects for publication bias by adjusting weights assigned to different studies based on study characteristics that could influence likeliness of publication, such as statistical significance. While such methods could be translated to neuroimaging studies as shown in [ ] for a single outcome such as brain volume or correlation between regions or to corrections at voxel-level when effect sizes are used as in seed-based d-mapping [ ], extending this to settings where only peak locations instead of effect sizes are used is not straightforward. \n\nIn this paper, we focussed on the file-drawer problem, though other forms of publication bias exist as well. The FSN assesses the impact of a specific form of publication bias, but the impact of selective reporting (less than 1% of data obtained in an fMRI study is reported) cannot be ignored. \n\n\n## 6. Conclusion \n  \nMeta-analyses are frequently used to combine fMRI data over studies and labs to further build knowledge on the functioning of the brain. Interpretation of final results should therefore also entail assessing how robust results remain in the presence of for example publication bias where only a subsect of selective studies is part of the analysis. We introduce an adaptation of the Fail Safe N (FSN) in the meta-analysis of fMRI studies that greatly aids researchers in assessing robustness of their results. This is the first algorithm that allows assessing cluster robustness to noise and the cluster\u2019s sensitivity to publication bias. For every cluster resulting from the fMRI meta-analysis the FSN can be computed, showing the number of noise studies that can be added before the cluster is no longer statistically significant. We provide a tool that generates noise studies that are based on the number of foci and sample sizes of the studies that are originally entered into the meta-analysis. This tool is accompanied by a step-by-step guide on how to compute the FSN, facilitating its computation. The process is further illustrated in a comprehensive example provided in this manuscript. \n\nWe additionally show the influence of different study parameters on the FSN through extensive simulations. The simulations confirm that robustness increases with sample size and that number of foci has a strong influence on the FSN. By showing the influence of individual study parameters such as number of foci and sample size on the FSN, we mark the importance of generating noise studies that are similar to the original studies. In conclusion, the adaptation of the FSN for fMRI meta-analysis provides a measure for robustness of resulting clusters and their sensitivity to publication bias which provides an added value to the interpretation of brain regions selected as statistically significant by the ALE algorithm accordingly. \n\n\n## Appendix \n  \nIllustration of the classic Fail-Safe N. \n\nAssume   k   independent studies where for each individual study   i  , a   Z  -value and one-tailed p-value   p   is used to test the null hypothesis   H  :   \u03b8   = 0, with   \u03b8   representing an effect size.

The dataset consists of 19 randomized studies, with one-tailed probability values ranging from 0.0158 to 0.9255. The Stouffer sum of   [ ]. If we use this information to compute the Fail-Safe N we get:\n \n\nThis means that 23 studies with a z-value of 0 need to be added to render the previously statistically significant results non-significant. This is less than the proposed 105 and caution is advised when interpreting the results about the teacher expectancy effect. Imagine if in total 42 studies were executed but 23 of these studies remain in the file-drawer because they showed no statistical significant effect. Adding these studies to the meta-analysis would reduce the sum of Z  to 0. In another example from the original paper of Rosenthal on interpersonal self-fulfilling prophecies the FSN is N = 3263 where k = 94 [ ]. We can be more confident about these results as it seems highly unlikely that 3263 studies remain unpublished. \n\nIn classic meta-analysis the FSN is calculated by computing the average z-value or effect size and deducting the number of studies that can be added before this summary statistic is below a certain threshold. In the meta-analysis of fMRI studies however we want to compute the FSN for a cluster where there is statistically significant spatial convergence of foci over studies. Combining these would be challenging. Furthermore typically only the location (and sometimes the height) of voxels that exceed a statistical threshold are reported, which makes computing a summary value even more challenging. The ALE algorithm solves this by computing for each voxel a union of probabilities (peak or not) instead of a sum or average. Therefore the classic implementation of the FSN cannot be applied here. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6267999,"text_md5":"11ec6e21392ae2aea4411da92e54e078","field_positions":{"authors":[0,77],"journal":[78,86],"publication_year":[88,92],"title":[103,223],"keywords":[237,237],"abstract":[250,2457],"body":[2466,60652]},"batch":1,"pmid":30500854,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0208177","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6267999","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6267999"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6267999\">6267999<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6267999  Assessing robustness against potential publication bias in Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses for fMRI"}

ABERRANT TIMING AND SALIENCE NETWORK IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: FINDINGS FROM A META-ANALYSIS\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) affects several domains of cognitive function. Abnormal time and novelty processing, which is related to change detection, has been reported in this disorder. Timing and oddball tasks can be used to assess change detection in perceptual processes. We hypothesize that an impaired timing network underlies disruptive cognitive functioning in SZ, such as saliency detection. Therefore, timing dysfunction might be a primary cognitive deficit in this disorder. \n\nTo address this issue, our aim was to elucidate the neural areas underlying target detection and timing in SZ, as well as to determine whether the timing dysfunctional activity pattern showed by SZ patients matches the pattern involved in attention salience processing. The final purpose of our study was to identify the brain structures activated during both timing and oddball tasks in patients with SZ, as compared to healthy controls (HC). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted two independent comprehensive literature searches of whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that compared patients with SZ and HC using oddball and timing tasks. The searches were conducted with PubMed engine up to November 2017. Keywords used in the first search were: \u201cschizophrenia\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d plus \u201ctiming\u201d or \u201ctime perception\u201d or \u201ctime estimation\u201d. In the second search keywords used were: \u201cschizophrenia\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d plus \u201cevent-related\u201d, plus \u201coddball\u201d. \n\nWe excluded studies that 1) used a region-of-interest approach; 2) did not report peak coordinates for the relevant contrast; 3) used different statistical thresholds in different regions of the brain; 4) used techniques other than fMRI; 5) were based on Independent Component Analysis; 6) were case reports, qualitative studies, reviews or meta-analyses. \n\nWe ran two independent signed differential mapping (SDM) meta-analyses of fMRI studies conducting comparisons between HC and patients with SZ: one reporting brain activation patterns during an oddball task, and a second one using timing tasks. We carried out a final multimodal meta-analysis to combine the findings from the two previous SDM meta-analyses. The aim of this multimodal analysis was to detect brain regions that are activated or deactivated by both timing and oddball tasks in SZ. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur initial search returned 173 papers, but application of inclusion criteria reduced this number to 8. Among them, 3 studied timing (which included a total of 53 SZ patients and 60 HC) and 5 examined oddball paradigm (which included a total of 100 SZ patients and 122 HC). \n\nRelative to HC, patients with SZ showed significantly hypoactivation in right striatum, right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9 and 45), and right median cingulate \/ paracingulate gyri (BA 32) during timing tasks. For oddball tasks, even if they showed significantly decreased activation in right inferior parietal gyri (BA 40) and corpus callosum, they also exhibited hyperactivation or failure of deactivation in left superior frontal gyrus, and dorsolateral (BA 9). Finally, overlapping was found in regions that were hypoactivated and hyperactivated by oddball tasks in SZ patients relative to HC. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results show that there is a common dysfunctional participation of frontal, cingulate, striatum, and parietal regions in SZ during both timing and oddball tasks. These findings suggest that a deficient timing network underlies attentional salience. However, these results are preliminary and further studies may be conducted to address the specific role of timing on cognition. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n","metadata":{"pmcid":5887562,"text_md5":"6f653d8541d9ee3ccd2d519180a48257","field_positions":{"authors":[0,95],"journal":[96,110],"publication_year":[112,116],"title":[127,216],"keywords":[230,230],"abstract":[243,3941],"body":[3950,3950]},"batch":1,"doi":"10.1093\/schbul\/sby018.858","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5887562","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5887562"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5887562\">5887562<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5887562  S71.

Studies have suggested that HT has a positive association with working memory, but no consistent relationship between HT and neural activity has been shown in any cognitive domain. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the convergence of findings from published randomized control trials studies that examined brain activation changes in postmenopausal women. \n\n Methods:   A systematic search for fMRI studies of neural responses during working memory tasks in postmenopausal women was performed. Studies were excluded if they were not treatment studies and did not contain placebo or blank controls. For the purpose of the meta-analysis, 8 studies were identified, with 103 postmenopausal women taking HT and 109 controls. \n\n Results:   Compared with controls, postmenopausal women who took HT increased activation in the left frontal lobe, including superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), anterior lobe, paracentral lobule (BA 7), limbic lobe, and anterior cingulate (BA 32). Additionally, decreased activation is noted in the right limbic lobe, including parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28), left parietal lobe, and superior parietal lobule (BA 7). All regions were significant at   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 with correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n Conclusion:   Hormone treatment is associated with BOLD signal activation in key anatomical areas during fMRI working memory tasks in healthy hormone-treated postmenopausal women. A positive correlation between activation and task performance suggests that hormone use may benefit working memory. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe influence of hormone treatment (HT) on brain and cognition in postmenopausal women has been a controversial topic. Cross-sectional studies and meta-analyses have promoted the idea that HT might enhance verbal memory performance and decrease the risk for developing dementia in postmenopausal women (Barrett-Connor and Stuenkel,  ; LeBlanc et al.,  ; Maki,  ). Studies indicated that HT users were better protected against cognitive decline and dementia and may have better performance during working memory tasks than non-users (Hogervorst et al.,  ; Davis et al.,  ). Similarly, a follow-up study of women who began hormone use around menopause detected lower cognitive impairment (Bagger et al.,  ). In a memory study, early initiators of HT performed better than late initiators in working memory tasks, including attention, concentration, and mental status (MacLennan et al.,  ). These studies thus suggest that HT may have beneficial effects on the central nervous system. However, other studies pointed out that HT has no detrimental effect on cognitive performance in early postmenopausal women (Davison et al.,  ). Later HTs have no preventive effect on AD and MCI in postmenopausal women (Maki,  ; Sherwin,  ). While most women receiving estrogen plus progestin did not experience clinically relevant adverse effects on cognition compared with placebo, a small increased risk of clinically meaningful cognitive decline occurred in the estrogen plus progestin group (Espeland et al.,  ). There are no adverse or beneficial effects of HT on cognitive function in younger postmenopausal women (Brown,  ). Similarly, large controlled studies have suggested that HT has no beneficial effects on maintaining cognition (Henderson et al.,  ; Mulnard et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Resnick et al.,  ). Moreover, data from the only large randomized controlled trial published to date, the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study, did not confirm these observations and have even suggested an increase in dementia risk for women using hormonal replacement therapy compared to controls (Ryan et al.,  ). Based on currently available data, routine therapeutic use of estrogens in women with AD is not justified (Markou et al.,  ) and should not be used for dementia prevention (NIA,  ). Thus the effect of HT on working memory remains unclear based on the results of studies involving direct manipulations of estradiol level. \n\nInconsistencies in estradiol effects are also observed in structural and functional brain imaging studies. Increases or decreases in activation are often not accompanied by changes in task performance, leading Maki and Resnick (Maki et al.,  ) suggest that brain imaging may be more sensitive to effects of estradiol or other hormones than task performance. Evidence from animal models has found estrogen receptors in numerous sites throughout the brain including the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, brainstem, and cerebral cortex suggesting that estrogen therapy may impact cognitive functioning through potential affects on these brain areas (Brake et al.,  ). It was also shown that estrogens enhance basal forebrain, hippocampus, and cortex cholinergic activity by influencing the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine as well as by increasing the number of cholinergic neurons (Smith et al.,  ). Further, estrogen has been suggested to modulate various neurotransmitters (Moses et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ), increase cerebral blood flow (Greene,  ; Slopien et al.,  ), regulate the formation of synapses, affect neuronal survival (Nilsen et al.,  ; Gleason et al.,  ), influence the expression of APOE, and provide neuroprotective effects, all of which may either directly or indirectly impact cognitive functioning (Slopien et al.,  ). The fMRI results demonstrate that HT, relative to placebo, increased the response of the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, two areas that have been shown to be, respectively, involved during reward anticipation and at the time of reward delivery. Using both visual and verbal working memory tasks, one fMRI study found increased activation bilaterally in the superior frontal gyrus and in the inferior parietal lobule in subjects who were receiving high-dose conjugated equine estrogen compared with controls, while decreases in inferior parietal, which activation for storage of non-verbal material (Shaywitz et al.,  ), have also been reported. Areas of activation were deemed significantly different in the prior findings. \n\nAlthough prior studies have examined the effects of HT on working memory task performance in healthy postmenopause women, to our knowledge, no brain imaging meta-analysis examined the brain activation differences in postmenopausal women. Our study assessed the convergence of findings from published randomized control trials studies that examined brain activation changes in postmenopausal women. A meta-analysis employing the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) method was performed to locate anatomical regions with significant activation differences. The ALE method permits the creation of three-dimensional (3D) probability maps that show the brain regions that are most likely to demonstrate morphometric differences between HT and controls. The frontal lobes are of paramount significance in determining emotions and judgments related to sympathy, which is defined as the ability to perform daily activities, personality manifestations, and decisions (Badre et al.,  ; Tiemeier et al.,  ). Base on the exiting studies (Shaywitz et al.,  ; Greene,  ; Moses et al.,  ; Nilsen et al.,  ; Brake et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Slopien et al.,  ; Gleason et al.,  ), we hypothesize that postmenopausal women who took HT would show increased activation in the frontal lobe, including temporal lobe and the anterior cingulate, brain regions known to be involved in cognition and working memory. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources and inclusion criteria \n  \nA systematic search strategy was performed to identify the relevant studies. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from 1993 to 2014 for all relevant published observational studies and clinical trials. The following key terms were employed: \u201cHT,\u201d \u201cHRT,\u201d \u201cHT,\u201d \u201cERT,\u201d \u201cfunctional MRI or fMRI,\u201d \u201ccognitive dysfunction,\u201d \u201cpostmenopausal,\u201d \u201cbrain activation,\u201d and \u201cworking memory.\u201d The reference lists of these articles were searched to obtain additional relevant studies. All identified articles were reviewed by at least two authors, and studies were included in the meta-analysis based on a consensus decision (see Figure  ). \n  \n Diagram of studies included in the present meta-analysis  . \n  \nTo meet the inclusion criteria, the studies had to (a) report group comparisons between postmenopausal women who received HT and matched controls, (b) employ fMRI, (c) report their results in a standard stereotactic space (either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute space), and (d) investigate working memory or working memory-related tasks. Studies that did not fulfill these requirements were excluded. Treatment, gender, and age were not restricted and the HT brain activation studies did not include a control. \n\nThe data extracted from each study included: a description of (a) each memory task and (b) foci of task-related activation changes in which the active and control states were different between the HT group and the control as well as (c) clinical data concerning hormone dose, years of estrogen use, and the age-matching of the control group. This study examined all foci that were reported as significant based on the above criteria designated in the included studies. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis procedure \n  \nTwo separate ALE meta-analyses were performed: one on fMRI studies reporting that brain activation was increased in postmenopausal women receiving HT compared to controls and a second on studies reporting that brain activation was decreased. \n\nThe meta-analyses were performed using GingerALE software, version 2.1.1 (Laird et al.,  ) . The main idea behind ALE is to treat the reported foci as centers for 3D Gaussian probability distributions to capture the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus. Foci reported for any given study were then combined to a modeled activation (MA) map. The reported foci in the original studies in MNI space were transformed into Talairach space using the tal2icbm algorithm. All ALE data processing was performed using Brain Map Search and View software . Statistical significance was assessed using an analytical equation. The assumption is reasonable for data imaging, based on an assumption of positive dependence (Genovese et al.,  ), and the false discovery rate (FDR) was set at 0.05 to correct the   p  -threshold for multiple comparisons (Laird et al.,  ). Each ALE map was overlaid onto an anatomical template generated by spatially normalizing the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) template to the Talairach space (Kochunov et al.,  ). The resulting regions were anatomically labeled by reference to probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Number of studies found \n  \nThe literature contained eight studies in which the effect of HT was investigated in working memory. In total, the meta-analysis was conducted on 103 postmenopausal women taking HT and 109 controls (see Table  ). These studies include all relevant treatment studies through 2014. Studies were excluded if they did not perform working memory tasks, or included a combination of estrogen and testosterone, or did not include a control group, or included women suffering from cognitive impairment. \n  \n Publications included in the meta-analysis, the tasks they employed, the number of subjects who were investigated, and the mean age of the women and their estrogen dose for the ALE meta-analysis  . \n  \n\n### Changes in neural activation to working memory tasks \n  \nWe performed two ALE analyses to investigate and aggregate the known data that exist regarding the effects of HT on neural activity in postmenopausal women during working memory tasks. The first analysis pooled the results of an increase in neural activation (8 experiments, 73 foci), and the second analysis pooled the results of a decrease in brain activation (3 experiments, 18 foci) (  p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 FDR-corrected; see Table  ; Figure  ). \n  \n Results from the ALE meta-analysis of treatment effects on studies in postmenopausal women (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR-corrected)  . \n  \n Results are shown in Talairach coordinates. Significance threshold is   p  \u2009<\u2009FDR 0.01 and   k  \u2009>\u2009100  . \n    \n ALE map of the postmenopausal women during working memory  . Decreased (green) and increased (red) activity following HT compared with the controls (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01; FDR-corrected;   k  \u2009>\u2009100). \n  \nIn the first meta-analysis, five clusters of increased task-related activity after HT were found in the left frontal lobe, superior frontal gyrus (BA 8), middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), parietal lobe, precuneus (BA 7), paracentral lobule (BA 5), limbic lobe, and anterior cingulate (BA 32) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01 FDR-corrected,   k  \u2009>\u2009100; see Figure  ). \n  \n An ALE map presenting the increased activity in postmenopausal women undergoing HT during working memory tasks compared with the controls (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01; FDR-corrected;   k  \u2009>\u2009100)  . \n  \nSeveral clusters of decreased activation after HT were detected in the second ALE analysis. Clusters of decreased activation were located in the right limbic lobe, parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28), left parietal lobe, and superior parietal lobule (BA 7) (  p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 FDR-corrected; see Table  ; Figure  ). \n  \n An ALE map presenting the decreased activity in postmenopausal women undergoing HT during working memory tasks compared with the controls (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01; FDR-corrected;   k  \u2009>\u2009100)  . \n  \n\n### HT and performance of working memory \n  \nFour papers measured the relationship between HT and performance on verbal memory task. Two studies indicated that HT use increases frontal lobe activity during verbal memory tasks, but the degree of this increase is related to cognitive load (Dumas et al.,  ). One study demonstrated that HT results in changes in neural activation in verbal memory circuits in postmenopausal women and suggests that estrogen may enhance the overall efficiency of verbal memory processes in postmenopausal women (Persad et al.,  ). Another study suggested that HT selectively enhances verbal perseveration and is an important component of executive function by increasing activation in the inferior frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and posterior parietal regions (Joffe et al.,  ). One study indicated that no significant differences in visual task performance were found in response to HT. However, there was evidence that the HT group had both reductions and increases in the amplitude of hemodynamic response in some regions, including the occipital and parietal lobes, motor cortex, anterior cingulate, and PFC (Stevens et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Sub-analyses for estrogen long-term use and short-term use \n  \nIn further sub-analysis, we investigated the effects of estrogen experience. The brain network supporting long experience [usually more than 2\u2009years (Barrett-Connor and Stuenkel,  )] estrogen use (27 Foci, 4 Experiments) included cluster of activity in the left limbic lobe, right frontal lobe, and left anterior lobe. Short experience [usually <2\u2009years (Barrett-Connor and Stuenkel,  )] included clusters of activity in the right front lobe, left front lobe, limbic lobe, and parietal lobe. We get similar behavioral outcomes after excluding short-term estrogen use. This suggests that long-term hormone use have a persisting chronic effect in postmenopausal women. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHistorically, cognitive benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) have not been consistently demonstrated and the brain activation patterns are inconsistent. In this study, we addressed the cognitive effects of hormones in women and performed an ALE meta-analysis on functional brain imaging studies to investigate and aggregate the known data that exist regarding the effects of HT on neural activity in postmenopausal women during working memory tasks. Our results indicate that hormone use is associated with increased regional brain activation during working memory task, with women in hormone-treatment groups exhibiting a more robust neural response than placebo-treated women. Women receiving HT exhibited increases in brain activation in the frontal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (see Table  ; Figure  ), a region where decreased activity can be predictive of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Rasgon et al.,  ). This finding suggests that HT may enhance brain function. The frontal lobe and the ACC may be important for processing lexical information and for the associated cognition and decision-making (Bush et al.,  ). This supports our prior hypothesis that HT maintains a positive effect on working memory processes. \n\nActivation in the frontal lobes has been identified in postmenopausal women after estradiol treatment (Dumas et al.,  ). The frontal lobes are of paramount significance in determining emotions and judgments related to sympathy, which is defined as the ability to perform daily activities, personality manifestations, and decisions (Badre et al.,  ; Tiemeier et al.,  ). The hormone effects on working memory tasks may occur through an effect on the frontal lobe. Activation of frontal regions during memory tasks has been associated with the active maintenance of information (Cohen et al.,  ). Activation in frontal regions during a working memory task has been related to improved performance in older subjects (Davis et al.,  ). Hormones exert a greater modulatory effect on the function of the frontal lobe when working memory load is increased (Dumas et al.,  ), and episodic memory tasks are associated with the frontal lobe (Tulving et al.,  ). fMRI\u2013BOLD signal in the frontal lobes, a region central to memory processing, positively correlated to task accuracy, implying a cognitive benefit to the increased activity measured during the memory task (Joffe et al.,  ; Dumas et al.,  ). \n\nSimilarly, across our ALE meta-analyses, we found that, after HT, postmenopausal women exhibited greater activity in the ACC than controls. The ACC plays an important role in integrating cognitive and emotional processes to support goal-directed behavior (Krause-Utz et al.,  ). On the other hand, ACC is involved in rational cognitive functions, including reward anticipation, impulse control decision-making, empathy (Bush et al.,  ), and emotion (Decety and Jackson,  ; Jackson et al.,  ). This finding in the present study is consistent with the effect of HT on the emotion-processing circuitry in postmenopausal women (Frey et al.,  ; Shafir et al.,  ). However, another study revealed contradictory results in which the BOLD responses were reduced in the dorsolateral PFC and the dorsal anterior cingulate of the HT group compared with the control group during a negative emotion task. These differences between the HT and control groups may reflect a recovery of emotional responsiveness in these older women following HT (Love et al.,  ). \n\nAdditionally, decreased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28), including left parietal lobe and superior parietal lobule (BA 7) (see Table  ; Figure  ), was observed in the HT group. Importantly, these regions may also support cognitive functions, including verbal memory (Zec and Trivedi,  ; Sherwin,  ). The parahippocampal gyrus is a gray matter cortical region of the brain that surrounds the hippocampus. The key role of this region is memory encoding and retrieval. Abnormalities may indicate underlying conditions, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and hippocampal sclerosis (Ferreira et al.,  ). The observation of hyper-activation in the parahippocampal gyrus is consistent with the finding of Dr Maki leading investigators that women receiving HT exhibit decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the right precuneus, the dorsal frontal gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus during a verbal memory task (Resnick et al.,  ). Their later study suggested that deactivation in the left parahippocampal gyrus relates to better verbal memory performance, and this effect was specific to the verbal recognition condition (Maki et al.,  ). Another study found sustained decreases in activation in bilateral regions of parahippocampal cortex, suggesting that the parahippocampal gyrus might become deactivated when participants entered into a sustained state of retrieval during recognition tasks (Donaldson et al.,  ). Together, the findings of decreased parahippocampal activation in perimenopausal HT users suggest that perimenopausal HT enhances both state-dependent and recollective processes contributing to verbal recognition performance. \n\nSub-analyses for estrogen long-term and short-term use revealed almost the same results to the main results of HT group. The goal of this study was to evaluate differences in working memory after hormone use compared to placebo use, so women who recently quit long-term hormones were included along with current hormone users. Apart from a statistically significant difference in mean years of education, these two groups were demographically similar (although the smaller sample size used to compare current and past users may increase the likelihood of a type II error). After accounting for variations in age, education, and age at hormone initiation, long-term users did not have more activation than short-tem users in any part of the brain. Long-term users showed slightly more activation than short-term users in only one small region within the prefrontal cortex. While it is difficult to make conclusions based on one differing region, these results may be consistent with others that have indicated a persisting cognitive benefit to past hormone users (Hogervorst et al.,  ). Other than this region, the activation patterns between these two HT groups were sufficiently similar to justify including them in the same groups when comparing hormone ever-users to placebo-users. \n\nThis study has some limitations. First, methodological limitations led to a small number of available studies, and the sample sizes are small. Second, trials recruit women who may not be representative of the general population. Third, differences among the studies in the education, general health, motivation level, and age. These differences raise the possibility that the controls and HT groups may differ with respect to characteristics that could influence brain function. We consider this limitation unavoidable. Third, many trials are too short to evaluate long-term effect of HT. However, such trials provide more highly reliable evidence of the effectiveness of a treatment than observational studies (Miller and Kearney,  ). Fourth, the functional imaging studies included employed different working memory tasks and the years of estrogen use are various, which could result in a source of heterogeneity. Fifth, the estrogen dose of HT was not identical across the included studies, which may influence the effect of estrogen on postmenopausal women. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present study demonstrated that women who received HT exhibited increases in brain activation in the frontal lobe and ACC. In addition, decreased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28), left parietal lobe, and superior parietal lobule (BA 7) were detected. The results are consistent with our hypothesis. Together, the findings of enhanced frontal lobe activation and decreased parahippocampal activation in perimenopausal HT users suggest that HT enhances both state-dependent and recollective processes contributing to cognitive performance. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nKL designed the study and wrote the protocol.

Furthermore, Meta-regression revealed that GMV reduction in left anterior cingulate were positively correlated with BIS-11 score [  r   = 0.725,   p   = 0.012(uncorrected)] and IAT score [  r   = 0.761,   p   = 0.017(uncorrected)]. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis showed structural and functional impairments in brain regions related to executive control, cognitive function and reward-based decision making in IGD.

Internet gaming disorder (IGD) accounted for 57.5% of all types of Internet addiction among college students ( ) defined as the inability of an individual to control his\/her use of online game behaviors, which has many similarities with pathological gambling ( \u2013 ). Many players exhibit symptoms such as decreased executive function ( ), excessive impulsivity ( ,  ), impaired risky decision-making ability ( ) and craving ( ,  ). Although unlike substance addiction, IGD does not consume addictive substances, it can lead to dependence and mental and physical health problems similar to other addictions due to excessive gaming ( ,  ). Given its growing prevalence and negative effects, IGD has been listed in Section \u201cResults\u201d of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition worthy of further research. Therefore, more evidence is needed to understand the neuropathic factors behind IGD, which will facilitate future research and shed light on the success of its treatment. \n\nAs a non-invasive imaging technique, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has shown great potential value in elucidating the neuropathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to reveal neural changes in addictive disorders ( \u2013 ). Previous studies in functional neuroimaging ( ,  \u2013 ) have revealed that during performing the impulse control-related tasks, IGD subjects had aberrant activations in the frontal, insular, temporal and parietal cortex compared with the HCs. In addition to functional activity changes, gray matter volume (GMV) as a structural marker of the brain may be relatively stable over time and can be used as a basis for functional neural activity ( ). GMV has been widely used in many studies of mental disorders ( \u2013 ). VBM is a voxel-based gray matter volume measurement method that can detect subtle changes in GMV. Previous VBM studies have demonstrated that IGD patients have reduced GMV in brain regions associated with executive control such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved in processing goal-directed behaviors ( ,  ,  ,  ). Therefore, a quantitative synthesis of VBM studies in IGD can provide additional information to complement the results of fMRI studies. The combination of different modalities can more comprehensively identify the common and specific neural changes in IGD. The severity of IGD was measured by Young\u2019s Internet addiction test (IAT). IAT was a reliable and valid instrument for classifying Internet addiction disorder ( ). The clinical relevance of impulsivity was frequently highlighted because it affected many mental and behavioral disorders. Cao and Lee have found that IGD subjects were more impulsive than healthy controls ( ,  ), which may lead to serious impairments in psychological and social functions, such as suicide attempts and crime. The severity of Internet addiction disorder (IAD) was positively correlated with both behavioral impulsivity and self-reported impulsivity ( ). Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) score could well assess the core impulsivity characteristics of addiction ( ). \n\nAlthough many neuroimaging studies have shown changes in brain structure and function in patients with IGD, these findings are inconsistent or even contrary. Consequently, it is of great significance to perform a pooled meta-analysis to provide evidence-based evidence of structural and functional changes in IGD by pooling \u201cobservations\u201d with controls for random effect. A preliminary meta-analysis of 10 VBM studies and 27 fMRI studies has found brain hyperactivation in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, caudate and posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), hypoactivation in the anterior IFG, the posterior insula, and reduced gray-matter volume in the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal ( ). However, in recent years, there have been substantial novel and high-quality studies on this subject. Compared with previous meta-analysis, this study not only included more new studies to explore the neural changes of IGD, but also focused on exploring the relationship between brain GMV and impulsivity in IGD patients. It is high time that we performed an updated meta-analysis to confirm, supplement, and\/or modify the results of previous meta-analysis. \n\nThe purpose of our study was to conduct two meta-analyses separately including numerous proven VBM and fMRI studies and a conjunction analysis between two meta-analyses to explore: (a) brain GMV and functional abnormalities; (b) the association between some common addiction-related clinical features and GMV alterations. Based on previous empirical studies, we hypothesized that IGD subjects compared to HCs would show GMV and functional alterations in brain regions involved in reward-based decision-making such as the inferior prefrontal cortex ( ), cognitive control such as the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus ( ), and visual cognitive functions such as the fusiform ( ). As a reliable structural marker, GMV can easily identify different psychiatric disorders without potentially confounding considerations of tasks in fMRI ( ). Therefore, we also hypothesized that the GMV alterations in IGD subjects would be closely associated with clinical variables such as the IAT score and BIS-11 score. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Inclusion of studies \n  \nExtensive searches were carried out in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2021, combined with the following keywords: (\u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d or \u201cVBM\u201d or \u201cgray matter\u201d or \u201cvoxel-wise\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d) and (\u201conline-game\u201d or \u201cInternet gaming disorder\u201d or \u201cIGD\u201d). Studies were included if (1) they used specific tasks during the MRI scan or they used VBM to analyze gray matter; (2) they provided whole-brain pairwise voxel-based comparisons of patient groups (IGD) relative to controls; (3) the studies reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates of the whole brain; (4) there were no neurological or psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, autism, learning disorder and epilepsy; (5) studies were peer-reviewed and published in English. Studies were excluded if (1) they only reported region of interest findings; (2) peak coordinates were still not available even if we contacted the authors by email; (3) studies used tensor-based morphometry; (4) they were unpublished studies; (5) they didn\u2019t use the same threshold throughout the whole brain within each included study. Three authors independently searched, selected, and cross-checked the literature. Any divergence was settled through a joint revaluation of the original studies. And then we implemented the following steps. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStructural and functional brain differences between individuals with IGD and healthy controls were analyzed by using the anisotropic seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) meta-analytic software, version 5.15 . The AES-SDM method has been well validated in recent meta-analysis of psychiatric diseases ( ,  ). AES-SDM is a statistical technique that can use previously reported peak coordinates and effect sizes (  t  -scores) to calculate signed (positive\/negative) effect sizes and variance maps of brain regional differences between patient and control groups. For each meta-analysis, maps are combined across studies based on the random-effect model, considering sample size, intra-study variability and inter-study heterogeneity ( ). The processing process of AES-SDM data is summarized here . Here we briefly outline the steps: (1) we extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes (  t  -values) from each included study. Sometimes some studies included z-scores without   t  -values, then the z-scores could be converted to t statistics using an online converter ; (2) we converted peak coordinates into standardized MNI space; (3) we set the full width at half maximum (FWHM) to 20 mm as this will maintain a balance between sensitivity. Voxel   p   < 0.005 was used as a significant threshold. Peak height threshold > 1 and cluster extent threshold > 10 voxels were supplemented to optimally balance sensitivity and specificity ( ). \n\nFirst, two meta-analyses including all fMRI and VBM studies were conducted separately to identify neural changes in IGD. Second, a multimodal analysis was further performed on patients and controls to examine overlapping regions of functional and structural abnormalities. Next, a jack-knife sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the robustness of the results by repeating the same analysis excluding one study each time and to assess the reproducibility of the results for each meta-analysis ( ). If one brain region survives in most of the repeats, we consider the finding to be highly replicable. Then meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between GMV alterations and clinical features including the BIS-11 score and IAT score. At last, funnel plots constructed by AES-SDM ( ) and Egger\u2019s test were used to examine possible publication bias ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nSearching in various databases, a total of 1002 records were identified. After removing duplicates, 506 records were screened and 131 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Our final dataset consisted of 15 VBM studies including 422 IGDs and 354 HCs and 30 fMRI studies including 617 IGDs and 550 HCs (  and  ). \n  \nPrisma flow diagram for including eligible studies in the meta-analysis. \n    \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of voxel-based morphometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in internet gaming disorder. \n    \n\n### Meta-analysis result \n  \n#### Voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis \n  \nAs demonstrated in   and  , IGD subjects showed significantly smaller GMV in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), median cingulate cortex (MCC), superior frontal gyrus, medial orbital (SFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and supplementary motor area (SMA) compared with healthy controls. Compared with the control group, there was no significant increase of GMV in the IGD group. \n  \nResults of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for internet gaming disorder (IGD).

Besides, lower activation was also detected in the bilateral lingual, calcarine and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (  and  ). \n  \nResults of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for IGD.

Purple clusters represent reduced GMV and increased brain activation. \n  \n\n\n### Reliability analyses \n  \nFor the VBM meta-analysis, a systematic whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed a highly robust GMV decrease in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and median cingulate cortex (MCC) because these results were replicable in all 15 datasets. Alterations in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) remained highly replicable, as they could be identified in at least 12 and 10 of the 15 combinations respectively. For the fMRI meta-analysis, hypoactivation of bilateral lingual was highly replicable, as these findings were preserved throughout all 30 combinations of datasets. Besides, the results in the left calcarine and left middle frontal gyrus were also significant because they could be identified in 27 and 26 datasets respectively. Hyperactivation of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, right supramarginal, right fusiform, left precuneus and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) remained robust as at least 25 of the 30 combinations were identifiable ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-regression \n  \nIn our study, the variables explored by meta-regression analysis included the BIS-11 score and IAT score. The results showed that GMV reduction in left ACC (MNI coordinate, 0, 28, 22; SDM-Z, \u22123.067;   p   = 0.00001; 477 voxels) was positively correlated with BIS-11 score [  r   = 0.725,   p   = 0.012(uncorrected)] and IAT score [  r   = 0.761,   p   = 0.017(uncorrected)] ( ). \n  \nThe results of the meta-regression analysis show that the BIS-11 and IAT scores are positively correlated to regional GMV reduction in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur study integrated the results of 15 VBM studies and 30 fMRI studies to explore changes in brain GMV and functional neural activation in IGD patients compared to healthy controls, using an anisotropic seed d-Mapping (AES-SDM) method. The result demonstrated that GMV reduction was found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), median cingulate cortex (MCC), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Functionally, IGDs as compared with HCs showed significantly higher activation in the left precuneus, right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), fusiform and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Besides, lower activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the lingual was also detected, stable and replicable under jack-knife sensitivity analysis. In addition, both decreased GMV and increased activation was found in the left ACC among IGD patients. Moreover, meta-regression analysis revealed that higher BIS-11 score and IAT score were correlated with decreased GMV in the left ACC. These findings could become a preliminary implication of neural structural and functional biomarkers in IGD and may help develop effective interventions in these brain regions as potential therapeutic neuro-target for IGD. \n\nConsistent with previous findings in IGD ( ,  ), robust GMV decrease in brain regions involved in executive control, namely, the ACC and the SMA ( ). The ACC plays important roles in the neural activity of several large-scale networks ( ) and is critically involved in multiple processes including cognitive control ( ), emotional regulation ( ), reward-based decision-making ( ), conflict monitoring and error processing ( ). \n\nUnsurprisingly, the results of the VBM and fMRI meta-analyses converged on the ACC, showing both functional hyperactivation and gray-matter reduction in IGDs as compared to HCs, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting that structural or functional alterations in the region lead to impaired executive control ( ,  ). A study by Wang et al. ( ) showed that the GMV of the ACC was negatively correlated with conflict monitoring in the Stroop task. As a functional imaging study demonstrated, IGD individuals exhibited altered brain activity in the ACC during error processing ( ). Although numerous executive control problems have been implicated in IGD as mentioned above, IGD is most consistently associated with high impulsivity ( ). Conflict monitoring capacity is closely associated with impulse control ( ). Our results showed that higher BIS-11 scores are significantly associated with decreased GMV in the left ACC, suggesting that high impulsivity in IGD patients may be due to structural abnormalities in the executive control regions of the brain ( ,  ). Although the direction of the alteration of the ACC is inconsistent across modalities (fMRI and VBM), there is evidence that an increase or decrease in GMV may not simply correspond to functional neural activation or inactivation ( ). Previous studies have been shown that the ACC always activates in the Stroop task involved in conflict monitoring and cognitive control ( \u2013 ). In conclusion, fMRI and VBM may reflect the distinctive aspects of neural alterations, it is plausible to postulate that the alterations of the ACC in IGD subjects may play a vital role in a dysfunctional interaction between executive control and reward-based decision making. \n\nWe find decreased GMV of SMA in IGD people through VBM analysis. The SMA is capable of controlling internally generated movements and action sequences ( ). Spending more time playing computer games and on repetitive motor actions, such as clicking the mouse or hitting the keyboard, may cause structural changes in the SMA. Just like the cingulate gyrus, the SMA also contributes significantly to cognitive control ( ) such as integrating sensory information and monitoring conflict ( ). A study has shown that disruptions of the SMA can provoke impairments in response inhibition ( ). Besides, during a Go\/No-Go Task, IGD subjects showed decreased activation of the SMA for response inhibition compared with healthy controls in a functional imaging study ( ). We speculate that IGD subjects\u2019 inability to control their urge to play games is associated with a reduction in SMA gray matter involved in response inhibition, consistent with previous evidence that appropriate response inhibition may be a key aspect of impulse control ( ). \n\nThe findings of lower activation of the MFG in IGD subjects cannot be ignored. It is commonly believed that the MFG contributes to inhibitory control ( ,  ,  ). A study ( ) has found that the MFG activation was negatively correlated with the Stroop effect in the IGD groups, which is consistent with previous studies on IGD subjects in go\/no-go task ( ) and switching ( ) task. Hypoactivation in the MFG in IGD subjects probably suggests that they may engage less endeavor in controlling their impulses to play games. \n\nThe precuneus, also known as the posterior region of the medial parietal cortex, plays an important role in fundamental cognitive functions such as episodic memory retrieval, visual-spatial information, spatially guided behavior, and attentional processing ( ). Numerous studies have confirmed that parietal areas are activated during attention-shifting and are activated by visual addiction-related cues when attention is reflexively drawn to salient features of the stimulus ( ). Higher brain activation in precuneus in IGD subjects may indicate that they experience more cognitive conflict and require more top-down attention during the addictive Stroop task ( ,  ). That means, gaming-related words have attracted IGD subjects\u2019 attention during the addiction Stroop task and the precuneus was activated to promote cue-induced cravings for online gaming. \n\nThe fusiform, located in the middle of the ventral temporal lobe, is considered to be one of the most important brain regions in the visual ventral stream and plays an important role in a range of visual cognitive functions, such as the recognition of the face, body and various object features ( \u2013 ), color information processing and emotion perception in facial stimulation ( ). Furthermore, the fusiform topographically connects the striate cortex to the inferior temporal lobe, which is associated with auditory processing, comprehension and verbal memory ( ). We observed significant activation of the fusiform and inferior temporal gyrus, which may indicate that IGD subjects were more focused on the visual and auditory stimuli of games and were reminded of past online gaming experiences, triggering cravings. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, we also found increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) involved in risk-evaluation ( ,  ) and audio-visual information accumulation in decision-making tasks ( ), as well as in the regulation between reward and risk levels ( ,  ). A study by Dong et al. ( ) demonstrated that IGD subjects needed longer time than healthy controls to make decisions and showed greater activation of the inferior frontal gyrus both in WIN and LOSS trials. Another research found that the activation of the IFG had a positive correlation with the risk aversion ( ). We speculate the reason for hyperactivation in IFG is that IGD subjects need more endeavors to complete the decision-making task and may affect executive functions needed to perform other tasks such as conflict inhibition. It could also explain that the occurrence of negative outcomes can lead to further negative reinforcement and the continuation of addictive behaviors to avoid negative effects ( ). \n\n\n## Limitation \n  \nThis meta-analysis sheds new light on brain structure and functional changes of IGD, which may have implications for both clinical interventions and future research. However, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. First, it is difficult to rule out the inter-study heterogeneity of methodologies (including MRI machine, slice thickness, pretreatment protocol, and statistical threshold), which may influence our results. Future research should focus on these issues. Second, the meta-analysis was based primarily on peak coordinates rather than raw statistical brain maps, it may not be sufficient enough to detect some results with small or medium effect sizes ( ,  ). Third, male participants were dominant in all samples, and we did not analyze neurological differences in IGD patients of different genders. Fourth, due to the integration of cross-sectional studies, the causal relationship between the structural and functional brain changes and the development of addiction still requires careful consideration. As a consequence, longitudinal studies should be focused on in future research. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, our pooled meta-analysis found distinctive brain structural and functional alterations in IGD across different modalities. Evidence from brain functional abnormalities and gray-matter volume alteration converged to show that IGD was associated with brain regions involved in executive control, cognitive function, and reward-based decision-making such as the ACC, the SMA, the precuneus, fusiform and the IFG. Meta-regression analysis further explored the association between brain structural alterations in IGD and clinical information. Our findings stress the neurofunctional and neurostructural biomarkers for IGD, which may help to develop effective interventions for these brain regions as potential behavioral, pharmacological or neurotherapeutic targets. Besides, longitudinal studies should be performed to complement and validate our findings in the future. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nXN, MZ, XG, ZY, MY, and YZ conceived and designed the study.

Deficits in working memory are linked to the risk of onset of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, and there is a significant temporal overlap between the peak of first episode psychosis risk and working memory maturation. In order to characterize the normal working memory functional maturation process through this critical phase of cognitive development we conducted a systematic review and coordinate based meta-analyses of all the available primary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0382) that mapped WM function in healthy adolescents (10\u201317 years) and young adults (18\u201330 years). Activation Likelihood Estimation analyses across all WM tasks revealed increased activation with increasing subject age in the middle frontal gyrus (BA6) bilaterally, the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the left precuneus and left inferior parietal gyri (BA7; 40). Decreased activation with increasing age was found in the right superior frontal (BA8), left junction of postcentral and inferior parietal (BA3\/40), and left limbic cingulate gyrus (BA31). These results suggest that brain activation during adolescence increased with age principally in higher order cortices, part of the core working memory network, while reductions were detected in more diffuse and potentially more immature neural networks. Understanding the process by which the brain and its cognitive functions mature through healthy adulthood may provide us with new clues to understanding the vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders. \n   Highlight  \n  \nHealthy working memory functional maturation process in adolescence \n  \nBrain activation increased with age in higher order cortices. \n  \nActivation decreased in more diffuse and potentially more immature networks. \n  \nProvide new clues to understanding vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Rationale \n  \nAdolescence represents a time of both dynamic cognitive development and a period when neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia often first emerge clinically ( ,  ). Late adolescence and early adulthood are periods of active neuronal maturation in higher order integrative cortices such as the superior temporal, posterior parietal, and prefrontal regions ( ) that may underpin age related improvements in cognitive performance ( ). One such cognitive ability is working memory (WM). WM is a temporary holding store for information no longer available in the external environment. Healthy WM functioning is critical for a variety of executive functions ( ), while WM deficits are linked to disorders such as schizophrenia ( ,  ,  ), and meet endophenotypic criteria for that disorder ( ). These links with schizophrenia may be particularly relevant given that the maturation of WM coincides so closely with the time when many patients first develop symptoms of schizophrenia ( ). \n\nTo understand the possible links between WM functional maturation in late adolescence and early adulthood and the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders it is important to first establish the basis for healthy WM development. This has the advantage of circumventing the potentially confounding effects of ill-related factors (e.g. treatment) that make it difficult to interpret results in patients alone. WM performance improves throughout adolescence as subjects employ better executive and rehearsal strategies and improve processing speed ( ,  ). \n\nThere is a body of work that relates to executive functioning, specifically WM in healthy children and the transition period from childhood to adolescence ( ). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of fMRI responses across a range of WM tasks in healthy adults leads to the proposal of a core network, that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal and the inferior and superior parietal cortices ( ,  ). Subcortical structures include anterior insula ( ), basal ganglia ( ), hippocampus ( ), and the cerebellum ( ). However, the transition period of WM development between adolescence and adulthood remains under-researched and it is not currently well mapped. Regarding WM development, much of the \u2018mature\u2019 circuitry is \u2018functionally\u2019 in place by middle childhood but continues to refine as the child gets older ( ), though this process remains unclear. Evidence shows that WM development is linked to a shift from visuospatial or motor network activation toward executive network activation with increasing age ( ,  ,  ). However, more contradictory results have been found for executive network activation and task-related responses. For example, WM development has been linked both to increased ( ) and decreased executive network activation and continued refinement of fronto-parietal regions with age ( ,  ,  ). Similarly, it has been associated with enhanced sustained and diminished task-related response ( ), but also the opposite ( ,  ). One review proposed that WM development first involved an integration of childhood compensatory network with the more mature performance enhancing regions, and then a greater degree of localisation within those regions ( ). \n\n\n### Objectives \n  \nTaken together, these data suggest that WM related neural activation patterns change through adolescence although the timing, site, and manner of those changes remain unclear. To address these questions we performed a coordinate based meta-analysis that integrated the results of all available fMRI neuroimaging studies that investigated WM function with age in healthy adolescents and young adults from a systematic review of the literature. We decided to adopt a broad and inclusive rather than overly focused age window for the analyses, because the timing of normal development and cortical maturation is itself indistinct. This strategy allowed us to map activity across a broad range of ages and developmental time frames. Due to a lack of longitudinal studies, we solely included studies containing a cross sectional design that maps WM as a function of increasing age. Pooling data from multiple studies provides an opportunity to address some of neuroimaging's traditional problems such as small sample size and study-specific \u2018noise\u2019. We chose the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method that offers a well-established process for quantitative voxel wise random effects meta-analysis ( ,  ,  ). Based on the available literature, we hypothesized that the meta-analysis would primarily reveal an increase of activation in higher order integrative cortices, or association areas linked to the fully matured core WM network and a decrease in activation in ancillary brain regions, that might serve a less mature WM network. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Protocol and registration \n  \nWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses ( ) method. \n\n\n### Information source and search \n  \nWe first searched peer-reviewed papers published in English through MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library, including all potential articles from inception to July 2014. The following search terms were used: \u2018Working Memory\u2019 and \u2018healthy adolescence\/adolescents\/developmental trajectories\u2019 and \u201cneuroimaging\/fMRI\u201d. The search was conducted without any language restrictions. Other reviews and articles were hand searched for relevant studies not identified from the computerized literature search. Authors were contacted for further co-ordinate information where necessary. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nThe following inclusion criteria were used: (a) Participants were healthy adolescents (age: 10\u201317 years) and adults (age: 18\u201330 years) (b) participants' age was provided as either an independent continuous or categorical variable (c) WM studies used a within or between-subject design (d) WM performance was indexed by a quantitative, well validated and reliable WM measurement, respectively a form of n-back task ( ) or delayed matching to sample task ( ) (e) WM studies contrasted the WM task with a resting baseline (passive) or a sensory-motor (active) control condition that did not include a WM component (f) used fMRI with a voxel based approach, and (h) reported results as stereotactic coordinates in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute space. \n\n\n### Data collection process \n  \nTwo reviewers (JAA, RZ) screened and assessed the studies returned from the search using the above criteria. Both reviewers independently extracted and analyzed the data from the included papers. \n\n\n### Publication Bias and coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nPublication-trends and biases in neuroimaging literature can affect ALE-analysis as the inclusion of a particular coordinate is conditioned on the fact that significant findings are prioritized for publication ( ). However, coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis differs from most other forms of meta-analyses by assessing the spatial convergence between reported coordinates rather than quantifying the pooled effect sizes, which may be biased by non-published small effects and published type I error in small samples. Thus including an estimated number of unpublished results would not have any impact on the assessment of spatial convergence performed by ALE. The result is that a coordinate based rather than effect size, meta-analysis should be less susceptible to publication bias, while still acknowledging them as a quantitative integration of the available data ( ). \n\n\n### Outcome measures \n  \nWe categorized the WM tasks on the basis of the experimental paradigm used. We focused on two commonly used tasks the n-back and delayed matching-to-sample task. In the n-back, stimuli are presented consecutively, at each stimulus the participant is asked to identify whether the current stimulus is the same as the previous (1-back) or the second to last (2-back) etc. In delayed matching-to-sample task a single stimulus (the sample) is presented, after a variable delay the participant has to identify the sample from a set of distractors. Examples of this task include the \u201cSternberg task\u201d ( ) and the oculomotor delayed-response task ( ). Within these two major experimental paradigms, tasks differed in a number of ways, but principally by the means of presentation, usually aural or visual, the nature of the stimuli e.g. letters, numbers, words or the property to be remembered e.g. location or identity. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic approach \n  \nALE is a robust method of quantitative meta-analysis of fMRI data implemented in \u201cGingerALE 2.3.2\u201d ( ). Coordinates, reported in, either Talairach or MNI standard space of each significant peak for all eligible subjects constituted the input to the meta-analyses ( ). Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates were converted to Talairach space using the validated icbm2tal transformation ( ). Only one contrast was reported per study to ensure statistical independence. \n\nFoci were restricted to the reported contrast between the experimental WM task with either resting baseline or a sensory-motor control. Age was coded as an independent variable. Two principle-analyses were conducted; firstly we looked at overall WM performance (visuospatial and verbal WM tasks together) as the dependent variable. Secondly we repeated the analyses but separately for visuospatial and verbal WM. Thus, in total six separate meta-analyses were conducted; three that identified areas where activation increased with increasing subject age and three where activation decreased with increasing age for each of overall WM, visuospatial WM, and verbal WM. Each activation focus from each study was modeled as the centre of Gaussian probability distribution with full width half-maxima of 10\u00a0mm . These were subsequently summed to create a statistical map that estimated the likelihood of activation for each voxel from the entire set of studies. After combining the probabilities, a critical significant ALE score threshold was determined; the ALE maps were thresholded at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 using a non-parametric False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction with a threshold of pN\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Statistical significance was determined using a permutation test (=\u00a05000) of randomly created foci and clusters below a volume of 100\u00a0mm  were excluded. ALE results were overlaid onto an optimized individual anatomical T1-template ( ) and cluster centers were anatomically located in Mango ( ) ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search \n  \nAfter removing duplicates, the initial search returned 173 articles that were screened by title and abstract and 130 articles were immediately excluded. After more detailed screening of the remaining 43 articles, 20 met inclusion criteria. A full-text assessment excluded a further ten because (1) ALE compatible coordinates were not available despite efforts to contact the authors directly; or (2) used region of interest analyses; or (3) did not provide age as an independent continuous or dichotomous variable, or (4) contained only load rather than task effects. There were no available studies with within-subject design. Thus only studies with between-subject design were included. In total ten articles fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and proceeded to the meta-analysis. See  . \n\n\n### Study and sample characteristics \n  \nOf the ten studies included in the meta-analysis, six assessed visuospatial WM, one focused on visual WM only, one on verbal WM only, and two on both visuospatial WM and verbal WM. Five of the studies treated age as a continuous variable. The remaining studies as categorical variable with arbitrarily defined ranges (e.g. 13\u201317 and 18\u201330; 11\u201315 and 20\u201328; 9\u201313 and 18\u201323). Nine of the ten studies that included data from 218 subjects, identified 60 foci of increased brain activation, while six studies, that included data on 164 subjects reported 22 foci that showed decreased brain activation (See  ). \n\n\n### Regions of increased brain activation with age \n  \nNine studies of overall WM function identified increased brain activation in 60 foci that were restricted to five distinct brain regions when minimum cluster size criteria were applied, during WM tasks with increasing age. These were the middle frontal cortex bilaterally (Brodmann area: BA6); left precuneus (BA7); left parieto-temporal cortex, the inferior parietal gyrus (BA40); and left middle frontal cortex (BA10). \n\nSeven studies reported on visuospatial WM and identified 39 foci, of which two, the right middle frontal cortex (BA6) and the left precuneus (BA7), exceeded minimum cluster volume. No cluster for verbal WM exceeded the minimum volume of >\u00a0100\u00a0mm  (See   and  ). \n\n\n### Regions of decreased brain activation with age \n  \nSix experiments identified decreased brain activation with increasing age in overall WM performance in 22 foci in three distinct brain regions; the right superior frontal gyrus including the frontal eye field (BA8), the left junction of the postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal (BA3\/40), and left cingulate gyrus (BA31). \n\nWhen restricted to visuospatial WM, five experiments of 110 subjects identified 17 foci. Only one region exceeded the minimum cluster size; the right inferior parietal lobe (BA40). No cluster for verbal WM exceeded the minimum volume. See   and   for detailed information. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this meta-analysis of all the available fMRI data we set out to assess the developmental changes that take place in WM functional circuits during adolescence and early adulthood. We found that there were no suitable longitudinal studies available and that within cross sectional designs, cognitive development appeared to be supported by increases in brain activation in key WM nodes and activation decreases in others. This is in line with previous developmental work that found both hypo- and hyper activation in adolescents relative to adults in regions significantly important in executive functioning and, therefore, providing evidence for the varied nature of not yet fully developed processes. Age-related increases in activation are interpreted as enhanced maturity in accessing performance-enhancing regions, whereas decreases in responses with age are viewed as indicating that a specific circuitry is no longer needed with age ( ,  ,  ). \n\n### Increased brain activation with age \n  \n#### Fronto-parietal network \n  \nWithin the frontal lobes, the middle frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA6) showed increased activation with increasing subject age. This is consistent with earlier meta-analyses that identified this area as a region in the core WM network in healthy adults ( ,  ,  ). The middle frontal gyrus has a critical role to the execution of complex motor responses ( ) and though frequently implicated, its role in more overt cognitive tasks is less well understood ( ,  ). Specifically, during cognitive tasks BA6 involvement has often been conceptualized as a concomitant latent motor process ( ). It may be that the middle frontal gyrus is involved in higher-level control processes critical to motor self-control ( ). The majority of WM tasks in this meta-analysis required the participants to make a motor response, typically a button push. That process required planning and response inhibition of motor activity that may develop in line with increased activation in BA6 with increasing subject age. \n\nActivation in the left anterior middle prefrontal cortex (BA10) increased with increasing subject age. This region is linked to a monitoring and control function. The BA10 may support cognitive shifting between maintenance or updating and selection, manipulation, or monitoring functions, optimizing efficiency and task performance. This brain region may thus play a role in goal or process learning and selection rather than data processing in memory per se ( ). A complimentary view is that the anterior middle prefrontal cortex supports the coordination of information processing and transfer between the multiple cognitive operations within WM ( ). Based on this view we propose that the increased activation in the BA10 with age is linked in broad terms to the maturation of strategic processing. \n\nActivation in the left inferior parietal lobe (BA40) and left precuneus (BA7) increased with increasing age. Both regions are frequently implicated in WM studies ( ) and in rule-guided conditional reasoning operations, that require the application of a wide range of cognitive resources to the maintenance of WM ( ,  ). Furthermore, the BA7 might be related to the representation and manipulation of spatial relations among different object features. ( ). In addition, consistent with the complex nature of the WM tasks in this meta-analysis, increased activation in parietal areas (BA40, BA7) with increasing age might be explained by the fact that the inferior parietal cortex also plays an important role in enhanced domain-general executive processes such as rapid switching of attention ( ). This is in line with a review that suggests that shifting attention may be a component of many executive processes involved in the control of WM. Thus, maintaining information in WM while processing other information, manipulating information in WM, and selecting which information among several sources should be stored in WM are all relatively complex processes that require shifting among both perceptual items and those stored in WM ( ). \n\nComplimentary data suggest links between improving WM performance and structural indices in the fronto-parietal cortex. For example greater white matter integrity in superior fronto-parietal regions, adjacent to cortical regions implicated in WM have been associated with better WM performance ( ,  ). Similarly, a multi-modal diffusion tensor imaging and fMRI study found that the degree of white matter maturation is positively correlated with brain activity in superior fronto and intraparietal cortex, which contribute to the WM functional network ( ). \n\nOur meta-analysis identified regions in the core adult WM network where activation increased with age from adolescence to adulthood ( ). It is likely that the increased activation with age in the middle frontal cortex (BA6), anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10), and left inferior parietal lobe and left precuneus (BA40\u00a0+\u00a0BA7) is indicative of the progressive recruitment of these task related frontal and parietal regions that underpin the functional maturation of the adult WM network ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n\n### Decreased brain activation with age \n  \n#### Fronto-parietal network and limbic lobe \n  \nBesides its role in eye movement, the posterior dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (BA8) contributes to the conditional allocation of attention to competing environmental stimuli ( ). Related to the maintenance of visuospatial attention during WM, it has been suggested that the activity in this region particularly plays an important role were delays are imposed between a stimulus and a response to that stimulus ( ). One possible explanation for the reduced brain activation in BA8 with increasing participant age might be that this region is strongly associated with maintenance. For it has been suggested that younger participants might be more sensitive in the delay phase relying more on BA8 compared to older participants ( ). \n\nThe left junction of the postcentral and inferior parietal gyrus (BA3\/40) supports complex linguistic processes, especially attention to phonological relations ( ,  ). Many of the WM paradigms included in these meta-analyses used letters and the participants might have used active verbal rehearsal strategies to follow rules and keep the information active in the WM store to enhance optimal task performance ( ). Furthermore, the decrease in activation as subjects aged, and as cognitive strategies matured, could be interpreted as that participants became less reliant on visual analysis processing ( ). \n\nActivation in the left posterior cingulate gyrus (BA31) was reduced with age. While the region is highly functionally connected there is no consensus about its cognitive role ( ) and it is not implicated in the core WM network in healthy adults ( ,  ). One possible explanation is that the posterior cingulate is active in the default mode network. The default network mode is rapidly deactivated during a variety of externally directed tasks and when attention is focussed in for example a WM task ( ). Its role has been linked to monitoring change and facilitating shifts in behavior, where low activity is linked to continued operation with the prevailing cognitive set, and increases with investigation, exploration, flexibility and new learning ( ). It might be that younger subjects experience greater novelty with WM tasks compared to older subjects. \n\nThe significance of local reductions in brain activation with increasing age remains a subject of conjecture. The three regions identified by this meta-analysis, the caudal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA8), the junction of the postcentral and inferior parietal gyrus (BA3\/40), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (BA31) are not implicated in the core WM network in healthy adults ( ,  ). It is possible that these regions form part of a compensatory network that supports the still maturing WM network. With increasing age WM performance increases, the underpinning WM network becomes more refined and there is less need to activate the compensatory network ( ). Supporting evidence comes from a region of interest study that investigated the cross-sectional changes in functional WM brain circuitry from childhood to adulthood. Its results support the hypothesis that younger subjects rely primarily on a more ventromedial network including the caudate nucleus and anterior insula and less on the core adult WM regions such as the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal region (i.e. supramarginal gyrus). As subjects age the WM network matures by integrating premotor response preparation and executive circuitry into a specialized refined core WM network ( ). \n\n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nOur meta-analysis has a number of limitations. The first and most important was the lack of suitable within-subject longitudinal studies. Therefore, we solely included studies with a between-subject design. In order to speak about true maturational processes, there is an immediate need for future research to deploy longitudinal designs in neurodevelopmental informative healthy and high-risk populations, to address this research gap. Secondly, we included data from two classes of experimental paradigm; the n-back task and delayed matching-to-sample tasks. These differed according to task subtype, control task, memory modality and stimulus types. By including data from such a diverse group of experiments there might be confounding brain activation related to dissimilar underlying processes and strategies involved during the separate WM tasks. Future meta-analyses with access to greater number of studies over time should focus both on single experimental paradigms that specify the underlying WM processes such as encoding, maintenance or manipulation of stimuli. To eliminate performance related variation in brain activity, some cross-sectional studies used simple tasks or grouped subjects based on individual performance. However, this approach leaves certain critical cognitive operations untapped, which might lead to biases in the investigation of the true higher order cortices development. Indeed, a recent paper suggested that chronological age might be too limited an index to measure relevant developmental changes in brain function and suggested \u201cfunctional age\u201d as an alternative ( ). The fourth limitation was linked to how subjects' chronological age was characterized. Some studies treated age as a continuous and others as a categorical variable, e.g. \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cadolescents\u201d. This creates several problems. Firstly the definition of age categories often differed between studies, with no commonality of definition. Secondly, by collapsing into categories, researchers lose data richness and the ability to precisely track developmental changes over time. Finally using age as a continuous variable facilitates comparisons between studies Thus, we conclude that age should be dealt with as a continuous variable in future studies. Another limitation is related to the gender-ratios of the included studies. A recent coordinate based meta-analysis explored the effects of gender on the functional WM network and found common elements but also differences between the genders. Specifically, females tended to activate more limbic (amygdala and hippocampus) and prefrontal structures (right inferior frontal gyrus), while males activated a distributed network including more parietal components ( ). Future work needs to pay attention to this effect and incorporate it at the study design and analytic stage. Lastly, based on our exploratory approach, we only included between-subject voxel-based studies to avoid a user bias in defining the regions of interest and therefore excluded studies that used region of interest methods. The next step will be a confirmation of brain regions that showed an increase and decrease in activation based on the voxel based design. This should preferably be done in a longitudinal study using the region of interest method. \n\n\n### Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders \n  \nAdolescence is a time of substantial concomitant refinement of cognitive processes and physical maturation of neural circuitry underlying cognitions, such as WM. These changes are usually beneficial and optimize the brain for the challenges ahead, but they can also confer a vulnerability to certain types of psychopathology, such as schizophrenia ( ). Overall, WM deficit is a trait characteristic of schizophrenia present across a range of clinical stages, notably from initial vulnerability to the chronic state ( ). Understanding the basis of schizophrenia therefore requires a comprehensive knowledge of how the brain is put together. Since the adolescent brain is in a state of flux it may be possible to stabilize the adolescent brain of those at risks so that any disruption is only transitory and so that chronic schizophrenia does not emerge ( ). Specifically, neuroimaging data can help in the development of neuroanatomical models of, for example, cognitive processes that are based on findings from developmental psychology. Therefore, imaging studies of healthy adolescents are very important to help us construct age appropriate structural and functional brain templates. Because both common genetic and environmental risk factors affect healthy subjects as well as patients, studies using healthy participants can often avoid the confounders associated with manifest illness and offer the hope to identify mechanisms that lie before the emergence of illness ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current meta-analysis of healthy children and adolescents confirmed late maturational changes in activation in WM-associated regions. Evidence of activation increases was found in performance-enhancing fronto-parietal higher order cortices part of the core WM network. Furthermore, decreases in compensatory or supportive brain regions were also seen. Given that adolescence is a vulnerable period in which the initial symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders tend to manifest, it is paramount to establish a robust understanding of the healthy functional development of WM. On the basis of this, abnormalities could be detected both faster and with greater certainty. Ideally, this paper will kindle further scientific inquiry into healthy neural circuitry development, explored through key cognitive paradigms such as WM, and thus, move a step closer to the earlier detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. Such detection is likely to contribute to more effective intervention strategies and ultimately, better health outcomes for our patients. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5153561,"text_md5":"8ccf195933551b4a139854751fa8f742","field_positions":{"authors":[0,77],"journal":[78,93],"publication_year":[95,99],"title":[110,226],"keywords":[240,337],"abstract":[350,2277],"body":[2286,30308]},"batch":1,"pmid":27995059,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2015.12.002","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5153561","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5153561"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5153561\">5153561<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5153561  Working memory circuit as a function of increasing age in healthy adolescence: A systematic review and meta-analyses"}
{"text":"Qiu, Zeguo and Lei, Xue and Becker, Stefanie I. and Pegna, Alan J.\nBrain Imaging Behav, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nNeural activities during the Processing of unattended and unseen emotional faces: a voxel-wise Meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nVisual awareness\nUnconscious processing\nEmotional faces\nfMRI\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nVoxel-wise meta-analyses of task-evoked regional activity were conducted for healthy individuals during the unconscious processing of emotional and neutral faces with an aim to examine whether and how different experimental paradigms influenced brain activation patterns. Studies were categorized into sensory and attentional unawareness paradigms. Thirty-four fMRI studies including 883 healthy participants were identified. Across experimental paradigms, unaware emotional faces elicited stronger activation of the limbic system, striatum, inferior frontal gyrus, insula and the temporal lobe, compared to unaware neutral faces. Crucially, in attentional unawareness paradigms, unattended emotional faces elicited a right-lateralized increased activation (i.e., right amygdala, right temporal pole), suggesting a right hemisphere dominance for processing emotional faces during inattention. By contrast, in sensory unawareness paradigms, unseen emotional faces elicited increased activation of the left striatum, the left amygdala and the right middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, across paradigms, unconsciously processed positive emotions were found associated with more activation in temporal and parietal cortices whereas unconsciously processed negative emotions elicited stronger activation in subcortical regions, compared to neutral faces. \n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s11682-022-00697-8. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEmotional human faces are important in our daily life. Negative emotions like fearful and angry expressions tend to indicate potential threat in our surroundings (Fox et al.,  ; Phelps et al.,  ), and positive emotions like happy faces play a crucial role in social interactions (Beaudry et al.,  ; Wirth & Wentura,  ). Moreover, a processing bias is observed towards emotional faces, even when the faces are presented below our awareness threshold (e.g., Del Zotto & Pegna,  ; Pegna et al.,  ). \n\nBrain imaging techniques, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have been widely used to reveal the neural networks involved in unconscious processing of emotional faces. Emotional faces processed implicitly, as opposed to explicitly, have been found to activate the amygdala, the insula, and fronto-occipital areas more strongly than neutral faces (for a review see Tao et al.,  ). Activations of these regions have been suggested to be important for the neural representation of (LeDoux,  ), and emotional reactivity to (Gruber et al.,  ), emotional information without visual awareness. In particular, negative emotions such as fear can be conveyed through a subcortical pathway that runs in parallel to the cortical, geniculo-striate route (Compton,  ; LeDoux,  ; Tamietto & De Gelder,  ). The amygdala, a target region for this subcortical pathway, has been found to be sensitive to the emotional expression of faces, even when the faces are not consciously processed (Diano et al.,  ; Whalen et al.,  ). Convergent evidence was obtained from studies on patients with brain lesions. Indeed, patients suffering from cortical blindness following lesions of their primary visual cortex have been reported to guess emotional expressions of faces at an above-chance level, a phenomenon termed affective blindsight (De Gelder et al.,  ). Importantly, in affective blindsight, emotional faces were found to activate the right amygdala (Burra et al.,  ; Pegna et al.,  ). The absence of the primary visual cortex suggested that threat-related signals like fear must reach the amygdala through a subcortical pathway (i.e., the colliculus-pulvinar-subcortical pathway; LeDoux,  ; M\u00e9ndez-B\u00e9rtolo et al.,  ). \n\nIn heathy individuals, unconscious processing of emotional faces is mainly examined with two broad types of experimental paradigms. In   sensory unawareness   paradigms, stimuli are rendered invisible to the participants either by backward masking or interocular suppression. In   attentional unawareness   paradigms, stimuli are rendered irrelevant to participants\u2019 experimental task and hence are unattended (e.g., Diano et al.,  ). While attentional unawareness encompasses active attentional suppression over the stimuli presented, sensory unawareness is achieved by making stimuli undetectable at the perceptual level. Findings on the underlying neural mechanisms of these paradigms are inconclusive with mixed results reported across different paradigms and sometimes within a same category of paradigms. \n\nIn sensory unawareness paradigms, some researchers found increased activation of the amygdala and a wide range of cortical regions for unseen emotional faces, compared to unseen neutral faces (e.g., Chen et al.,  ; Dannlowski et al.,  ). However, others found that unseen emotional faces elicited stronger activity only in cortical regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex; Duval et al.,  ). Several studies even found no differences in activation between unseen emotional and neutral faces (e.g., Amting et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). \n\nSimilar to certain sensory unawareness findings, attentional unawareness paradigms found stronger activations in frontal and temporal areas (e.g., Holtmann et al.,  ; Vuilleumier et al.,  ) and the amygdala (e.g., Schulte Holthausen et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ) for unattended emotional compared to neutral faces. Additional subcortical regions including the thalamus and the striatum showed stronger activity to unattended emotional compared to neutral faces (e.g., Holtmann et al.,  ). Moreover, reduced activity in V5 and occipital regions were reported for unattended emotional compared to neutral faces (Attar et al.,  ; Holtmann et al.,  ). \n\nConsidering the similarities and noticeable differences between the findings from different experimental paradigms, a systematic examination is needed to compare brain activation patterns between unseen and unattended emotional faces. In a previous meta-analysis, Shi et al. ( ) compared the activation patterns between two types of paradigms for implicitly processed faces. They found that inattention tasks were associated with increased activation of more cortical regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus) than masking experiments when emotional faces were compared to neutral ones (Shi et al.,  ). The activation of cortical regions by inattention tasks, especially regions in the dorsal attention network (i.e., precuneus), was interpreted as evidence that inattention tasks are associated with a later stage of face processing, which activates the dorsal attention network (Shi et al.,  ). \n\nWhile these findings are important, this previous meta-analysis did not provide clear and direct examinations on unconscious processing of emotion. Instead, unconscious processing was treated in the same manner as implicit processing (Shi et al.,  ). For example, studies where participants were instructed to judge the gender or age of the faces were considered as a type of implicit processing of the emotion and were included in the analysis. However, given that the faces were still task-relevant and had to be attended, it is unclear to what extent emotion was indeed unattended and suppressed from awareness. Therefore, while previous results using inattention paradigms revealed the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of   task-irrelevant emotions  , it is not known whether these findings would apply if the faces themselves were unattended (i.e.,   task-irrelevant faces  ). A more focused investigation of unconscious processing should therefore examine unattended faces, rather than unattended emotions. \n\nIn addition to the effects caused by dissimilarities in experimental settings, different neural networks may be involved in processing emotions of different valences. Some behavioral research has found that happy faces can be recognized more accurately than other emotions including fear, anger, sadness and disgust when presented very briefly (e.g., 25\u00a0ms; Calvo & Lundqvist,  ). However, an EEG study found that, when compared to happy faces, fearful faces enhanced the amplitude of an early electrophysiological marker related to visual processing (i.e., C1; Zhu & Luo,  ). Using neuroimaging to directly compare the regions activated by unconsciously processed happy and sad faces, Juruena et al. ( ) found that the amygdala and hippocampus were more strongly activated by masked happy faces compared to masked sad faces. Other neuroimaging studies found similar results when comparing unaware positive or negative emotions against a neutral face (e.g., Faivre et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ). Therefore, while both positive and negative emotions can be processed without awareness, there are some inconsistencies in whether the two categories are similarly prioritized during visual processing. Specifically, it remains unknown how the unconscious processing of positive and negative emotions differ regarding their underlying neural networks. \n\nThe current meta-analysis aimed to examine systematically the previous findings on unconscious processing of emotional faces by first comparing brain activation patterns between unaware emotional and neutral faces across all experimental paradigms. We then compared brain activation patterns associated with sensory unawareness (i.e., masking and binocular rivalry) and attentional unawareness paradigms (i.e., inattention tasks). Lastly, we examined whether positive emotions (e.g., happy faces) and negative emotions (e.g., fearful, angry, sad and disgusted faces) were associated with different brain activation patterns without visual awareness. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nWe searched Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science for articles published in English before August 16th, 2021, using the following terms and their derivatives: \u201cfMRI\u201d; AND \u201cmasking\u201d OR \u201cinattention\u201d OR \u201cdual task\u201d OR \u201cbinocular rivalry\u201d OR \u201ccontinuous flash suppression\u201d OR \u201cunconscious\u201d OR \u201csubliminal\u201d OR \u201cpriming OR \u201cattentional blink\u201d; AND \u201cemotional\u201d OR \u201cthreatening\u201d OR \u201cfaces\u201d. The reference lists of relevant review and meta-analysis articles were also examined to include additional papers. \n\nA study was included if it: (1) was published in English, in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) used fMRI; (3) included healthy human participants; (4) compared neural activation between emotional faces and neutral faces in conditions where participants were not aware of the stimuli; (5) conducted whole-brain analyses in the form of three-dimensional coordinates in standard stereotactic coordinate space (i.e., Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach). \n\nA study was excluded if it: (1) used the same data as other included studies; (2) investigated connectivity or used diffusion tensor imaging; (3) was a resting-state fMRI study. \n\nIn the current meta-analysis, we only included studies where the faces were unattended (i.e., excluding situations where non-emotional aspects of the faces, such as gender, were still attended). Also, we only included studies that contrasted emotional faces against neutral faces to obtain emotion-specific results. \n\nQuality assessment of each study included was conducted with a 7-point checklist (supplementary Table  ). Information including image acquisition techniques were presented in the Table  . The current study was performed according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (Stroup et al.,  ). See Fig.\u00a0  for the PRISMA Flow Diagram on the study selection for this meta-analysis.\n   \nPRISMA Flow Diagram of Study Selection \n  \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nWe used the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) software package (version 6.21;  ) to perform meta-analyses on the different neural activation patterns for unaware emotional faces and unaware neutral faces. The SDM-PSI method allows the combination of statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates originally reported in individual studies (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). By using multiple imputation and the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) statistics, the SDM-PSI provides a less biased estimation of the population effect size (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ; Bossier et al.,  ). \n\nBriefly, we first extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes (e.g.,   t   values,   z   values) of the different hemodynamic activity between unaware emotional and unaware neutral faces from each individual study.   Z   scores reported as effect sizes were converted to   t  -values using an online converter ( ). Second, the maps of lower and upper bounds of the effect sizes for all voxels were estimated using an anisotropic Gaussian kernel, which improves the plausibility of the maps by allocating different values to distinct voxels of a peak dependent on relevant spatial correlations. To control for false-positive results, the default kernel size (full anisotropy\u2009=\u20091) and thresholds were used (full width at half maximum [FWHM]\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm and voxel\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm; see Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ; Radua et al.,  ). Third, the most likely effect size and the corresponding standard error were estimated using multiple imputations (50 imputations) of a random-effects general linear model to create the mean map (Bossier et al.,  ; Radua et al.,  ). Finally, common permutation tests (1000 permutations) were used to perform family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons in combination with a TFCE in statistical thresholding (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05 and cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels). As a result, the included studies were weighted differentially based on their sample sizes, between-study heterogeneities and intra-study variances, increasing the contributions of the studies with smaller variance or larger sample size (Radua & Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nWe contrasted emotional faces, either rendered unseen (by masking or binocular rivalry) or unattended (by inattention), to unseen or unattended neutral faces. \n\nTwenty-four out of 34 studies described their measurements on participants\u2019 awareness of the stimuli in the papers and analyzed data only from participants who reported no awareness of the stimuli. We ran an additional analysis using data from this subgroup across experimental paradigms. Because the results from this additional analysis (Table  ) remained largely the same as the analysis using all available datasets, below we report the results from all 34 datasets to provide a more comprehensive examinations of the effects of interest. \n\n\n#### Subgroup analyses \n  \nTo investigate the activation patterns associated with different experimental paradigms, we separated the datasets into unseen (masking or binocular rivalry) and unattended (inattention) subgroups and conducted meta-analytic comparisons between unaware emotional and neutral faces separately for the two groups. \n\nTo investigate the activation patterns associated with different emotions, we separated the datasets into positive emotion and negative emotion groups and conducted meta-analytic positive-neutral and negative-neutral comparisons separately. \n\n\n#### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nWe assessed the replicability of the results by conducting a systematic whole-brain voxel-based Jackknife sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we repeated the main statistical analysis while removing one study each time (Radua & Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\n\n#### Analyses of heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nWe performed the   I   statistics heterogeneity analysis to investigate unexplained between-study variability with   I  \u2009<\u200950% indicating low heterogeneity (Higgins et al.,  ), and the Egger\u2019s test to examine potential publication bias in our findings with a significant test result indicating potential publication bias (Radua et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe literature search yielded 752 publications in the databases. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 studies (comprising 883 healthy participants) were ultimately identified as suitable for the current meta-analysis, including 26 datasets from sensory unawareness paradigms (733 healthy participants) and 8 datasets from attentional unawareness paradigms (150 healthy participants). Among the included studies, 13 studies provided data on the contrast between positive and neutral face stimuli and 30 studies provided data on the contrast between negative and neutral face stimuli. Information about sample characteristics and the experimental paradigms of the included studies was shown in Table\u00a0 .\n   \nDemographic and experimental information of the studies included in this meta-analysis \n  \nA supplementary discussion on low-level confounds can be found in  .   Abbreviations  : NA, not available. \n  \n\nAcross all experimental paradigms, compared to unaware neutral faces, unaware emotional faces showed increased activation in the left striatum (BA 48), extending to the left amygdala (BAs 28, 34, 36), left hippocampus (BAs 28, 34, 35), left parahippocampal gyrus (BAs 28, 36), left rolandic operculum and insula (BA 48), left Heschl\u2019s gyrus (BA 48), left temporal pole (BAs 34, 38) and superior temporal gyrus (STG; BAs 41, 48), left pons and left olfactory cortex (BA 48). Three additional significant clusters consisting of the right STG (BAs 21, 22) and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG; BAs 21, 22), the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; BAs 45, 47, 48) extending to the left insula (BAs 47, 48), and the right amygdala (BA 34) extending to the right temporal pole (BA 38) and right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28) were more strongly activated by unaware emotional compared to neutral faces.

SDM, seed-based   d   mapping \n  \n\nA subgroup analysis on datasets from sensory unawareness paradigms showed that, compared to unseen neutral faces, unseen emotional faces elicited increased activation in the left striatum (BA 48), extending to the left amygdala (BAs 28, 34, 36), left hippocampus (BAs 28, 34, 35), left rolandic operculum and insula (BA 48), left Heschl\u2019s gyrus (BA 48) and STG (BAs 41, 48), left pons and left olfactory cortex (BA 48). Another significant cluster consisting of the right MTG (BAs 21, 22) extending to the right STG (BAs 21, 22) was also more strongly activated by unseen emotional compared to neutral faces. \n\nA subgroup analysis on datasets from attentional unawareness paradigms showed that unattended emotional faces elicited increased activation of the right temporal pole (BA 38), extending to the right amygdala (BAs 28, 34), right hippocampus (BA 34), right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 28) and right striatum, compared to unattended neutral faces. Additionally, unattended emotional faces showed increased activation of the right MTG and STG (BAs 21, 22), compared to unattended neutral faces. Detailed results were presented in Table\u00a0  and Fig.  .\n   \nMeta-analysis results regarding regional differences of task-evoked activation between unaware emotional faces and unaware neutral faces in studies using masking or binocular rivalry (unseen stimuli) and studies using inattention paradigms (unattended stimuli) \n  \n BA   Brodmann area,   R   right,   L   left. \n  \n\nA subgroup analysis on datasets on positive emotions showed that, unaware faces with positive emotions (e.g., happy faces) elicited increased activation of the right Heschl\u2019s gyrus (BA 48), extending to the right rolandic operculum (BA 48), right STG (BAs 22, 42, 48), right MTG (BAs 21, 22) and right supramarginal gyrus (BAs 42, 48), compared to unaware neutral faces. A subgroup analysis on datasets on negative emotions showed that unaware negative faces (e.g., fearful and angry faces) elicited increased activation in the left striatum (BA 48), extending to the left amygdala (BA 34) and left pons, compared to unaware neutral faces. Detailed results were presented in Table\u00a0  and Fig.  .\n   \nMeta-analysis results regarding regional differences of task-evoked activation between unaware faces with positive or negative emotions and unaware neutral faces \n  \n BA   Brodmann area,   R   right,   L   left. \n  \n\nEmotional faces did not show any significant reduced activation, compared to neutral faces, in any of the analyses conducted. \n\nThe findings described above remained largely unchanged under the jackknife sensitivity analysis, indicating high robustness of the results (Tables\u00a0 ,  ,  ). The   I   statistics from the heterogeneity analysis showed that all reported regions had low unexplained between-study variabilities (i.e.,   I  \u2009<\u200950%). The Egger\u2019s tests showed no evidence of publication bias for all the reported regions. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Unaware emotional vs neutral faces across paradigms \n  \nAcross all experimental paradigms, unaware emotional faces could be distinguished from unaware neutral faces by engaging subcortical regions (e.g., amygdala and striatum) and limbic areas (e.g., hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). This finding is consistent with the extensive literature on emotion processing. Previous research has found that emotional information including fearful, angry and happy faces is associated with stronger activation of the amygdala and hippocampus, compared to a neutral counterpart, during nonconscious visual processing (for reviews see Diano et al.,  ; Phelps & LeDoux,  ). Similarly, in studies of persons with blindsight, emotional expressions were found to activate the amygdala even when these patients were cortically blind and thus unaware of the presence of visual stimuli (Pegna et al.,  ; Tamietto & De Gelder,  ). As mentioned in the Introduction, a subcortical colliculus-pulvinar-amygdala pathway has been suggested to be necessary for unconscious emotion processing (Morris et al.,  ; Kragel et al.,  ; LeDoux,  ,  ; M\u00e9ndez-B\u00e9rtolo et al.,  ). This is particularly striking for patients who are deprived of primary visual cortices but show affective blindsight (Morris et al.,  ). For these patients, it has been posited that emotional and threat-related signals may reach the amygdala through this alternate route, bypassing the geniculo-striate path, which enables reflexive responses to potential threats in our environment (Morris et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, the existence of such a pathway has been contested. Indeed, some researchers argue that cortical responses rather than subcortical pathways may account for unconscious emotion processing (Cauchoix & Crouzet,  ; Pessoa & Adolphs,  ; Palermo & Rhodes,  ; Sanchez-Lopez et al.,  ). Additionally, it has been argued that intact projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus to extrastriate areas, which also bypasses V1, may subserve blindsight in humans (Ajina & Bridge,  ; Ajina et al.,  ; Smits et al.,  ). Thus, it remains open to debate whether and to what extent unconscious emotion processing is subserved by the subcortical pathway that targets the amygdala. Although our meta-analysis reveals that the amygdala is more strongly activated for emotional relative to neutral faces when visual awareness is restricted, the pathways leading to this activation cannot be determined without further investigations. \n\nInterestingly, the amygdala and the striatum have been found to be actively involved in the striatal dopaminergic system, which has been implicated in the processing of negative emotions (Badgaiyan,  ; Sprengelmeyer et al.,  ). For example, increased release of dopamine at the dorsal striatum was found in response to negative emotions (Badgaiyan,  ). \n\nTaken together, in line with the findings reported in blindsight patients (e.g., Pegna et al.,  ; Tamietto & De Gelder,  ), our current meta-analysis shows that, in the absence of visual awareness, emotional relative to neutral faces increase activation of subcortical regions as well as limbic areas in healthy individuals, potentially reflecting a stronger neural representation of emotional expressions. \n\nOur meta-analysis also revealed that cortical regions including the IFG, insula, STG, MTG and temporal pole were more strongly activated in response to unaware emotional compared to neutral faces. The IFG and insula are important for the integration of external information and internal bodily experience (e.g., emotional arousal; Terasawa et al.,  ) and show increased activity during conscious emotional experience (Miller & Cohen,  ; Vytal & Hamann,  ). Similarly, regions in the temporal cortex have been found to play a crucial role in emotion recognition (Fried et al.,  ) and the identification of emotional features (Adolphs,  ). Fearful and angry expressions, for example, were found to be associated with stronger activation of the MTG and several adjacent regions including the insula, compared to neutral faces, when presented supraliminally (Goghari et al.,  ). Our results confirm the roles of these cortical regions in emotion processing by showing that, even when visual awareness is highly restricted, the IFG, insula and regions in the temporal cortex can be significantly activated by emotional faces. \n\nHowever, there have been several claims that the activation of these regions, in particular the amygdala, do not differ between unconsciously processed emotional and neutral faces (Pessoa et al.,  ,  ). The existing contradictory results could be partially due to different experimental tasks. For example, in inattention tasks, one major difference is whether the facial emotions or the faces themselves were being attended. In some experiments, inattention towards the face stimuli was implemented by requiring participants to respond to non-emotional aspects of the faces (e.g., gender or age of the faces; Anderson et al.,  ; Habel et al.,  ). This is different from inattention implemented by asking participants to ignore the faces altogether and attend to images presented elsewhere (e.g., Vuilleumier et al.,  ), or overlapping images presented in the same spatial location (e.g., moving dots; Attar et al.,  ). In the current meta-analysis, we included studies where the faces were not attended at all for the inattention paradigms. With this stricter inclusion criterion in place, our current meta-analytic results reconcile the mixed findings with robust quantitative evidence showing that the limbic areas and contiguous cortical regions are indeed more strongly activated by emotional faces, compared to neutral faces, when they are not consciously processed. \n\nMoreover, across different inattention paradigms, other attention-related factors may vary. Specifically, the processing of unattended emotional faces has been found to be sensitive to participants\u2019 attentional load and task goals (Pessoa et al.,  ,  ). The inconsistencies between reporting increased neural responses for emotional relative to neutral faces in some studies (e.g., Vuilleumier et al.,  ) and the absence of such effects in other studies (e.g., Pessoa et al.,  ) could thus be due to differences in the control or manipulation of participants\u2019 attention. Further research can aim to systematically examine whether and how the strength of enhanced neural responses to unattended emotional faces changes as participants\u2019 attentional conditions vary. \n\n\n### Comparing sensory and attentional unawareness \n  \nImportantly in our examination of previous studies, different experimental paradigms showed different activation patterns when comparing unaware emotional to neutral faces. We found that attentional unawareness paradigms showed a right lateralization of activation. Specifically, inattention paradigms revealed stronger activity in the right amygdala and right temporal pole for unattended emotional compared to neutral faces. However, sensory unawareness paradigms (masking or binocular rivalry) revealed increased activations of the left striatum, left amygdala and right MTG by unseen emotional compared to neutral faces. \n\nRight hemisphere dominance has been widely investigated in the literature on face processing (e.g., face identity recognition; Vuilleumier et al.,   and emotion processing; Demaree et al.,  ) and attention (e.g., De Schotten et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ; Weintraub & Mesulam,  ). Studies on patients with unilateral spatial neglect have consistently shown that right parietal lesions are associated with more severe spatial neglect symptoms compared to left parietal lesions (for a review see Parton et al.,  ). In healthy individuals, the right visual cortex and its connections with the right amygdala are also implicated in the processing of emotional faces (Noesselt et al.,  ). Specifically, using a bilateral presentation of faces, Noesselt et al. ( ) found that participants\u2019 right visual cortex showed enhanced hemodynamic responses and increased connectivity with the right amygdala after the viewing of a fearful face, but not a neutral face, presented in the left hemifield. Consistent with these observations, our results show that for healthy individuals, right lateralized brain regions including the right amygdala are more strongly activated by unattended emotional relative to neutral faces, during inattention. \n\nComparisons of left and right hemianopics might provide further insights into the right lateralized activation by unattended emotional faces reported here (e.g., Bertini et al.,  ,  ,  ). In a series of experiments, emotional faces were presented supraliminally to the lesioned patients while the patients were required to respond either to the emotion of the faces presented in their blind visual field alone or to information concurrently presented in their intact visual field (for a review see L\u00e0davas & Bertini,  ). It was found that, while both left- and right-lesioned hemianopic patients could not detect stimuli presented alone in the blind visual field, patients with lesions to the left visual cortices tend to show improved performance at discriminating the emotion of faces in the intact field when a fearful face was concurrently shown in their blind field (e.g., Bertini et al.,  ). However, patients with right hemispheric lesions did not show such an implicit processing bias for fear-related signals in their blind field. It was therefore suggested that the right hemisphere is key to the unconscious processing of fearful faces (L\u00e0davas & Bertini,  ). As pointed out by L\u00e0davas and Bertini ( ), when presented concurrently with task-relevant information, the task-irrelevant emotional faces in the blind visual field can provide ambiguous information outside the accessible visual field. As attention has been deployed to parts of the visual display (i.e., intact visual field), information across the overall display may be able to access some, albeit limited, attentional resources. Consequently, unattended emotional faces could be processed possibly by engaging the right attention system, in left-lesioned hemianopic patients. In contrast, when information was presented only within the blind visual field of the patients, or when patients had right-hemispheric lesions, attention mechanisms were likely not activated at all, which could explain why emotional faces were not distinguished from neutral faces in both cases (L\u00e0davas & Bertini,  ). Here, our results show that a large right-lateralized neural network can be more strongly activated by unattended emotional relative to neutral faces in healthy individuals. However, emotional faces rendered unseen by masking or binocular rivalry seem unable to engage the right hemisphere system related to attention processes. \n\nIt should be noted that the number of included inattention studies was small (i.e., eight). This is due to the rather stringent inclusion criteria we used to obtain less biased meta-analytic results. Indeed, the results across all analyses were robust as indicated by high Jackknife sensitivity scores, low   I   statistics and non-significant Egger\u2019s test results. Further research is needed nevertheless to provide more insights into the neural fate of unattended emotional faces compared to unseen stimuli. Future research on unconscious emotion processing should also validate their manipulations of unawareness, especially in inattention studies. \n\nAdditionally, the distinction between task-irrelevant faces and task-irrelevant emotions should be regarded as crucial in the examination of the neural fate of unattended emotional faces. A previous meta-analysis on the implicit processing of emotional faces treated task-irrelevant faces and task-irrelevant emotions as a single category, and revealed stronger activation of higher-level frontal (i.e., IFG) and parietal regions (i.e., precuneus) for emotional faces, compared to neutral ones (Shi et al.,  ). However, our current results did not show activation of these regions, presumably because we limited the investigation to unattended faces. It is likely that the activation of higher-level cortical regions was specific to the attended emotional information about the faces (Shi et al.,  ). It is thus clear that minor variations in defining inattention can result in largely different meta-analytic results. \n\n\n### Comparing positive and negative emotions \n  \nIn the current meta-analysis, we also identified different activation patterns for positive and negative emotions. Compared to unaware neutral faces, unaware positive emotions were associated with stronger activation of the temporal and parietal cortices whereas unaware negative emotions elicited increased activation of the striatum and amygdala. The involvement of subcortical regions in the unconscious processing of negative emotions (e.g., fear, anger) has been well documented in the literature, as described above. Because negative emotions can act as informative cues about our environment, oftentimes indicating potential danger, a processing bias arises towards such stimuli (\u00d6hman & Mineka,  ), which as explained above, may be prioritized for processing through the subcortical pathway (Tamietto & De Gelder,  ). \n\nBy contrast, positive emotions like happy faces may not necessitate a fast relay of information as they tend not to be associated with threat, or require quick responses. As suggested by Xu et al. ( ), while negative emotions are likely processed rapidly through the subcortical path in addition to the cortical route, positive emotions like happy faces may be mainly processed via the latter. In the absence of visual awareness, subcortical regions may be therefore unable to efficiently distinguish neutral faces from positive ones. In line with this suggestion, our meta-analytic results show that the unconscious processing of positive emotions involves several temporal and parietal regions, consistent with previous research where increased activity in the temporal and parietal lobes were found during the processing of happy expressions (for a review see Machado & Cantilino,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current meta-analysis shows that unconsciously processed emotional faces elicit stronger activation of the limbic system, subcortical areas (i.e., striatum) and several cortical regions (i.e., IFG, insula and the temporal lobe), compared to neutral faces. Crucially, a right hemisphere dominance was found for the unconscious processing of emotional faces in attentional unawareness but not sensory unawareness. Additionally, in the absence of visual awareness, positive emotions were found to be associated with stronger activity in temporal and parietal cortices, whereas negative emotions were found to elicit stronger activation of subcortical regions including the amygdala and striatum, when compared to neutral faces. These findings indicate variations in patterns of activity in different conditions that reflect unconscious processing of emotions. Future studies could address these differences in a more systematic manner. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9581832,"text_md5":"ba7a1c4fe679f69df0c759ef0cdd8b13","field_positions":{"authors":[0,66],"journal":[67,86],"publication_year":[88,92],"title":[103,211],"keywords":[225,300],"abstract":[313,1796],"body":[1805,37077]},"batch":1,"pmid":35739373,"doi":"10.1007\/s11682-022-00697-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581832","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9581832"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581832\">9581832<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9581832  Neural activities during the Processing of unattended and unseen emotional faces: a voxel-wise Meta-analysis"}

Structurally, VBM analysis showed that the largest GMV diminutions in patients with ADHD were in several frontal-parietal brain regions, the limbic system, and the corpus callosum.

In addition, this meta-analysis discovered neuroanatomical or functional abnormalities in other brain regions in patients with ADHD as well as findings that can be utilized to guide future research. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a widespread neurodevelopmental disorder affected by multiple factors, which are often manifested as inattention and\/or impulsiveness hyperactivity ( ). The epidemiological investigation showed that over 5% of children and adolescents in the world are impacted by this illness ( ), and the morbidity is higher in boys, showing an increasing trend year by year. However, some symptoms of the children could continue into adulthood ( ), which would disturb the varied aspects of their learning, family, social lives, and\/or physical and psychological health (including a higher proportion of destructive behaviors, anxiety, depressive behaviors, substance use disorders, and so on) ( ,  ). \n\nAt present, studies in various fields, such as genetics ( ,  ), etiology ( ), neuropsychology ( ), and neurophysiology ( ), attempt to explore the pathological mechanisms of ADHD. Similar to other psychiatric and developmental disorders, ADHD has genetic susceptibility ( ,  ). Environmental factors (including psychosocial factors, prenatal and perinatal risk factors, nutritional factors, etc.) are also one of the risk factors for ADHD ( ,  ). Defects in mood regulation are common in patients with ADHD, which is considered a key factor associated with it ( ). Other studies showed that the lack of DA (dopamine) in functional brain areas, such as the cerebral cortex and the striatum, also leads to ADHD ( ). In addition, more neuroimaging studies ( \u2013 ) focused on patients with ADHD and considered ADHD an important research topic. A large amount of evidence suggests that ADHD has abnormal brain structure and function, although the effect sizes are small. \n\nVoxel-based morphometry is a scientific method used to measure and analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the voxel level ( ) and reflect anatomical differences   via   quantitatively calculating the differences in density or volume of the gray matter and white matter of each voxel in the MRI. However, most of the current research results are inconsistent. Some studies reported decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( ) and the right thalamus ( ) in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls (HCs), while some other studies reported decreased GMV in the frontal lobe, the hippocampus, the temporal cortex, and the occipital cortex using VBM ( ). Sutcubasi Kaya et al.'s study ( ) reported increased GMV in the precentral gyrus and the supplementary motor area in patients with ADHD. The differences from those of earlier studies are attributed to patients with ADHD having a relatively high average IQ in the current studies. McGrath et al. ( ) analyzed the structural neuroimaging data between dyslexia and ADHD, conducted an anatomic likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis on VBM studies of the two diseases, and identified an overlapping region of the right caudate nucleus when using a more relaxed statistical threshold. This suggests that the abnormality of caudate nucleus may be the basis of executive dysfunction. \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) describes the activation region of neural excitation by monitoring blood oxygen levels and using deoxyhemoglobin as an endogenous contrast agent, characterized by low time resolution and high spatial resolution ( ). At present, the fMRI studies of ADHD involve different executive function processes, and different task paradigms can be used to evaluate the same executive function, but there are a lot of heterogeneous research results in these studies ( ). Decreased activation in alert task-related brain areas in children with ADHD, including the right frontal-orbital, the superior frontal and bilateral temporoparietal regions, the cerebellum, the hippocampus, the striatum, and the thalamus, was reported in a study by Rubia et al. ( ). A meta-analysis of fMRI studies ( ) on children with ADHD, with low activation in executive function (frontal-parietal network) and attention (ventral attention network) and high activation in prefrontal and ventral attention networks, identified earlier abnormalities beyond abnormal prefrontal-striatal circuits. The recent meta-analysis ( ) of whole-brain fMRI showed reduced activation of the bilateral anterior insula putamen and the globus pallidus in the left inferior frontal gyrus in patients with ADHD during cognitive conversion tasks. \n\nRecently, the results of a combined VBM and fMRI analysis ( ) showed that reduced GMV and fMRI underactivation overlapped in the right caudate nucleus during cognitive control in patients with ADHD compared to HCs. Similar studies ( ) found that increased GMV and functional activation overlapped in the right fusiform gyrus, while decreased GMV and functional activation overlapped in the right superior temporal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left postcentral gyrus in patients with ADHD compared to HCs. Samea et al. ( ) pooled 96 studies in children and adolescents, and they observed the convergence dysfunction in the left pallidum\/putamen for task-fMRI experiments (using neutral stimuli) and decreased activity in the left IFG among different sub-analyses. This study has profoundly elaborated the structural and functional alterations of the brain in patients with ADHD; however, the results remain inconsistent, possibly due to the diversity of sample characteristics, behavioral scales, imaging methods, and statistical analyses, suggesting the need for in-depth investigation to confirm, broaden, and\/or amend previous findings. \n\nBased on previous theories and empirical studies in ADHD, we hypothesized that both functional and structural alterations in frontostriatal and fronto-cingulate circuits occur in patients with ADHD relative to HCs. In addition, studies suggest that some symptoms of ADHD in children will gradually get better with age but will not completely disappear. Therefore, we expect that more brain areas in the children group will show changed GMV and abnormal activation compared to the adult group. It may also be associated with delayed maturation of certain brain regions. The objective of our study was to explore the common and specific neural alterations in the structure and function of the brain in ADHD and further explore the differences in brain alterations between adults and children with ADHD. Eventually, the significance of these research results and their prospective development paths are examined and discussed. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and selection \n  \nA comprehensive literature search of fMRI and VBM studies of ADHD from January 2010 to November 2021 was conducted primarily using PubMed, as well as additional searches in the Web of Knowledge and Science Direct databases, with a combination of the following keywords: \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d or \u201cVBM\u201d or \u201cmorphometry\u201d or \u201cgray matter\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d and \u201cADHD\u201d or \u201cAttention Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder.\u201d In addition, a manual search was conducted in reference lists of previous meta-analyses. Eligible original studies were identified through reference tracking and consultation to retrieve high-quality meta-analyses and review articles. \n\nStudies were eligible if (1) they involved task-related fMRI or VBM study; (2) they compared patients with ADHD and HCs; (3) the whole-brain outcomes were presented in three-dimensional coordinates (  x, y, z  ) for changes in standard stereotactic space (e.g., Talairach space or Montreal Neurological Institute space); (4) the diagnosis of patients with ADHD had to be based on DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-V, or ICD-10; and (5) they were peer-reviewed and published in English as an article. Studies were excluded if (1) the peak coordinates were not reported; (2) VBM was not used and only ROI analyses were used; (3) the patient data were duplicated or no eligible contrasts were found; and (4) neurological or psychiatric comorbidities (such as depression, anxiety, autism, learning disorder, and so on) were found in the patient group. In the case of incomplete or ambiguous information, we will contact the author for clarification. \n\nAll the authors evaluated the final inclusion of articles and reached a consensus on all of them before implementing the following steps. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe anisotropic effect size seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) (version 5.15) meta-analytic software package ( ) was applied extensively in a recent meta-analysis. We plan to use it to analyze the GMV and functional neural activation changes between patients with ADHD and HCs, following related guidelines (MOOSE) for meta-analyses. In this study, we summarized the AES-SDM data processing procedure. First, the peak coordinates extracted from each dataset were manually imported into the software. Second, the maps of the lower and upper bounds of possible effect sizes were reconstructed for each VBM or fMRI study separately using an anisotropic non-normalized Gaussian kernel. Peak coordinates were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. After that, this mean analysis was processed, which consists of calculating the mean of the voxel values in the different studies. This mean is weighted by the inverse of the variance and accounts for inter-study heterogeneity. In addition, the results of some studies were   p  -value or   z  -value, which needed to be converted to t-statistics online; full width at half maximum (FWHM) was set to 20 mm because this setting was optimal to balance sensitivity and specificity, and other parameters included voxel   P   = 0.005, peak height   Z   = 1, and cluster extent = 10 voxels ( ). \n\nOur research steps are as follows: First, analyses were conducted to examine regional GMV in the patient group relative to HCs using all available data, and fMRI meta-analyses were performed to examine the neural activation abnormalities using the above same method. Second, a conjunction analysis in patient groups relative to HCs was further carried out to examine common areas of structural and functional abnormalities. Then, we divided individuals into two different subtypes based on age group (see   Table 2  ) for the next subgroup analysis, namely, adult and pediatric (including adolescents and children) subjects, using a random effects model under the same threshold as before. To examine the effects of age, gender, and IQ, meta-regression analyses were performed. Finally, to assess whether the results were replicable, a jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed, in which the same analysis was repeated in one study, excluding one data at a time. Moreover, Egger's test was used to examine the possible publication bias. A statistical threshold   p  -value of <0.005 was used for all meta-analyses ( ,  ), and a decreased threshold   p  -value of <0.0005 and a cluster extent of 20 voxels were applied in the meta-regression to control for false positives ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 1,463 published papers (624 VBM studies and 839 fMRI studies) were screened, with an increase of 21 documents (six VBM studies and 15 fMRI studies) discovered   via   other sources. After repetitions were eliminated, 591 documents (239 VBM studies and 352 fMRI studies) were reviewed, and 144 full-text publications (61 VBM studies and 83 fMRI studies) were evaluated for eligibility. The final sample included 29 VBM research (1,211 patients with ADHD and 1,032 HCs) and 36 fMRI research (850 patients with ADHD and 813 HCs) studies (see  ;   for more details). \n  \nMethods and results of literature search for ADHD fMRI and VBM.   n  , total number of studies;   n  1, number of VBM study;   n  2, number of fMRI study. \n    \nSample characteristics of VBM and fMRI studies. \n  \nNA: Not applicable. It indicates that the data is not applicable. \n  \nThe Wilcoxon   W  -tests in the whole-group VBM analysis indicated that patient groups did not differ in age (  z   = \u22120.325;   P   = 0.745), and the patient groups have a slightly lower IQ than the control groups (  z   = \u22122.653;   P   = 0.008). The chi-squared test revealed that both groups had a significantly higher proportion of boys\/men (\u03c7  = 8.450;   P   = 0.004). In the whole-group fMRI meta-analysis, patient groups did not differ in age (  z   = \u22121.077;   P   = 0.282), and the patient groups have a slightly lower IQ than the control groups (  z   = \u22123.616;   P   < 0.001), but a higher percentage of patients with ADHD were boys\/men (\u03c7  = 50.655;   P   < 0.001). Details of the regression analysis results of the subgroups are shown in  . As a result, age, IQ, and sex were included as covariates in all between-group meta-analyses performed including only these studies which were age-, IQ-, and sex-matched (see   for more details). \n  \nDemographic information for studies included in the meta-analysis. \n  \n### Regional differences in GMV and fMRI by meta-analysis \n  \n#### ADHD VBM \n  \nPatients with ADHD showed significantly lower GMV in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex\/median cingulate\/superior frontal gyrus\/olfactory cortex, the left precentral\/postcentral gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus opercular\/orbital part, the left supramarginal gyrus, the left caudate nucleus, the left anterior thalamic projections, the right gyrus rectus, and the corpus callosum compared to HCs. In contrast, the results also showed an increase in the left striatum\/lenticular nucleus, the right caudate nucleus, and the right anterior thalamic projections (see  ;  ). \n  \nMeta-analysis results for voxel-based morphometry and fMRI studies in ADHD. \n    \nResults of VBM and fMRI meta-analysis for ADHD (Green, GMV decreased in ADHD; Red, GMV increased in ADHD; Blue, hypoactivation in ADHD; Yellow, overactivation in ADHD). \n  \n\n#### ADHD fMRI \n  \nPatients with ADHD showed overactivation in the middle occipital gyrus, the right insula, the right precuneus cortex, the left cerebellum hemispheric lobule, and the left fusiform gyrus compared to HCs. In contrast, the results also showed hypoactivation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, the left middle\/inferior temporal gyrus, the left superior\/middle\/inferior frontal gyrus, the right precentral \/postcentral gyrus, the left insula, and the corpus callosum (see  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Multimodal VBM and fMRI analyses \n  \nIn patients with ADHD, there was an overlap between decreased GMV in the left inferior frontal gyrus and hypoactivation compared to HCs (MNI coordinates, \u221228, 16, \u221224; 17 voxels) (see  ). \n  \nResults of multimodal VBM and fMRI for ADHD. \n  \n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \n#### ADHD VBM \n  \nIndividuals were divided into two independent subgroups, namely, adult and pediatric groups (including adolescents and children). The findings of the adult group's (11 datasets) analysis were substantially in line with the pooled analysis, except for the additional significant GMV decrease in the right middle frontal gyrus. In addition, relative to the pooled analysis, no significant GMV decrease regions were found in the left supramarginal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Similarly, the results also indicated increased GMV in the left striatum and the left lenticular nucleus. The results of the pediatric group's (19 datasets) analysis showed GMV decrease in additional brain regions\u2014the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and the left insula. Similarly, relative to the pooled analysis, no significant GMV decrease regions were found in the left supramarginal gyrus, the left caudate nucleus, and the left anterior thalamic projections, the left precentral \/postcentral gyrus, and the right gyrus rectus. In addition, the results showed increased GMV in the left striatum, the left middle occipital gyrus, the right caudate nucleus, and the right anterior thalamic projections (see  ,  ;  ). \n  \nSubgroup analysis results for voxel-based morphometry and fMRI studies in ADHD (adults group). \n    \nSubgroup analysis results for voxel-based morphometry and fMRI studies in ADHD (pediatrics group). \n    \nResults of subgroup analysis of VBM for ADHD.

The findings of the adult group (11 datasets) were partly consistent with the pooled analysis, and significant hypoactivation in the bilateral insula, the left striatum, the left lenticular nucleus, the right superior temporal gyrus, the right precentral\/postcentral gyrus, the right caudate nucleus, the right anterior thalamic projections, and the corpus callosum was found. In addition, significant overactivation regions were found in the left middle occipital gyrus and the right middle temporal gyrus. Relative to the pooled analysis, in the pediatric group (22 datasets), no significant hypoactivation was found in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. On the contrary, overactivation of the right fusiform gyrus was found. The rest was largely consistent with the pooled analysis (see  ,  ;  ). \n  \nResults of subgroup analysis of fMRI for ADHD. Blue, hypoactivation in ADHD; Yellow, overactivation in ADHD. \n  \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nEgger's tests were conducted to investigate the potential publication bias. The results of the Egger's tests were non-significant (  P   > 0.05 for all comparisons, Bonferroni corrected), indicating that there was no publication bias. Jackknife reliability analyses revealed that the findings were robust in terms of disorder differentiation. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of our meta-analysis was to investigate the altered GMVs and functional happenings in patients with ADHD and further explore the differences in brain alterations between adults and children with ADHD. Our meta-analysis of structural studies showed that the largest GMV reductions in patients with ADHD relative to HCs were in several frontal parietal brain regions, the limbic system, and the corpus callosum. In addition, we also found that the GMV increased in some brain areas. In fMRI, our study discovered that patients with ADHD relative to HCs showed significant hypoactivation in several frontal-temporal brain regions, the right postcentral gyrus, the left insula, and the corpus callosum. Conversely, we observed overactivation in the middle occipital gyrus, the right insula, the right precuneus cortex, and the left cerebellum hemispheric lobule. Most of the brain region alterations we found were consistent with previous literature, suggesting that the results of the meta-analysis using the seed-based d mapping software package were credible. The results of the subgroup analysis further explored and supported the above results. Moreover, subgroup analysis found relatively more brain areas with reduced GMV and abnormal activation in children and adolescents relative to adults. This makes it clear that patients with ADHD may be associated with delayed maturation of brain development. \n\nIn recent years, ADHD has often been considered as related to brain changes in the frontal region. Earlier studies discovered reduced volume in the right superior frontal gyrus ( ) and the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal ( ). Bralten et al.'s ( ) VBM analysis mentioned that ADHD has a link with reduced GMV in the frontal and precentral regions (including the left precentral gyrus, the medial and left orbitofrontal cortices, the frontal pole, the paracingulate and cingulate cortices), concerning decision-making, executive function, and motor function areas. This is largely consistent with the results of our meta-analysis. In fMRI, we found hypoactivation in the left superior middle and the inferior frontal gyrus and the right anterior central gyrus. Task-based fMRI studies on patients with ADHD revealed inadequate activity in the frontal lobe and striatum ( ,  ). Regarding previous fMRI studies, patients with ADHD had lower activation for inhibition in the supplementary motor area, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to HCs ( ,  ). It is of great importance for the orbitofrontal cortex to regulate emotion and impulsive behavior, and impairment in this area may be the cause of impulsivity in ADHD ( ). Moreover, previous findings suggested that the prefrontal cortex and its connections may be closely related to ADHD symptoms including inattention, obliviousness, impulsivity, poor planning, and hyperaction in patients with ADHD ( ). In addition, our multimodal results show a decrease in the volume of the left subfrontal gyrus gray matter and a decrease in activity. Thus, our findings support the frontal-striatal circuit theory of ADHD and confirm prior VBM and fMRI studies on ADHD. Future longitudinal studies should strive to evaluate the long-term consequences of ADHD treatments on prefrontal volume and function to confirm the existing results. \n\nThe present findings also involve the limbic system-associated brain area. Because of its importance in symptom severity and emotional regulation, the anterior cingulate cortex has long been a focus of ADHD study ( ). Similarly, we also found that volume reductions in the bilateral anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus, the bilateral median cingulate, the bilateral olfactory cortex, and the left caudate nucleus. However, in the present pediatric group of subgroup analysis, we found no significant GMV decrease in the left caudate nucleus. In a study of 24 adolescent subjects with ADHD vs. HCs, the ADHD group had a lower mean (left and right) caudate and putamen volumes ( ). The article of Montes et al. ( ) suggested that patients with ADHD had a smaller GMV and a lower concentration of gray matter in the right caudate compared to HCs, both in the overall sample and within each sex. Moreover, a previous study ( ) found reduced GMVs in the right orbitofrontal cortex, the left anterior cingulate cortex, and the left posterior midcingulate cortex in patients with ADHD. Amico et al. ( ) found significantly smaller GMV in the right and left anterior cingulate cortices but no GMV difference in the PFC, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Bonath et al. ( ) discovered substantially lower GMV in participants with ADHD relative to their matched controls within the anterior cingulate cortex, within the bilateral hippocampus\/amygdala, and in broad cerebellar areas. Further, reduced anterior cingulate cortex GMV was also observed to connect with grades of selective inattention. However, these alterations in the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the cerebellum did not appear in our study-based VBM, indicating that they are less consistent across samples compared to the changes in the limbic system. Conversely, we also found that the GMV increased in the left striatum\/lenticular nucleus and the right caudate nucleus. Collectively, the limbic system should receive more attention in future research to explore the possible pathogenesis of ADHD. \n\nIn patients with ADHD, inattention was linked to reduced GMV not only in the frontal and anterior cingulate but also in the parietal regions. Although only a few ADHD functional MRI investigations have focused on the parietal cortex, it has been recognized as exhibiting changed function in ADHD. This can also be observed in our study, whose results showed that theparietal lobes (including the left postcentral gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus) are smaller in size in patients with ADHD. Simultaneously, we also found significant hypoactivation in the right postcentral gyrus. Previous research ( ) found that patients with ADHD doing a visual oddball task showed considerably reduced parietal cortex activation, including the superior parietal gyrus and numerous regions of the inferior parietal lobe. Another study ( ) indicated that, in participants with ADHD conducting a spatial working memory mental rotation assignment, the inferior parietal lobe activation was significantly lower, as well as parieto-occipital and caudate activation. Prior research ( ) found that successful inhibition activated a cluster of the right angular gyrus, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal gyrus in the ADHD group. These regions have been associated with action cancellation and action withholding ( ). A previous meta-analysis ( ) revealed that smaller GMV was found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule in subjects with ADHD. However, Seidman et al. ( ) found that adults with ADHD had significantly smaller GMVs in the inferior parietal cortex, relative to HCs. We speculated that this difference may be related to the maturational delay or sample diversity. The structural and functional abnormalities in the parietal lobes of those with ADHD further support the conclusion that the parietal cortex plays a role in the pathogenesis of ADHD in patients. \n\nIn addition, our analysis results suggest that the temporal lobe may play a crucial role in ADHD. The results of the meta-analysis of fMRI indicate significant hypoactivation in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left middle\/inferior temporal gyrus. However, decreased GMV was found in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus of the pediatric group alone. Sowell et al. ( ) found reduced GMV bilaterally in the lateral aspects of anterior and midtemporal cortices and increased GMV in the more posterior aspects of the temporal lobes bilaterally. The temporal lobe includes auditory language-related centers, while some children with ADHD have abnormal auditory language functions. Using VBM, the studies of Kobel et al. ( ) detected isolated areas in right temporal regions where boys with ADHD displayed decreased GMV, demonstrating some type of impairment to temporal brain matter due to ADHD. This result was further supported by a prior investigation ( ) where the authors discovered a link between damaged inhibitory control and decreases in medial temporal gray matter. Some studies ( ,  ) found insufficient activation in the left superior temporal gyrus. Although these temporal lobe abnormalities in the brain are not completely consistent, we reasoned that the temporal lobe plays a key role in the development of ADHD. As a result, we came to an agreement that research on ADHD ought not to be limited to the frontostriatal deficit hypothesis but also expanded the range to less studied brain areas like the temporal lobe. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that we simultaneously found reduced corpus callosum GMV in patients with ADHD relative to HCs and showed hypoactivation in the corpus callosum in fMRI. Considering the anterior or genu region of the corpus callosum connects homologous areas of the frontal cortex ( ), theories concerning ADHD being a frontal-striatal illness ( ) have motivated some scholars to anticipate that the anterior or genu region of the corpus callosum would be influenced. Significantly smaller areas have been reported in the total corpus callosum area and splenium ( ). The meta-analysis of Valera et al. ( ) also showed that the splenium located in the posterior region of the corpus callosum is smaller in individuals with ADHD. In patients with ADHD, there is evidence that there are sex disparities in the morphology and white matter integrity of the corpus callosum. For example, female patients with ADHD distinctly had a smaller splenium than male patients with ADHD, according to a meta-analysis ( ), while male children and adolescents with ADHD have a smaller anterior corpus callosum. Dramsdahl et al. ( ) discovered lower fractional anisotropy values in the isthmus\/splenium of the corpus callosum in the ADHD group, and subsequent investigation revealed that FA (fractional anisotropy) values in the posterior part of the corpus callosum were considerably lower in women than in men. These research results show that the role of the corpus callosum in ADHD should be further explored. \n\nThe meta-analysis of Jagger-Rickels et al. ( ) found reduced left and right insula volume in the ADHD group. Furthermore, in a previous large meta-analysis ( ) of sMRI and fMRI studies in children and adults with ADHD, the anterior insula was the only region with both structural and functional abnormalities. However, we found no statistically significant GMV change in the insula. However, overactivation was found in the right insula among patients with ADHD in our study, and this finding is consistent with the results of a previous study ( ). In contrast, we also found hypoactivation in the left insula. The insula is also a critical neural structure in the emotional response during decision-making ( ). Vetter et al. ( ) demonstrated that male patients with ADHD who did not have oppositional defiant disorder\/conduct disorder had hyperactivation of the anterior insula for negative stimuli, and hyperactivation of the anterior insula is the basis of this emotional lability. \n\nIn our study, increased activation was also found in the left middle occipital gyrus, right precuneus, and left cerebellar hemisphere among patients with ADHD compared to HCs. Occipital cortex, as the center of visual cortex, is responsible for the processing of visual information. To maintain attention, occipital cortex interacts with the dorsal attention network ( ), inhibiting the attention caused by irrelevant stimuli ( ), whereas the attention caused by hardly ignoring irrelevant stimuli is one of the main symptoms of ADHD. The precuneus is related to visual imagery, attention, and memory retrieval by engaging in the visual process and integrating relevant memory ( ). A possible explanation is that high activation in the left middle occipital gyrus and the right precuneus is associated with the severity of symptoms of impulsive craving in patients with ADHD. Although many studies reported abnormalities of structure and function in the cerebellar in patients with ADHD, our study did not reveal its structural differences but found that the left cerebellar hemisphere showed high activation on the task-state fMRI. A recent study ( ) suggests that inadequate neuromodulation of prefrontal-cerebellar circuits may underlie cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD). In addition, studies ( ) showed that both MPH and ATX can restore abnormal brain function in ADHD, mainly involving fronto-cingulo-parieto-cerebellum circuit. In conclusion, the brain changes of patients with ADHD may not be influenced by a single brain region but by multi-channel connections or there may be a certain brain region that is the most critical, which needs to be further studied by other methods such as brain structural network covariation and functional connectivity in the future. \n\nThe main results of the whole-group analysis were also found in the adult group and the pediatric group, which further supported the whole-group results. Alterations in the left superior frontal gyrus and the corpus callosum persisted in the pediatrics group and adult group, which we believe further illustrates the crux of this brain region. Subgroup analysis found relatively more brain areas with reduced GMV and abnormal activation in children and adolescents compared to adults. Longitudinal MRI studies ( ,  ) have already shown that structural differences in the frontal, striatal, parietal, and cerebellar regions of children with ADHD could be caused by a delay in structural maturation. The research of Hoogman et al. ( ) proposed a related model of ADHD brain maturation delay disorder and found a peak delay in subcortical volume maturation. The pediatric group result in our study found that both the left insula and the left superior temporal gyrus reduced GMV in the VBM meta-analysis and hypoactivation in the fMRI meta-analysis, and no such finding was observed in the adult group. The left insula and the left superior temporal gyrus brain area were changed in the pediatric group, but they did not change in the adult group, and we could consider that the alterations in these brain areas may result from delayed maturation. One study showed that many adult patients with ADHD have improved symptoms compared to childhood ( ). In addition, evidence reveals that the symptoms of ADHD, as well as ADHD diagnosis, are linked to substantial alterations in the macroscopic and microscopic structures of the brain. Therefore, we speculate that abnormal structure and function of some brain regions in patients with ADHD may also be gradually normal with increasing age, and these brain regions are caused by delayed maturation disorder, which still needs further research to prove. \n\n\n## Limitation \n  \nOur study has several limitations that are inherent in all meta-analyses. In the first place, since it was based predominantly on the peak coordinates of published studies, instead of raw statistical brain maps, it may be underpowered to identify some results with small or moderate effect sizes. Second, for the many papers included in this meta-analysis, different statistical thresholds may have been applied. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the methodologies among VBM and fMRI studies could not be prevented, such as the differences in MRI machines, smoothing kernel size, statistical thresholding, and so on, which might have caused conflicting results. Moreover, fMRI studies are mostly based on tasks in different attention, inhibition, time, and motivation domain, and then, the results may not be precise enough. Future studies should minimize these differences and confounding variables to get a more convincing result. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nADHD has far-ranging structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. The VBM meta-analysis found reduced GMV in the left superior frontal gyrus and the corpus callosum in patients with ADHD compared to HCs. Studies in task-related fMRI found that patients with ADHD showed low activation in the abovementioned brain regions. We hold the opinion that abnormal alterations in the structure and function of the left superior frontal gyrus and the corpus callosum may be the key brain regions involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD in patients and may be employed as an imaging metric for patients with ADHD pending future research. This meta-analysis also identified neuroanatomical or functional abnormalities in other brain regions in ADHD. Besides, subgroup analysis further explored and supported the above results, and this information can be applied to guide future studies. However, there is a need for more research in this area because of the lack of clarity on the confounding effects. Our results, as solid as it appears, should be read with caution. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nMY and XG designed the experiment.

We conducted a systematic review and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the fMRI studies conducted in BPD patients compared to healthy controls (HC). We systematically searched PubMed and PsychINFO from inception until July 9th 2020 using combinations of database-specific terms like \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018Neuroimaging\u2019, \u2018borderline\u2019. Eligible studies employed task-based fMRI of the brain in participants of any age diagnosed with BPD compared to HC, during any behavioral task and providing a direct contrast between the groups. From 762 entries, we inspected 92 reports full-texts and included 52 studies (describing 54 experiments). Across all experiments, the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD and BPD\u2009>\u2009HC meta-analyses did not yield any cluster of significant convergence of differences. Analyses restricted to studies of emotion processing revealed two significant clusters of activation in the bilateral hippocampal\/amygdala complex and anterior cingulate for the BPD\u2009>\u2009HC meta-analysis. Fail-safe N and single study sensitivity analysis suggested significant findings were not robust. For the subgroup of emotional processing experiments, on a restricted number of experiments providing results for each group separately, another meta-analysis method (difference of convergence) showed a significant cluster in the insula\/inferior frontal gyrus for the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD contrast. No consistent pattern of alteration in brain activity for BPD was evidenced suggesting substantial heterogeneity of processes and populations studied. A pattern of amygdala dysfunction emerged across emotion processing tasks, indicating a potential pathophysiological mechanism that could be transdiagnostic. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM 5), Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability referred to interpersonal relationship, self-image and affects together with marked impulsivity and emotional dysregulation . The disorder has a considerable prevalence (5.9% lifetime ) and is associated with significant and widespread impairment of patients\u2019 lives . A plethora of neuroimaging studies , most of which employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), attempted to delineate the neurobiological underpinnings of BPD. However, findings across different types of tasks were divergent. For example, some studies showed activation increased in the amygdala , insula , occipital, frontal and temporal areas , while others reported decreased activation in both frontal and temporal regions , cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens . Yet other studies found no significant differences in activation between BPD and healthy subjects (HC) . These contradictory findings could be due to methodological aspects related to differences in the processes studied (i.e, emotion processing, theory of mind, cognitive functions), paradigms or stimuli used, but also use of small samples, Region of Interest (ROI) analysis or uncorrected statistics. Conversely, heterogeneous findings could be indicative of \u201creal\u201d heterogeneity among BPD patient populations. \n\nHence, we conducted a systematic review and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the fMRI studies conducted in BPD patients compared to healthy controls. The meta-analytical technique considers nuclei of activation reported in single experiments as spatial probability distributions centered at the coordinate itself. These distributions are then used for the generation of a brain map representing the likelihood of activation of each candidate location . An earlier meta-analysis on 19 studies  focused solely on the contrast between negative and neutral stimuli and found higher convergence of differences in BPD as compared to HC in the left amygdalae and in the posterior cingulate, along with a blunted response of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we implemented a broader approach to BPD as we hypothesized that despite heterogeneity, a consistent pattern of dysfunction in BPD would nonetheless emerge, with more specific patterns observed in homogeneous subgroups. In particular, network analysis highlighted  difficulties in emotional regulation as central features of BPD, while several reports underscored overlapping brain networks related to negative emotion processes and working memory  or even a casual effect of difficulties in emotional regulation on other cognitive functions such mentalizing  and working memory . Thus, we expected that associated neurobiological dysfunctions would also impact other mental functions and hence emerge consistently across studies, despite the use of different tasks or evaluation domains. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nThe study was pre-registered on PROSPERO repository (CRD42019121856) and is reported following the PRISMA guidelines  (see   for PRISMA checklist). We conducted systematic searches in PubMed and PsychINFO from inception until 9th of July 2020. We used combinations of database-specific terms as \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018borderline\u2019, \u2018Neuroimaging\u2019 (see Fig.   and   for the exact search string). Eligible studies (1) employed task-based fMRI of the brain in (2) participants of any age diagnosed with BPD according to the DSM IV, IV-TR or 5, based on diagnostic interviews, with or without comorbid disorders, (3) compared to a matched healthy control group (HC), during (4) any behavioral task using the same experimental paradigm was used for both BPD and HC, and had to include (5) a direct univariate comparison of brain activation between BPD and HC (i.e., BPD\u2009>\u2009BPD and\/or BPD\u2009>\u2009HC), for which (6) 3D coordinates of peak activations in stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach were reported, and (7) whole-brain (i.e., not just Region of Interest\/ROI) analysis were employed. There were no restrictions regarding receipt of any kind of treatment, past or current. For multiple reports on overlapping samples, only one (i.e., the one with the largest sample) was included. Reviews, meta-analyses and case-studies were excluded. Studies in English and Italian were considered eligible. Two authors (GD, CG) independently screened and selected studies.

Data were extracted independently by two researchers (EdR, GD). \n\n\n### Risk of Bias \n  \nThe Risk of Bias (RoB) of included studies were evaluated with a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) , (mNOS) adapted to fMRI data  (See   for details). \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis \n  \nStereotactic coordinates for the ALE meta-analysis were extracted from the studies. The ALE algorithm was used as implemented in GingerALE 3.02 software . We used the correction proposed by Turkeltaub and colleagues , as implemented in GingerALE to control for multiple comparisons on the same dataset. Sample size for each experiment were used to calculate the Full\u2010Width Half\u2010Maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian function used to blur the foci. Coordinates in the MNI 152 standard space were converted into the Talairach space using the GingerALE foci converter tool. \n\nTwo approaches can be employed in an ALE meta-analysis of two groups. The first (\u201cconvergence of activation differences\u201d) uses coordinates from the contrast \u2018patients vs. controls\u2019 (i.e., patients\u2009>\u2009controls and controls\u2009>\u2009patients). The second (\u201cdifferences in convergence\u201d) pools the activation reported within each group separately, and subsequently computes a contrast between the resultant ALE-maps. We performed both for each of the two contrasts of interest (i.e., HC\u2009>\u2009BPD, BPD\u2009>\u2009HC) in each experiment. \n\nWe used convergence of activation differences as the primary analysis because it used data from all included studies. Statistical significance was assessed and corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-based method implemented in GingerALE:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 cluster forming threshold,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 cluster corrected FWE and   N  \u2009=\u20092000 permutations. \n\nTo check the robustness of the findings we performed a pooled analysis combining coordinates across BPD\u2009>\u2009HC and HC\u2009>\u2009BPD. This analysis reflects a more adequate summary of group differences because at the single study level, differences in analysis approaches and control conditions may have influenced the direction of reported group differences. To explore heterogeneity, we also conducted post-hoc sensitivity analyses by assembling more homogeneous subgroups of similar studies, based on extracted study characteristics such as type of task (e.g., passive or active tasks), type of stimuli (e.g., International Affective Picture System - IAPS) or type of domain evaluated (e.g., memory, impulsivity, emotion). \n\nAs additional robustness checks for analyses that produced significant findings, we conducted a \u201cFail-Safe N\u201d analysis adapted for ALE meta-analysis  to evaluate the potential publication bias, and a \u201cleave-one-out\u201d analysis to assess the impact of single studies on the results. \n\nFor the secondary analysis (differences in convergence), we computed separate meta-analyses for activations of controls and BPD and then contrasted them in a differences of convergence analysis. For the single group meta-analysis, we used the same parameters as in the primary analysis. To compute the differences of convergence, we used an uncorrected   p   value\u2009<\u20090.05,   N  \u2009=\u200910.000 permutations and a cluster threshold of 100\u2009mm . \n\nPotential differences between the two methods could be attributed to the different number of included studies rather than to genuine discrepancies between methods. We tested for this hypothesis in sensitivity analyses, in which the primary and secondary methods were limited to the experiments reporting coordinates for the same type of contrasts for both single- and between groups results. (Fig.  ,  ). \n\nAcross all analyses, we set the minimum number of studies to 17. According to previous simulations, meta-analyses with less than 17 studies are likely to have insufficient power to detect smaller effects, increasing the risk that results are driven by single\/few experiments . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nThe search produced 762 entries (463 after duplicate removal), 371 of which were excluded based on the abstract, leaving 92 reports for full-text inspection. From these, 40 reports were further excluded due to (1) lack of direct univariate comparison between BPD and HC (  n  \u2009=\u20099); (2) comparison restricted to functional connectivity analysis (  n  \u2009=\u20095); (3) non-significant results for the comparison (  n  \u2009=\u20094); (4) ROI only reported (  n  \u2009=\u200921); (5) re-analyses of previous, already included, studies or paper reported no new results (  n  \u2009=\u20091). A total of 52 articles (Table   and Supplementary Table  ) were included in the meta-analysis, as described in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig.  ). The 52 articles described 56 experiments and we further excluded two experiments for lack of significant results for the primary or secondary analysis.   \nCharacteristics of the included studied including, number of participants, gender and mean age of participants, comorbidities, concurrent treatments, type of tasks and type of stimuli used. \n  \n Comorbidity?   comorbidity was not declared,   \u2013   comorbidity was an exclusion criteria,   AAD   alchool abuse disorder,   ADD   attention deficit disorder,   ADHD   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,   Aff D   affective disorder,   AjD   adjustment disorder,   AN   anorexia nervosa,   Anx D   anxiety disorder,   AP   agoraphobia,   APD   antisocial personality disorder,   AvPD   avoidant personality disorder,   BD   bipolar disorder,   BDD   body dysmorphic disorder,   BED   binge eating disorder,   BN   bulimia nervosa,   DA   drug abuse,   DD   dissociative disorder,   Depr PD   depressive personality disorder,   DPD   dependent personality disorder,   DYS   dyshymia,   ED   eating disorder,   GAD   generalized anxiety disorder,   HPD   histrionic personality disorder,   HYP   hypochondria,   IED   intermitted explosive disorder,   MDCE   mixed disorder of conduct and emotion,   MDD   major depressive disorder,   NPD   narcisistic personality disorder,   OCD   obsessive compulsive disorder,   OCPD   obsessive compulsive personality disorder,   P-APD   passive-aggressive personality disorder,   PD   panic disorder,   PG   pathological gambling,   PH   phobia,   PPD   paranoid personality disorder,   PTSD   post-traumatic stress disorder,   SAD   social anxiety disorder,   SD   somatization disorder,   SFD   somatoform disorder,   Spec P   specific phobia,   SPD   somatization pain disorder,   STPD   schizotypal personality disorder,   Sub D   substance use disorder,   SzPD   schizoid personality disorder,   Medication?   the medication status of the subjects was not described, \u2013 ongoing medication was an exclusion criteria,   AD   antidepressants,   AEP   anti-epileptic drugs,   AP   antipsychotics,   Atypical AD   atypical antidepressants,   b-block   beta blockers,   BDZ   benzodiazepines,   Li   lithium,   MAOIs   monoamine oxidase inhibitors,   MS   mood stabilizers,   NaSSA   noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants,   PD   psychotropic drugs,   SNRI   serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors,   SSRI   serotonin reuptake inhibitors,   TAD   tryciclic antidepressant,   Task & stimuli   type of stimuli,   AAP   the adult attachment projective,   A&R   the AR face database, Martinez and Benavente (1998),   Affective ToM   affective theory of mind,   EMR\/SMR   episodic and semantic memory retrieval task,   EPS   empathy picture system,   EWMT   emotional working memory task,   IAPS   international affective picture system,   JCFEE   Matsumoto and Ekman\u2019s Japanese and Caucasian facial expressions of emotion,   KDEF   The Karolinska directed emotional faces, Lundqvist et al.

All studies performed whole-brain analyses. For the primary analysis we used 52 experiments: 24 reported both contrasts HC\u2009>\u2009BPD and BPD\u2009>\u2009HC, seven the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD contrast only, whereas 21 the BPD\u2009>\u2009HC contrast only. Twenty-three studies also reported single group analyses (Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ): 21 for both HC and BPD, one for HC only and two for BPD only. A complete description of the studies including type of task, stimuli, presence of comorbidity and medications status is presented in the Table  ). Based on these characteristics, we assembled more homogenous groups for sensitivity analyses. We conducted analyses restricted to studies (1) using only active or (2) passive tasks; (3) employing a task related to emotion processing (generation, recognition, regulation) (4) restricted to unmedicated patients. \n\n\n### Risk of bias \n  \nAccording to our mNOS scale scores no study presents a high risk of bias, eleven have low risk while the great majority (41) have an intermediate risk (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Fig.  ). The full description of the study quality is described in the  . \n\n\n### Primary analysis: convergence of differences \n  \nFor the voxel-wise whole-brain analysis 51 reports (52 experiments) were considered. For the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD meta-analysis we included 31 experiments and obtained a minimum cluster size of 624 (MCS) mm\u00b3, while for the BPD\u2009>\u2009HC meta-analysis we included 45 experiments and obtained an MCS of 752\u2009mm\u00b3. Across both ALE meta-analyses, we did not find any cluster of significant convergence. \n\n\n### Sensitivity analyses for primary analysis \n  \nIn analysis restricted to studies of emotion processing (42 experiments) for the contrast BPD\u2009>\u2009HC (34 experiments, MCS 656\u2009mm ), we found significant clusters in the two amygdalae along with the anterior cingulate (ACC)\/middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (Table   and Fig.  ). For the contrast HC\u2009>\u2009BPD (24 Experiments, MCS 680) we did not find any significant cluster.   \nSensitivity analysis for the primary analysis (convergence of difference) including studies on emotions (without considering impulsivity and reward). \n  \nResults are cluster-wise corrected (uncorrected   p   value\u2009<\u20090.001, cluster-wise corrected   p   value\u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n HC   healthy controls,   BPD   Borderline Personality Disorders,   MFG   Middle Frontal Gyrus,   ACC   Anterior Cingulate Cortex. \n     Sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis (convergence of difference) including studies with Emotional task (without studies on impulsivity) as stimuli for the BPD > HC meta-analysis.  \nResults are cluster-wise corrected (uncorrected   p   value\u2009<\u20090.001, cluster-wise corrected   p   value\u2009<\u20090.05). R right side, ALE-  p   value activation likelihood estimation probability. \n  \n\nWe were interested in the distinct pattern of activation related to emotional regulation, however only six studies specifically addressed emotional modulation in BPD , too few for a meta-analysis. As impulsivity is a key feature of BPD  with specific brain correlates only partially overlapping with the broader emotional circuits, we considered these studies separately. However, only four  studies examined impulsivity. \n\nAnalyses restricted to studies of unmedicated individuals showed largely similar results of the emotional processing meta-analysis ( , Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). Another sensitivity analysis restricted to studies using active tasks did not produce significant results. There were too few studies using passive tasks (12 for BPD\u2009>\u2009HC and 2 for HC\u2009>\u2009BPD) to run a meta-analysis. Finally, the pooled analysis using both the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD and the BPD\u2009>\u2009HC contrasts in the same meta-analysis did not show significant results ( ). \n\nThe leave-one-out procedure conducted on the subgroup of emotion processing studies (the only ones with statistically significant findings), showed that the clusters in the right amygdala remained significant 29 over 34 times, the cluster in the left amygdala, 27 times and the ACC\/MFG cluster 24 times. Notably, excluding one particular study  led to no significant cluster of convergence, excluding three studies  led to only one significant cluster, and excluding other 13 studies preserved two out of three significant clusters (Table  ). The Fail-Safe N analysis showed that the addition of only two studies rendered the ACC\/MFG cluster no longer significant. Similarly, three hypothetical studies would make the left amygdala finding null. Adding 33 studies would result in no remaining significant cluster of convergence (Supplementary Fig.  ).   \nLeave-one-out (LOO) analysis. \n  \nThe columns 2\u20134 indicates whether each article contributes directly to the cluster according to the gingerALE program; columns 5\u20137 indicates the effect of each article removal on the results in the three significant clusters; column 8 indicates the number of clusters remaining after leave each article out. \n  \n\n\n### Secondary analysis: difference in convergences \n  \nTwenty-three experiments reported coordinates for single group analyses (23 for HC and 22 for BPD) (  and Supplementary Table  ). Results for the meta-analysis within each group are reported in the Supplement (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Fig.  ). No significant clusters were identified for the BPD\u2009>\u2009HC contrast. For the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD a significant cluster of difference in convergences between the two groups was highlighted in the right insula\/ inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nThe number of eligible studies for all sensitivity analyses less than 17. Nevertheless, we computed exploratory sensitivity analyses (considering only emotion processing and respectively only active task experiments), which showed no significant results (see  ) (Supplementary Tables   and   and Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe report, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis comprising all fMRI neuroimaging studies for borderline personality disorder. The main findings underscore the substantial heterogeneity of this literature, in reference to the processes studied (e,g., emotion , impulsivity , attention and working memory ), as well as study populations (e.g., concomitant medication, comorbidities). Importantly, though impulsivity and emotional dysregulation are cardinal symptoms of BPD, they were assessed in few studies (four and six respectively). However, methodological differences can represent other important sources of heterogeneity. A variety of behavioral tasks were used, and it is likely that some were more reliable and robust in measuring the target processes than others, as demonstrated in a large-scale analysis of self-regulation measures . Moreover, analytic pipelines including pre-processing, choices in data analysis like the type of multiple comparison corrections employed most likely diverged between studies, with direct consequences on the threshold for identifying statistical findings . The relationship between analytic choices and reporting statistically significant findings is particularly relevant for ALE meta-analyses, which exclusively rely on these results and cannot consider non-significant one . \n\n### Convergence of differences \n  \nAnalyses restricted to more homogeneous subgroups highlighted significant clusters of convergence in the primary analysis. Specifically, we found dysfunctional pattern in the two amygdalae and ACC\/MFG across emotion processing tasks. Of note, analyses limited to studies with non-medicated patients also resulted in a significant cluster of convergence in the right hippocamus\/amygdala. Nonetheless, all the studies on unmedicated participants also investigated emotional processing, which might account for the overlap in results. \n\nThe role of the amygdala complex in emotional processing is well-established. Emotional responses were associated with activations of the amygdalae , while effective emotional regulation strategies reduce amygdala reactivity . Furthermore, anxiety disorders and mood disorders  are characterized by amygdala hyperreactivity, normalized by effective pharmacological and psychological treatments . Thus, our results support the role of amygdala dysfunction as a transdiagnostic mechanism, present in BPD, similarly to other disorders. It was hypothesized that behavioral alterations in emotional regulation and impulsivity in BPD rely on abnormal amygdala activity or a dysfunctional interaction between amygdala and prefrontal cortex, in line with findings on studies for emotional processing . As a consistent finding in BPD and as marker of emotional dysfunction on BPD, amygdala altered activity was proposed as a potential predictor of treatment response as well as a target for neurofeedback interventions . Finally, the development of new drug treatments has been hypothesized and tested considering their known action over amygdala activity . A similar transdiagnostic role could be attributed to ACC, though this region was less frequently reported in prior studies. Activation in this region has been reported while retrieving emotionally negative life events , during social exclusion  and while processing negative emotions  more generally. All these processes are affected in BPD, as well as in other emotional disorders. \n\nOur findings partially confirm those of an earlier meta-analysis by Schulze and colleagues . Divergences may stem from the fact the current meta-analysis included almost twice as many studies, (34 vs. 19 for the emotional processing sub-group) reflecting the large number of studies published in the last 4 years. Other sources of discrepancy include different inclusion criteria, meta-analytic approaches (as Schulze and colleagues used Anisotropic Effect Size Signed Differential Mapping , which allows the combination of coordinates and unthresholded maps) and contrasts selected in the analysis. \n\nDespite the considerably larger pool of studies, the robustness of the emotional processing findings is limited. Fail-Safe N analysis showed that as few as three additional null studies would render the clusters in the ACC and in the left amygdala no longer significant. Conversely, for the right amygdala, 33 studies with null findings would render the result not statistically significant. The Fail-Safe N is a proxy for potential publication bias (i.e., studies that were conducted, but remained unpublished, \u201cin the file-drawer\u201d, because of negative or null results). According to the adaptation of this method for ALE meta-analysis , for findings to be robust to publication bias, at least twice the number of included studies should be necessary to make them non-significant. In the present report, additional evidence for publication bias comes from the high number of studies that could not be included due to not reporting significant findings or conducting only ROI analyses. Thus, the hypothetical null studies suggested by the Fail-Safe N might not even have to be searched in the file-drawer, but already published. Solutions for clarifying similar issues in the neuroimaging literature include access to unthresholded maps, for example by posting them in public repositories, so as to allow studies with null or negative findings to be included in neuroimaging meta-analyses. Likewise, pre-registration of ROI analyses , by guaranteeing these analyses were not contingent to non-significant whole-brain results, could support their inclusion in meta-analyses. The results of the leave-one-out analysis for the emotional processing subgroup similarly point to limited robustness. The three significant clusters were maintained in only 13 iterations, but with the exclusion of a single study , no results remain significant. This suggests that findings are heavily influenced by a few individual studies. \n\nFinally, we failed to find convergence for the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD. While this contrast was reported in only 24 experiments, it is interesting to note that only four studies specifically discussed the dysfunction of emotional processing. As dysfunctions in emotional modulation are believed to be caused by a lack of activation in the prefrontal cortex in BPD, we speculate that a higher number of studies on emotional regulation would result in significant HC\u2009>\u2009BPD convergence. \n\n\n### Difference in convergence \n  \nThe contrast HC\u2009>\u2009BPD resulted in a significant cluster of difference of convergence in the right insula\/IFG complex. The activation of the inferior frontal gyrus has been often described for tasks related to emotional regulation and modulation , thus is not surprising how control subjects showed a higher convergence in this region as compared to BPD. This might be due to a general lack of IFG activity in BPD or to a higher heterogeneity of brain activations in this group. \n\n\n### Convergence of difference or difference in convergence? \n  \nAccording to Muller and colleagues the difference between the convergence of difference and difference in convergence approaches are mirrored by the research question one wants to answer . The former aims at identifying common difference between groups across the experiments, whereas the latter focuses to the convergence within the groups across the experiments and then to their possible differences. We confirm that these two approaches produce divergent findings, as previously shown . Comparison of the two methods restricted to experiments reporting the data required to run both resulted in a significant cluster in the anterior cingulate for convergence of difference, and another in the left insula for difference of convergence, for the HC\u2009>\u2009BPD contrast, suggesting that divergences between the two methods are not imputable to different numbers of studies. \n\nThe discrepancy between the two approaches is probably rooted into the ALE meta-analysis method of taking only coordinates of significant clusters. We proposed that the convergence of differences method is more feasible for contrasting groups, because it generally relies on a larger number of studies and is usually more concordant with findings from individual studies . In our work, differences might also be related to the relatively poor robustness of the primary analysis findings. For example, Hazellet and colleagues , a study that if excluded resulted into two of the three significant clusters becoming non-significant, did not provide single group results, so could not be used for the difference in convergence analysis. \n\nHowever, the two methods could also be viewed as complementary. In a recent ALE meta-analysis on depression the heterogeneity of the depressed patients was proposed as a possible reason for the lack of significant convergence : the depressed groups of each study might be too neurobiologically different among each other thus the convergence of difference did not produce consistent results. Specifically, while we found no significant clusters with the difference of convergence method, we did find clusters of convergence for both HC and BPD with the convergence of difference method. This suggests that despite task-related heterogeneity, a common pattern of activation within BPD patients can be identified. We suggest that this result is a hint to the fact that the heterogeneity of BPD population is similar to the one of healthy controls although a more formalized and quantitative approach to heterogeneity should be applied (e.g., ) to confirm this speculation. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nBy design, ALE meta-analysis can only quantify convergence probabilities and not magnitude of activations. The method provides a probability of convergence, that is, concordance of statistically significant foci across experiments in terms of probability distributions centered at the each set of focus coordinates . Moreover, coordinate based meta-analyses rely exclusively on coordinates for contrasts that reached statistical significance, as defined in each individual study. Consequently, these methodologies involve a significant loss information as compared to aggregation of fMRI unthresholded maps  and cannot take into account publication bias . Unfortunately, open sharing of unthresholded maps remains limited . Another limitation is related to the considerable number of studies that were excluded due to reporting only on ROI analyses (  N  \u2009=\u200923). Though the ROI approach is widely employed in neuroimaging studies, particularly in small sample studies, it is associated with increased risk of false positives or overestimation of effects . Moreover, its use is discouraged in coordinate based meta-analysis . Unfortunately, requests for whole-brain results are often not honored . \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies identified a consistent, albeit not robust, pattern of activation for emotional processing. No other common pattern of convergence of activation emerged, probably owing to the high between-study heterogeneity, ranging from tasks, populations and analytic approaches. Our findings mirror those of another ALE meta-analysis on unipolar depression . Though this meta-analysis included a large number of neuroimaging experiments (99), overall analyses across cognitive and emotional processing experiments, as well as subgroup analyses, revealed no consistent pattern of convergence. As possible causes for the lack of significant convergence of activation, the authors list differences among individual studies (such as the use of uncorrected inference procedures, differences in experimental design and contrasts, or heterogeneous clinical populations) and meta-analytic approaches (such as different inclusion and exclusion criteria or too liberal statistical inference methods). Though we did report a pattern of amygdala and ACC dysfunction in studies of emotion processing, it was not robust to possible publication bias and single study effects. Amygdala dysfunction might represent a promising pathophysiological mechanism, as a well target for novel therapeutic strategies , though, conversely, it might also indicate a transdiagnostic marker of difficulties in emotional processing and regulation. Further studies may disentangle this aspect particularly evaluating emotional regulation difficulties both in BPD and across psychopathological domains with a single paradigm. Network analyses have shown how difficulties in emotional regulation are the most relevant core feature of BPD , applying the same approach to neuroimaging data across psychiatric disorders may help to clarify the specificity of the present findings. Perhaps more importantly than conducting new studies, public sharing of unthresholded maps  from already conducted ones would represent a great advance in the understanding of the neurobiology of BPD. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8144551,"text_md5":"8b7e396541da2849051a6d15e6f4f884","field_positions":{"authors":[0,104],"journal":[105,122],"publication_year":[124,128],"title":[139,234],"keywords":[248,299],"abstract":[312,2197],"body":[2206,34072]},"batch":1,"pmid":34031363,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-021-01446-z","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8144551","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8144551"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8144551\">8144551<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8144551  Parsing variability in borderline personality disorder: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies"}

Multiple reports of resting state fMRI in MDD describe group effects. Such prior knowledge can be adopted to pre-select potentially discriminating features for diagnostic classification models with the aim to improve diagnostic accuracy. Purpose of this analysis was to consolidate spatial information about alterations of spontaneous brain activity in MDD, primarily to serve as feature selection for multivariate pattern analysis techniques (MVPA). Thirty two studies were included in final analyses. Coordinates extracted from the original reports were assigned to two categories based on directionality of findings. Meta-analyses were calculated using the non-additive activation likelihood estimation approach with coordinates organized by subject group to account for non-independent samples. Converging evidence revealed a distributed pattern of brain regions with increased or decreased spontaneous activity in MDD. The most distinct finding was hyperactivity\/hyperconnectivity presumably reflecting the interaction of cortical midline structures (posterior default mode network components including the precuneus and neighboring posterior cingulate cortices associated with self-referential processing and the subgenual anterior cingulate and neighboring medial frontal cortices) with lateral prefrontal areas related to externally-directed cognition. Other areas of hyperactivity\/hyperconnectivity include the left lateral parietal cortex, right hippocampus and right cerebellum whereas hypoactivity\/hypoconnectivity was observed mainly in the left temporal cortex, the insula, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, lentiform nucleus and thalamus. Results are made available in two different data formats to be used as spatial hypotheses in future studies, particularly for diagnostic classification by MVPA. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMental disorders featuring depression as a predominant symptom and more specifically major depressive disorder (MDD) are important worldwide public health concerns. In recent years significant progress has been achieved regarding the identification of biological correlates and potential neural mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. These scientific efforts comprise studies of genetic foundations, molecular mechanisms including neurotransmitter systems and structural as well as functional neuroimaging (Kupfer et al.,  ). Thereby candidate neural systems have been identified that support emotion processing, reward seeking, regulate emotion and are therefore presumed to play an important role in MDD. These networks include subcortical as well as cortical (particularly prefrontal and cingulate) brain regions modulated by serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission (Kupfer et al.,  ). \n\nA majority of reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in MDD has applied stimulus-based acquisition protocols. Participants were confronted with predefined stimuli in the scanner, e.g., pictures of emotional faces. Brain activity in response to these stimuli was analyzed (Fitzgerald et al.,  ; Stuhrmann et al.,  ; Delvecchio et al.,  ; Diener et al.,  ; Groenewold et al.,  ). Stimulus-based fMRI requires rather complex experimental setups. In contrast, fMRI at rest, so-called resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), facilitates the examination of spontaneous neural activity in networks that highly resemble those observed in task-based fMRI (Smith et al.,  ). It necessitates simpler, but nonetheless highly standardized data acquisition procedures (Van Dijk et al.,  ) and has therefore attracted attention by researchers interested in clinical applications of fMRI (Zhang and Raichle,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Barkhof et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). \n\nA broad methodological spectrum for analyses of rs-fMRI data has been developed and there is no standard analysis strategy for group comparisons either. This heterogeneity is reflected in rs-fMRI studies in MDD as well. However, most analyses are either based on regional features or on connectivity of distant brain regions. Typical regional measures include regional homogeneity (ReHo) or the (fractional) amplitude of characteristic low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF or fALFF). Functional connectivity (FC) can be operationalized as the temporal correlation of signal fluctuations in remote brain areas. Conventional FC-analyses are seed-based but FC-analyses in a wider sense include independent component analyses or complex graph theoretical network measures. A minority of studies has applied analyses of effective connectivity (such as Granger causality taking temporal dependencies into account) (Margulies et al.,  ; van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ). Rs-fMRI is increasingly adopted scientifically in subjects with MDD (Wang et al.,  ; K\u00fchn and Gallinat,  ). Despite the qualitative similarity of networks observed during task-fMRI and rs-fMRI it has not been firmly established which features of stimulus-related neural correlates of MDD can be sufficiently captured by rs-fMRI. The exact relation of rs-fMRI and other neuroimaging methods at rest including positron emission tomography (PET) is still subject to ongoing research as well (Chetelat et al.,  ; Riedl et al.,  ). \n\nWhereas most neuroimaging studies in MDD focus on disease mechanisms at the group level, there is substantial interest in identifying biomarkers that are clinically applicable as diagnostic tools in single subjects (Mossner et al.,  ; Atluri et al.,  ; Schneider and Prvulovic,  ). Particularly, important recent approaches for diagnostic classification in various mental disorders are based on the combination of rs-fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis techniques (MVPA) (Kl\u00f6ppel et al.,  ; Orru et al.,  ; Zarogianni et al.,  ; Haller et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). MVPA subserves the automated generation of decision rules based on previous experience, labeled training data in this particular case. MVPA approaches integrate information from multiple brain regions with the aim to increase diagnostic power compared to conventional univariate analysis schemes that are used in many fMRI studies (Pereira et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). Seminal work in the field of exploring the clinical applicability of rs-fMRI in combination with MVPA has been done in subjects with MDD (Craddock et al.,  ). \n\nFunctional neuroimaging data are typically rather noisy and high-dimensional. Therefore, different feature selection (FS) methods have been proposed to identify a subset of most informative features to be used with the aim to increase classification accuracy (Pereira et al.,  ). There is a fundamental distinction between FS approaches using prior knowledge (Chu et al.,  ) and data-driven methods, particularly filters or wrappers, that use the training dataset itself for FS (Pereira et al.,  ; Mwangi et al.,  ). Recent evidence from structural neuroimaging in dementia indicates that FS based on prior knowledge may be advantageous. In that report support vector machines (SVM) were used for classification (Chu et al.,  ). Such kernel methods like SVM are especially popular in recent attempts to classify fMRI datasets (Orru et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). \n\nThere seems to be a substantive body of scientific studies on rs-fMRI in MDD now. However, methods of data analysis and results are very heterogeneous. Previous efforts to specifically summarize these rs-fMRI findings have focused on specificity and interpretability regarding disease mechanisms and therefore conducted rather exclusive study selection (only five rs-fMRI studies finally included) and pooled studies with SPECT and PET data (K\u00fchn and Gallinat,  ) or adopted qualitative methods of data synthesis (Wang et al.,  ). Consequently, they are not optimally suited to select brain areas that contain particularly important information for FS used later to enable clinical differentiation in MDD by MVPA. \n\nPurpose of this meta-analysis is to consolidate spatial information about alterations of spontaneous brain activity in patients with unipolar depression compared to healthy controls. This investigation is specifically intended to generate and make available \u201cprior knowledge\u201d that can be readily used as spatial hypotheses in rs-fMRI studies in MDD, particularly studies applying machine-learning methods for diagnostic classification. This includes but is not limited to pre-selection of features for diagnostic MVPA approaches. For this reason spatial precision and sensitivity are priorized over functional interpretability regarding exact disease mechanisms. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Identification and selection of relevant studies \n  \nWe conducted a PubMed ( ) search using the following query on August 20, 2013: (  \u201cdepression\u201d OR \u201cdepressive\u201d) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic\u201d) AND (\u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d OR \u201cresting state\u201d OR \u201cresting-state\u201d  ). \n\nInitially, 183 results were identified. In addition, we also screened a recent review for further papers (Wang et al.,  ) and a prior rather exclusive meta-analysis (K\u00fchn and Gallinat,  ) comprising rs-fMRI alterations in depression. Thereby six additional articles were identified. Titles and abstracts were manually screened twice (by two individuals) for studies (in English language) reporting results on rs-fMRI in adult patients with typical subtypes of unipolar depression (not adolescent, postpartum and late-life depression as well as studies that aimed at investigating a specific comorbidity) compared to healthy controls. Of these 51 studies identified, whole text versions were screened for studies fulfilling these criteria as well as including at least 10 subjects per group and reporting resulting coordinates of group comparisons (depression vs. healthy controls) in either MNI\/ICBM (Mazziotta et al.,  ) or Talairach ( ) space. Thirty Two studies fulfilled these criteria and were therefore included in the final analyses. Studies by the same authors were screened for highly similar demographical characterization of samples and were otherwise considered independent in further analyses based on consensus of all three authors. \n\n\n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nReported maxima coordinates were extracted and, if reported in Talairach space, converted to MNI space using tal2icbm (Lancaster et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). As an exception, coordinates from one study (Lui et al.,  ) were transformed using tal2mni (Brett et al.,  ) as final coordinates in that study had initially been transformed using this method. Coordinates were assigned to two categories based on directionality of findings in order to avoid that clearly opposed findings in the original studies enhance each other in the ALE-analysis: group A comprises findings of decreased long distance or local connectivity (including lower correlation coefficients or lower regional homogeneity) or lower power of typical low frequency fluctuations representing spontaneous neural activity in depression compared to healthy controls and findings without clearly interpretable directionality information (Greicius et al.,  ; Bluhm et al.,  ; Yao et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ,  , ; Veer et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ; Guo et al.,  , ,  , ,  , , ; Hamilton et al.,  ; Lui et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  , ; Ye et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Tang et al.,  ; Zeng et al.,  ). Details of these studies are presented in Table  . Group B represents increased connectivity or low frequency fluctuations in depression compared to controls (Table  ) (Liu et al.,  ,  , ; Sheline et al.,  ; Veer et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ; Guo et al.,  , ,  ,  , ; Hamilton et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Cao et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ; Ye et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ). \n  \n Studies in group A (representing mainly decreased connectivity\/function in depression and ambiguous directionality)  . \n  \n Individual reports are grouped by samples according to potential overlap  . \n\n HC, healthy controls; MDD, major depressive disorder; FC, functional connectivity; ReHo, regional homogeneity; (f)ALFF, (fractional) amplitude of low frequency fluctuations; VMHC, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity; ICA, independent component analysis; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  . \n    \n Studies in group B (representing mainly increased connectivity\/function in depression)  . \n  \n Individual reports are grouped by samples according to potential overlap  . \n\n HC, healthy controls; MDD, major depressive disorder; FC, functional connectivity; ReHo, regional homogeneity; (f)ALFF, (fractional) amplitude of low frequency fluctuations; VMHC, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity; ICA, independent component analysis; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  . \n  \nCoordinate-based meta-analyses were calculated with GingerALE (Research Imaging Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA, version 2.3.1,  ) using the non-additive activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach with coordinates organized by subject group (ALE-S method) to account for non-independent samples (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). ALE-S is an extension of the random effects ALE approach (Eickhoff et al.,  ) that prevents multiple experiments performed by one subject group from cumulatively influencing ALE values. Therefore, a modeled activation map is generated for each subject group independently based on published coordinates in a first step. These maps are then combined in a second step to calculate final ALE values (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Coordinates in group A were assigned to 21, in group B to 17 presumably independent subjects groups as indicated in Tables  ,  . Coordinates were masked using the conservative standard mask in Ginger ALE. 11 locations in group A and 7 locations in group B were located outside the mask while 305 (group A) and 132 (group B) foci remained inside. Study specific smoothing using a Gaussian kernel (group A: FWHM median = 9.17 mm, range 8.88\u20139.57 mm, group B: FWHM median = 9.28 mm, range 8.87\u20139.50 mm) was applied based on the mean sample size per subject group to take different sample sizes into account. Results were thresholded at   p   < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster-based correction with a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < 0.01 (uncorrected) and 1000 permutations (Eickhoff et al.,  ) resulting in a minimum cluster size of 528 mm  in group A and 544 mm  in group B. All analyses were calculated in MNI space. \n\nAnatomical labels were automatically assigned in GingerALE. Visualizations were created using Mango (Research Imaging Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA, version 3.0.4,  ) and a high resolution anatomical template with isotropic voxels in MNI space as distributed with GingerALE. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Decreased or ambiguously altered spontaneous functional connectivity\/activity in MDD \n  \nResults of group A spatially converged mainly in the left superior\/middle temporal gyrus and bilaterally in the insula, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, lentiform nucleus and thalamus. For detailed results see Figures   and Table  . Complete thresholded ALE-maps are made available in NIfTI-1 data format as Supplementary Material. \n  \n Areas of altered functional connectivity\/activity in depression compared to controls  .

We will therefore first discuss how the resulting data can be used in subsequent studies including applications with diagnostic intention. This particularly refers to FS for diagnostic MVPA approaches. \n\nAdditionally, subordinate aspects related to the results will be discussed: this study is not primarily designed to elucidate the exact functional nature of alterations of spontaneous brain activity. However, in order to estimate what aspects of the disease mechanisms may be captured based on our results, it is important to understand how they relate to other neurobiological and particularly neuroimaging findings. Therefore, results will be compared with other functional imaging approaches and with findings from structural neuroimaging. \n\n### Potential applications \n  \nResults presented here can be treated as accessible prior knowledge about spatial locations of altered spontaneous brain activity in MDD. In particular this includes definition of regions of interest (ROIs) for hypothesis-driven group comparisons and particularly for FS (Pereira et al.,  ; Chu et al.,  ; Mwangi et al.,  ) in diagnostic classification efforts based on rs-fMRI data. For approaches using correlation based on seeds or pairs of regions of interest (Margulies et al.,  ), coordinates from Tables  ,   can be used directly. In addition, most software tools for voxel-based classification facilitate masking for FS (Schrouff et al.,  ). Therefore, NIfTI-files of thresholded ALE-maps in MNI space are provided (Supplementary Material). \n\nIn terms of classical RSNs several clusters of altered FC in MDD observed here correspond either to well-known midline structures as DMN subregions (Fox et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ) or lateral frontal areas within a fronto-parietal network (Smith et al.,  ) associated with cognitive control (Niendam et al.,  ). It is therefore conceivable to use representations of established functional networks in the brain instead of the original results with the intention to enhance biological plausibility of analyses. Classical resting state networks (RSNs) cannot be quantitatively related to results of this meta-analysis with sufficient validity. Neither one of these single networks seems to comprehend \u201call\u201d major meta-analytical findings nor do these point toward all major subregions of these networks in a qualitative comparison (see Supplementary Material for further details) despite the good correspondence of several single regions. Results may thus rather represent interactions between classical RSNs. \n\nAn exploratory qualitative comparison with spatial representations of recently introduced temporally independent functional modes (TFMs) of spontaneous brain activtiy (Smith et al.,  ) indicates a potentially better correspondence with meta-analytical results (Supplementary Material). However, we do not recommend selecting features for diagnostic classification in MDD based on single RSNs or TFMs at this point because there is only limited evidence for this available so far. This issue warrants further research. \n\nTo summarize, this analyses provides results intended to improve conceivable diagnostic classification approaches. But one should keep in mind that it cannot be concluded from the results that rs-fMRI will be clinically applicable in MDD. \n\n\n### Comparison of results with additional neurobiological findings in MDD \n  \n#### Functional neuroimaging and functional implications \n  \nSeveral studies of rs-fMRI in MDD did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, mostly because of missing coordinate data, but relate to the main meta-analytic findings. Outstanding examples of these studies are discussed here: in a study using independent component analyses (ICA) (Li et al.,  ) a distinction of the DMN into an anterior and a posterior component was addressed. Both showed increased FC before treatment. Differences in the posterior DMN were normalized after antidepressant treatment, while abnormal FC persisted within the anterior DMN (Li et al.,  ). This distinction potentially relates to the fact that only one of these components was significantly identified across studies. Zhang et al. adopted graph theoretical measures to study the topological organization on networks in MDD. Patients exhibited increased nodal centralities, predominately in the caudate nucleus and DMN as well as reduced nodal centralities in occipital, orbitofrontal and temporal regions (Zhang et al.,  ). In another recent rs-fMRI study, published after the date of study identification for this analysis, Sambataro et al. also highlight a differential involvement of DMN subsystems in MDD: patients exhibited increased connectivity of ventral, posterior and core DMN components. The interplay from the anterior to the ventral DMN subsystems was reduced (Sambataro et al.,  ). These findings are in line with meta-analytically observed increases in spontaneous activity in some but not all DMN subregions. \n\nBrain activity at rest has also been studied using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (Fitzgerald et al.,  ; Hamilton et al.,  ; Sacher et al.,  ). In contrast to rs-fMRI analyses these studies rarely adopt FC measures. In an ALE meta-analysis Fitzgerald et al. report a complex pattern of predominantly frontal alterations of brain activity featuring medial frontal hypoactivity, heterogenous findings regarding directionality of alterations in lateral frontal areas in both cerebral hemispheres and hyperactivity in the thalami (Fitzgerald et al.,  ). There is a fair spatial overlap with rs-fMRI findings but the directionality of alterations is not directly comparable. However, in an exclusive analysis of only four studies using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, regionally increased glucose metabolism was observed near the subgenual ACC (Sacher et al.,  ), an area of increased activity\/connectivity observed by rs-fMRI. As a notable aspect, early results of single PET studies of increased brain activity in MDD in the subgenual ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus as well as the amygdala and less-markedly even medial parietal areas who have substantially informed current integrated neurocircuitry models of mood disorders (Price and Drevets,  ) exhibit a better correspondence with rs-fMRI results than the meta-analytic reports of PET-studies in MDD. Thus, it seems desirable to investigate in further studies if features selected by rs-fMRT itself are better suited than PET-derived features that have been used in previous MVPA studies in MDD, for example (Craddock et al.,  ). However, this issue cannot be finally resolved at the moment as there is no consensus regarding optimal classification algorithms for diagnostic purposes (Sundermann et al.,  ). \n\nGenerally the functional organization of the brain at rest highly resembles networks involved in responding to specific tasks (Smith et al.,  ). Despite a host of task-based fMRI studies in MDD so far, results cannot be summarized in one coherent model. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews on altered emotion and cognition in MDD by task-based neuroimaging exhibit moderate (Fitzgerald et al.,  ; Stuhrmann et al.,  ) or poor (Delvecchio et al.,  ) spatial overlap with findings in rs-fMRI reported here and no consistent alterations of activity in posterior DMN components or the subgenual ACC were reported. Thus, rs-fMRI seems to be better suited to depict these systems presumably involved in MDD pathophysiology. On the other hand, alterations of amygdala activity were not consistently observed in rs-fMRI. It has been highlighted, that even the directionality of amygdala activity is highly dependent on the emotional valence of stimuli (Groenewold et al.,  ). Therefore, this dynamical aspect of potential disease mechanisms in MDD may not be sufficiently captured by potential diagnostic classification efforts based on spontaneous activity only. Thus, relying on amygdala activity diagnostically may complicate the differentiation of patients with anxious comorbidity, which is an important symptom in a subset of patients with MDD (Kupfer et al.,  ). \n\nBased on functional imaging results the involvement of the brain areas mainly altered during wakeful rest in MDD pathogenesis has been discussed as follows: the abnormal interplay of cortical midline structures associated with self-referential processing, emotion-related brain areas and lateral cortical areas related to higher cognitive processing has been functionally interpreted as a correlate of pathologically increased ruminative brooding in MDD. In particular, a reduced top-down inhibition of cortical midline and limbic regions has been discussed (Marchetti et al.,  ; Nejad et al.,  ). \n\nFurther lines of function-related research in MDD focus on genetic and metabolic alterations including neurotransmitters and therapeutic interventions (Kupfer et al.,  ). Findings of this meta-analysis can however not be directly related to these efforts because of the heterogeneity of samples and methods in the original studies. Still, knowledge of general relationships between rs-fMRI and neurotransmitter-systems may help further elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms in MDD in the future (Barkhof et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Structural neuroimaging \n  \nThere are repeated reports about specific regional volume reductions in MDD affecting the basal ganglia, hippocampus, frontal lobe (including the orbitofrontal cortex) and less consistently the cingulate cortex and thalamus (Koolschijn et al.,  ; Lorenzetti et al.,  ; Kempton et al.,  ; Arnone et al.,  ; Sacher et al.,  ). These reported locations, based on anatomical descriptors, resemble a subset of findings in rs-fMRI, a strict formal comparison is not feasible as results were mostly not reported in a common coordinate space. Posterior midline structures, central locations of aberrant spontaneous brain activity in MDD, do not seem to be significantly affected by these volume reductions. \n\nWhite matter microstructure as an important aspect of suspected network pathology in affective disorders has been studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and derivative techniques: reduced anisotropy measures, a potential marker of fiber integrity, were observed in parts of the superior frontal white matter presumed to connect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex with subcortical nuclei (Sexton et al.,  ), the superior longitudinal fasciculus and increased anisotropy in the fronto-occipital fasciculus in MDD (Murphy and Frodl,  ). The subgenual ACC associated with increased spontaneous activity\/connectivity in this meta-analysis was identified as a potential site for therapeutic deep brain stimulation in MDD (Mayberg et al.,  ; Johansen-Berg et al.,  ; Lozano et al.,  ; Coenen et al.,  ). The structural connectivity of this area has been investigated using diffusion imaging as well, demonstrating widely distributed connectivity with frontal, limbic and visceromotor brain regions. An associated connectivity-based parcellation of the perigenual ACC revealed two distinct subdivisions, the pre- and the subgenual ACC (Johansen-Berg et al.,  ). The subgenual ACC observed in this meta-analysis of rs-fMRI data corresponds well with the latter location defined by distinct structural connectivity features (orbitofrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe and through the fornix) (Johansen-Berg et al.,  ). \n\nResults of functional and structural imaging in MDD seem somewhat contradictory: some areas with increased spontaneous activity\/functional connectivity seem to exhibit volume reduction or are served by white matter tracts with decreased anisotropy. Though functional and structural connectivity metrics show mostly concordant variations (Damoiseaux and Greicius,  ; Honey et al.,  ), there are other examples of a similar paradox, e.g., in multiple sclerosis (Hawellek et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Limitations of the current analysis \n  \nThe analysis predominantly provides information about spatial congruency of resting-state fMRI findings in depression. It does, however, not allow estimation of effect sizes. Information about the directionality or further details of mechanisms of supposed alterations of functional connectivity is limited. This is particularly caused by the significant heterogeneity of different post-processing methodologies used in the studies reviewed. While interpretation of directionality in most of these methods is well-established for the so-called default mode network (Van Dijk et al.,  ) this does not necessarily generalize to other networks. The number of studies with highly analogous methods was not sufficiently high to facilitate method-specific meta-analyses with adequate statistical power. \n\nThe ALE-approach adopted here relies on sufficiently reliable studies reporting results in terms of whole brain coordinates. Thus, not every study reporting relevant group comparison results based on rs-fMRI data in MDD could be included for this methodological reason. In seed- or ROI-based analyses (Margulies et al.,  ) the original seed coordinates less strictly reflect the spatial location of potentially associated alterations and could therefore not be included in this coordinate-based analysis. This may limit the sensitivity for alterations in such regions that have been regarded of special importance by the authors of the original studies. The generalizability of results to other samples is also limited by the heterogeneity of samples in the studies included as these range from first-episode medication na\u00efve subjects to treatment resistant patients after multiple depressive episodes. However, the literature currently available does not seem to facilitate a more specific meta-analysis regarding these features yet. As stated above this meta-analysis primarily pursued a methodological goal and therefore emphasized spatial specificity. \n\nAll aforementioned aspects potentially reduce the overall statistical power of this meta-analysis. The number of so-called \u201ccontributing\u201d subject groups\u2014actually the number of subjects groups with coordinates within a resulting cluster is however not a straightforward marker of statistical power in this setting as there is a complex relationship with cluster size. Figures   jointly depict statistically significant results and the distributions of raw ALE values in both groups. This gives an impression of the heterogeneity of the original results in both groups. This heterogeneity implies that alterations of FC or spontaneous brain activity are not a highly robust finding across different samples and methodological choices. This has to be taken into account when trying to make conclusions about actual disease mechanisms based on these results. In contrast to an earlier meta-analysis of rs-fMRI in MDD (K\u00fchn and Gallinat,  ), the main purpose of this study was feature selection for conceivable diagnostic classification by MVPA. To briefly reiterate, this means to identify a set of brain areas that contain potentially discriminative information to differentiate MDD patients from controls. Such feature selection is intended to reduce data dimensionality and discard irrelevant information in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of classification approaches (Pereira et al.,  ; Mwangi et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). Aggregating prior knowledge from the literature is a commonly applied feature selection step (Chu et al.,  ; Schrouff et al.,  ). Type II errors in such a preparatory meta-analysis can be much more problematic than limited type I errors. Missing important brain areas discriminating subjects with MDD from controls might reduce diagnostic accuracy. Owing to the (however not unlimited) ability of classification algorithms to identify and highlight most discriminative information (Pereira et al.,  ), a limited amount of false positive results in the definition of regions of interest or masks could potentially be better compensated for. There is no established standard for setting multiple comparison correction thresholds in ALE analyses yet as it is highly dependent on the number of studies and data distribution (Eickhoff et al.,  ). This issue is however much more problematic in meta-analyses that are primarily intended to elucidate disease mechanisms. \n\nMultiple reports based on the same or similar data and overlapping samples are a generic problem in meta-analyses (Littell et al.,  ). In this work a recent modification of the ALE method (Turkeltaub et al.,  ) was adopted to minimize within-group effects of potentially overlapping samples without sacrificing valuable information. Despite that, it cannot be fully excluded that there is residual overlap of samples in studies considered independent here. However, we adopted a consensus based approach involving three reviewers to reduce this potential bias. \n\nEven despite this issue the recent literature on rs-fMRI in MDD displays a noticeable tendency toward particular Asian as well as North American or European populations. As prevalence and clinical symptomatology differ significantly between cultural contexts (Kirmayer,  ; Halbreich et al.,  ; Juhasz et al.,  ; Yeung and Chang,  ) results reported in this meta-analysis may not necessarily be applicable to other populations. \n\nDue to the different informational content a quantitative comparison with RSNs and TFMs, such as a formal conjunction analysis, was not feasible. \n\nThis meta-analysis focused on comparisons of depressive subjects and healthy controls. However, it seems to be even more desirable to identify differential neuroimaging biomarkers that provide information about individual prognosis or guide therapeutic decisions (Mossner et al.,  ; Sundermann et al.,  ). Feature (pre-)selection for such efforts may be optimized specifically in the future as soon as further rs-fMRI research in these situations becomes available. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis of resting-state fMRI studies in depression has identified a distributed pattern of brain regions with increased or decreased spontaneous activity compared to healthy controls. The most distinct finding is hyperactivity or hyperconnectivity presumably reflecting the interaction of midline structures (particulary posterior DMN components associated with self-referential processing and the subgenual ACC) with lateral frontal areas related to externally-directed cognition. Alterations that can be captured by rs-fMRI seem to differ from those identifiable with other neuroimaging modalities but show considerable overlap. Results of this meta-analysis are provided as coordinates and detailed maps in MNI space to be readily applicable for ROI selection in further rs-fMRI studies in MDD including feature selection for classification approaches with diagnostic intention. By emphasizing spatial precision and sensitivity this approach only provides limited information about the exact functional meaning of altered spontaneous brain activity in MDD. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nBenedikt Sundermann and Bettina Pfleiderer conceived and designed the study.

However, the number and boundaries of distinct functional regions remain to be determined. Here, we present new evidence, from meta-analysis of a large number of positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, of different functional specificity in the left STS supporting a division of its middle to terminal extent into at least three functional areas. The middle portion of the left STS stem (  f  mSTS) is highly specialized for speech perception and the processing of language material. The posterior portion of the left STS stem (  f  pSTS) is highly versatile and involved in multiple functions supporting semantic memory and associative thinking. The   f  pSTS responds to both language and non-language stimuli but the sensitivity to non-language material is greater. The horizontal portion of the left STS stem and terminal ascending branches (  f  tSTS) display intermediate functional specificity, with the anterior-dorsal ascending branch (  f  atSTS) supporting executive functions and motor planning and showing greater sensitivity to language material, and the horizontal stem and posterior-ventral ascending branch (  f  ptSTS) supporting primarily semantic processing and displaying greater sensitivity to non-language material. We suggest that the high functional specificity of the left   f  mSTS for speech is an important means by which the human brain achieves exquisite affinity and efficiency for native speech perception. In contrast, the extreme multi-functionality of the left   f  pSTS reflects the role of this area as a cortical hub for semantic processing and the extraction of meaning from multiple sources of information. Finally, in the left   f  tSTS, further functional differentiation between the dorsal and ventral aspect is warranted. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe human superior temporal sulci occupy an important fraction of the temporal cortex, strategically located at the junction of major temporal\u2014parietal and\u2014frontal functional pathways. Portions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in each hemisphere have been assigned numerous specialized perceptual and cognitive functions (Hein and Knight,  ). Given the size and orientation of the STS, a division along its anterior-to-posterior axis is predicted, but determination of the functional boundaries remains hotly debated. Anatomically, the STS in each hemisphere has been divided into a forward stem composed of an anterior, a middle, a posterior and an horizontal segment, and a backward ascending branch bifurcated into an anterior-dorsal and a posterior-ventral segment, based on 3D morphology and ontogenic observations (Ochiai et al.,  ). In the left hemisphere, structural and functional connectivity patterns to the inferior frontal cortex support a division of the superior temporal cortex into at least two, and perhaps three, segments that are part of functionally distinct anterior-ventral and posterior-dorsal streams for language processing (Frey et al.,  ; Saur et al.,  ; Rauschecker and Scott,  ; Rauschecker,  ; Turken and Dronkers,  ), reminiscent of the dual stream model of auditory perception (Rauschecker and Tian,  ). Functional neuroimaging data also suggests that the left STS can be divided along its anterior-to-posterior axis, with the left middle STS consistently associated with speech perception (Liebenthal et al.,  ; Obleser et al.,  ; Leaver and Rauschecker,  ; DeWitt and Rauschecker,  ) and more posterior areas associated with multiple functions including semantic processing (Dronkers et al.,  ), audiovisual integration (Calvert et al.,  ; Beauchamp,  ), biological motion processing (Puce et al.,  ) and phonological processing (Wise et al.,  ; Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Liebenthal et al.,  ,  ). However, the different functions associated with different portion of the left STS have seldom been localized and compared within the same set of subjects and experimental framework. Previous studies of the STS have compared pairs of similar functions within a cognitive domain, such as for example voice and speech recognition (Belin et al.,  ), speech perception and phonological processing (Liebenthal et al.,  ), or auditory, visual and somatosensory integration (Beauchamp et al.,  ). But, to our knowledge, systematic functional comparisons have not been carried out between multiple functions across cognitive domains (for example, between several language and non-language functions). As a result, the number and boundaries of distinct functional regions in the left STS remain to be determined. \n\nDespite a remarkable growth in neuroimaging research in recent years, another persistent limitation to understanding the neuroanatomical organization of cognitive functions is that most studies rely on relatively small sample sizes and narrow experimental designs (i.e., a restricted number of experimental conditions). This is problematic because of the well-known inter-individual variability in brain structure, brain function, and brain structure-function relationships, including in the STS (Sowell et al.,  ; Kanai et al.,  ; Gilaie-Dotan et al.,  ). Particularly in the terminal aspect of the STS, the number of ascending branches and how they join the STS stem was found to be highly variable between individuals, causing irregularity in naming convention and contributing to the murkiness in functional characterization of this area (Segal and Petrides,  ). Further challenging the characterization of terminal STS is the high degree of variability in the neighboring inferior parietal lobule (IPL), where the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and angular gyrus (AG) were found to be composed of several distinct cytoarchitectural areas, suggestive of functional differentiation, with no consistent correspondence between cytoarchitectural and macroanatomical borders (Caspers et al.,  ). It is therefore valuable to examine brain activation patterns   across   neuroimaging studies in order to identify reliable functional organization principles in larger subject samples and in a wide array of cognitive paradigms. \n\nPrevious meta-analyses involving the temporal cortex have most often centered on one specific cognitive function, for example speech perception (Turkeltaub and Coslett,  ), semantic processing (Binder et al.,  ; Adank,  ), auditory attention (Alho et al.,  ), writing (Purcell et al.,  ; Planton et al.,  ), motion perception (Grosbras et al.,  ), emotion processing (Lee and Siegle,  ), and theory of mind (Van Overwalle and Baetens,  ). One prior meta-analysis focused on the multi functionality of the STS, but was limited to just a few studies per functional category that used similar stimuli and experimental designs (Hein and Knight,  ). \n\nThe present meta-analysis was designed to study the functional organization of the left STS for language and non-language processing. The meta-analysis deliberately included a large number of studies using different neuroimaging methods (PET, fMRI), experimental designs (implicit, explicit, or no task), and stimuli (linguistic, nonlinguistic). The extent of the left STS was determined based on a probabilistic map created from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images of 61 brains. We reasoned that (1) drawing from commonalities in activation across multiple data sets generated using different experimental designs and methodologies would highlight reliable and fundamental functional organization patterns; and (2) defining the extent of the STS and a comprehensive set of putative STS functional categories would serve as a unifying platform for analyzing results from multiple studies, irrespective of anatomical labeling practices and interpretation of functional activation patterns across the studies. The reported results rely on analysis of 485 activation peaks from 253 studies that fell within the left STS mask. The peaks were sorted into 2 stimulus categories and 15 functional categories based on the experimental contrast used to generate each activation map. The main results are reported in terms of functional specificity, expressed as the number of stimulus and functional categories with a significant mean activation likelihood estimate, in different areas of the left STS. Structural subdivisions of the STS are labeled using an approximation of the demarcation of Ochiai et al. ( ), as detailed schematically in Figure  . Note that the anterior-dorsal ascending branch of the terminal STS (atSTS) is immediately posterior to the ascending branch of the Sylvian fissure. The atSTS is expected in most brains to be anterior to the first intermediate sulcus of Jensen, which (when present) is considered to form the boundary between the SMG and AG (Caspers et al.,  ; Segal and Petrides,  ). As such, the atSTS terminates in most brains within the posterior SMG, near the boundary with AG. The posterior-ventral branch of the terminal STS (ptSTS) terminates within the AG. \n  \n Left STS probabilistic mask and ROIs. (A)   Probabilistic mask of the left STS (in red) shown projected onto a cortical surface model of the Colin brain in Talairach space. Also shown is a schematic approximation of the STS anatomical subdivisions used to describe the results (based on Ochiai et al.,  ), consisting of the aSTS, anterior STS; mSTS, middle STS; pSTS, posterior STS; hSTS, horizontal STS; atSTS, anterior branch of terminal STS; and ptSTS, posterior branch of terminal STS;   (B)   twenty evenly spaced spherical ROIs in the left STS, in which functional specificity was probed, shown projected onto the same cortical surface. The ROIs are numbered in ascending order according to their anterior-posterior position along the left STS. \n  \n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nA probabilistic map of the left STS was created by averaging two T1-weighted MR images from each of 61 brains, in which the STS had been demarcated using Freesurfer (Dale et al.,  ) for automatic parcellation of sulci and gyri (Destrieux et al.,  ). The resulting STS atlas (labeled TT_desai_ddpmaps) is included with AFNI (Cox,  ). The left STS probabilistic map was thresholded at 20% probability and extended 5 mm laterally to create a mask for the meta-analysis (Figure  ). Note that the STS, as parcellated in the Destrieux et al. atlas, broadens toward the posterior end and arguably includes parts of the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), AG, and possibly SMG. We chose to use the same parcellation for consistency and to ensure adequate sampling of activation in the terminal STS. \n\nIn the BrainMap database (Laird et al.,  ), 675 PET and fMRI studies published in the years 1990\u20132010 were identified that reported activation peaks located within the left STS mask, as assessed based on reported coordinates in Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). From these, 485 activation peaks from 253 different studies meeting the inclusion criteria of representing data collected from a group of at least 8 healthy adults of mixed gender, and using a high-level baseline, were incorporated in the meta-analysis. Functional contrasts using a low-level baseline, such as fixation or rest, were excluded due to the uncertainty associated with the nature of activations in such comparisons. \n\nEach activation peak was categorized according to the type of stimulus material and the functional contrast used to generate the activation. The stimulus categories consisted of \u201clanguage\u201d (including auditory and visual spoken, or written, sub-syllabic, syllabic, word, sentence or discourse stimuli) and \u201cnon-language\u201d (including all types of non-verbal and non-written stimuli not included in the language category). The functional categories consisted of 15 sensory, motor, or cognitive processes most commonly targeted by the condition contrasts used to generate the peaks included in the meta-analysis. The functional categories were further classified as linguistic or non-linguistic for the purpose of comparing each functional category with the other categories in its class. The complete list of stimulus and functional categories, and functional classes, is given in Table  . \n  \n Stimulus and functional categories used to sort the left STS activation peaks  . \n  \nEach activation peak was categorized according to the type of stimulus material (language or non-language, in pink or orange shading, respectively) and function (sensory, motor, and cognitive) engaged in the \u201chigh\u201d (of interest) relative to \u201clow\u201d (baseline) condition of the experimental contrast. The functional categories were further classified as linguistic (gray shading) or non-linguistic (blue shading) for the purpose of comparing each functional category with the other categories in its class (in Figures  ,  ). The number of peaks analyzed in each stimulus and functional category in also reported. \n  \nPeaks were assigned to a stimulus category based on the input material used in the \u201chigh\u201d (of interest) compared to \u201clow\u201d (baseline) condition of the experimental contrast, and to up to three different functional categories representing the main sensory, motor, or cognitive functions considered to be engaged in the \u201chigh\u201d relative to \u201clow\u201d condition of the contrast. For example, an activation peak resulting from a perceptual contrast of clear spoken sentences and non-intelligible speech-like sounds would be assigned to the language stimulus category and to the functional categories of speech perception, semantic processing, and syntactic processing. There were 271 and 223 peaks assigned to the language and non-language stimulus categories, respectively. Sixteen peaks were assigned to both the Language and Non-Language stimulus categories. These peaks resulted from contrasts in which the stimuli used in the \u201chigh\u201d condition contained both linguistic and non-linguistic information that was not balanced by the stimuli used in the \u201clow\u201d condition. For example, some studies of audiovisual speech perception compared a video clip of a face producing natural speech with a series of stilled frames of the face showing apical gestures (Calvert and Campbell,  ). The differential activation in this contrast was considered to reflect the higher linguistic (speech) and non-linguistic (biological motion) content of the stimuli in the \u201chigh\u201d condition. Seven peaks were not assigned to either Language or Non-language stimulus categories. These peaks resulted from contrasts in which no stimulus was used in the \u201chigh\u201d condition. For example, some studies compared an internal task such as imagination, in which no external stimulus was used, with a perceptual task (Kosslyn et al.,  ). Such peaks were assigned to functional categories and were included in comparisons between functional (but not stimulus) categories. The number of peaks assigned to each functional category (reported in Table  ) ranged 14\u2013118 (mean = 37), with \u201csemantic processing\u201d as the largest category. The degree of overlap in peak assignment between pairs of functional categories ranged 0.03\u20130.52 (mean = 0.23), with the largest overlap occurring between \u201corthographic processing\u201d and \u201csemantic processing.\u201d \n\nThe GingerALE version 2.0.4 application of the BrainMap software was used to perform the meta-analysis, with fixed 10 mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ). The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique estimates the convergence of neuroimaging activation foci by modeling them as Gaussian probability distributions based on assessment of spatial uncertainty due to intersubject and co-registration variability. A relatively low and fixed (i.e., not adjusted according to study sample size) level of smoothing was used in order to maintain sensitivity to potential small subdivisions within the STS and to avoid potential bias from systematic differences in study sample sizes across functional categories. The ALE in the two stimulus categories was compared (Figure  ). The ALE in each functional category was compared with the ALE in   all   other functional categories in the same class (Figure  ), and also with the ALE in   each   of the other functional categories in the same class in a pairwise fashion (Figure  ), where class was defined as language or non-language (see Table  ). The ALE category contrast maps for the entire left STS were thresholded at   p   < 0.01 and clusters smaller than 700 \u03bcl were removed, resulting in a corrected error probability of \u03b1 < 0.05, as determined using the AlphaSim module in AFNI (Ward,  ). \n  \n ALE contrast maps.   Contrast maps of   (A)   the two stimulus categories and   (B)   each functional category relative to all the other functional categories in the same class. Maps are thresholded at a corrected probability of \u03b1 < 0.05. Only functional contrasts resulting in significant differential ALE measurement in the left STS are displayed. \n    \n ALE outline maps.   Outline maps of pairs of functional categories in the language   (A)   and the non-language   (B)   functional classes that showed significant differences in activation likelihood in the left STS at a corrected error probability of \u03b1 < 0.05. \n  \nIn a second analysis, the functional organization of the left STS was studied in finer grain by using a region of interest (ROI) approach. The left STS mask was divided into twenty ROIs. Because the geometry of the STS does not follow a straight line, we used a clustering algorithm to partition the left STS mask into twenty sub-regions that were approximately equal-sized and evenly spaced. This was accomplished by submitting the x, y, z coordinates of all the voxels in the mask to a k-means clustering algorithm set to identify twenty clusters. The cluster center coordinates were then used as the center positions of twenty 4 mm-radius spherical ROIs. The location of ROIs within the left STS mask is shown in Figure  . The mean ALE (expressed in   z  -scores) within each ROI was calculated for each functional category. The functional specificity of each ROI was estimated by tallying the number of categories activating this region at   p   < 0.005 (  z   > 2.807). Results of the ROI analyses are shown in Figures  ,  . \n  \n ROI mean ALE functional measure.   Graph of mean ALE measure within each ROI for each functional category exceeding the significance level (mean   z   = 2.807,   p   < 0.005). The categories are stacked according to functional class, with the language functional categories on the bottom in shades of blue, and the non-language functional categories on the top in shades of red and orange. The ROIs are ordered from the most anterior (ROI 1) to the most posterior (ROI 20) along the STS (see Figure   for the anatomical location of each ROI). The vertical dashed lines show locations of marked changes in functional specificity. \n    \n Partition of left STS into three subdivisions based on functional specificity.   The number label within each ROI represents its functional specificity, expressed as the number of functional categories with a significant mean ALE measure in this region (  p   < 0.005). The functional mSTS (  f  mSTS) subdivision was defined as a region activated by a small number of functional categories (range 1\u20134, mean 2.6), the functional pSTS (  f  pSTS) subdivision was defined as a region activated by the largest number of functional categories (range 8\u201314, mean 11), and the functional tSTS (  f  tSTS) subdivision was defined as a region activated by an intermediate number of functional categories (range 4\u20136, mean 4.7). The three graphs show the mean ALE measure (expressed in Z-scores) for each stimulus (in red) and functional (in blue) category in descending order of magnitude, in the ROIs that were activated by the largest number of functional categories in each subdivision (ROIs number 4, 9, and 17 in the left   f  mSTS,   f  pSTS, and   f  tSTS, respectively). The horizontal line corresponds to   z   = 2.807 (  p   < 0.005). \n  \nThe cortical inflated surfaces in Figure   were rendered using Caret 5.62 (Van Essen et al.,  ). The surfaces in the other figures were rendered using custom code in Matlab (Matlab 7.1, The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe contrast between the two stimulus categories (Figure  ) showed a greater likelihood of language compared to non-language activation peaks in most of the left STS, except in the posterior and horizontal STS stem (pSTS and hSTS, respectively) where a greater likelihood of non-language activation peaks was observed. The contrasts between each functional category in the language class and all the other categories in that class (Figure  , left panels) revealed significantly greater likelihood of speech perception peaks in the middle STS stem (mSTS), and of semantic processing peaks in pSTS and hSTS. The contrasts between each functional category in the non-language class and all the other categories in that class (Figure  , right panels) revealed significantly greater likelihood of emotion processing peaks in pSTS, and of executive processing peaks in the anterior terminal STS branch (atSTS). The non-language area in the stimulus contrast (Figure  ) overlapped considerably with the semantic and emotion areas in the functional contrasts (Figure  ). Pairwise comparisons between the functional categories in each class (Figure  ) revealed greater likelihood of speech perception peaks in mSTS relative to greater likelihood of speech production peaks in the anterior (atSTS) and posterior (ptSTS) terminal STS branches, as well as greater likelihood of auditory perception peaks in mSTS relative to greater likelihood of visual perception peaks in pSTS and hSTS. Other functional contrasts resulted in no significant differences (\u03b1 < 0.05). \n\nThe ROI analysis revealed the functional properties of the left STS with greater spatial detail. The mean ALE within each ROI, for each of the functional categories is plotted in Figure  . Several interesting observations arise from this analysis. The most anterior ROIs (numbered 2\u20136) show significant activation likelihood for just a few functional categories (range 1\u20134, mean 2.6) largely from the language class (in shades of blue). The ROIs in intermediate position (numbered 7\u201313) show significant activation likelihood for the largest number of functional categories (range 8\u201314, mean 11) from both the language and non-language classes (the latter in shades of red and orange). The ROIs in the most posterior part of the left STS (numbered 14\u201320) show significant activation likelihood for an intermediate number of functional categories (range 4\u20136, mean 4.7) from both the language and non-language classes. The difference in functional specificity (expressed as the number of functional categories with a significant mean ALE measure) between the three regions is significant [One-Way ANOVA,   F   = 43,   p   = 0]. Anatomically, the anterior ROIs (2\u20136) correspond roughly to the mSTS stem area, the intermediate ROIs (7\u201313) correspond roughly to the pSTS stem area, and the most posterior ROIs correspond roughly to the hSTS stem area and the atSTS and ptSTS branches. Note that in ROI 1, none of the categories survived the statistical threshold, likely due to a small number of activation peaks falling within this area. \n\nBased on these differences in functional specificity, we propose a division of the left STS into middle, posterior and terminal functional areas, labeled respectively   f  mSTS (talairach y coordinates \u22127 to \u221227),   f  pSTS (talairach y coordinates \u221228 to \u221259), and   f  tSTS (talairach y coordinates \u221255 to \u221271). Figure   shows an approximate demarcation of the three functional areas and their specificity, as well as plots of the mean ALE measure for each stimulus and functional category in the ROIs activated by the largest number of functional categories (i.e., the least specific ROIs) in each sub-division. In the   f  mSTS, the least functionally specific ROI (number 4) showed significant activation likelihood only for language stimuli, and only for the speech perception, and phonological, auditory, and semantic processing functional categories. In the   f  pSTS, the least specific ROI (number 9) showed significant activation likelihood for both language and non-language stimuli, and for 14 out of the 15 possible functional categories (with the exception of executive control). In the   f  tSTS, the least functionally specific ROI (number 17) showed significant activation likelihood for both language and non-language stimuli, and for the executive and motor control, memory, speech production, and syntactic and visual processing functional categories. \n\nWith regard to   f  tSTS, despite the similar level of functional specificity across this area, we expect that it is composed of an anterior and a posterior subdivision (  f  atSTS and   f  ptSTS, respectively), based on its irregular 3D anatomy and apparent dichotomous functionality related primarily to executive control in atSTS and to semantic processing in hSTS and ptSTS (see Figure  ). \n\nSeveral potential limitations should be mentioned with respect to the results. First, the Brainmap database is not a random sample of the neuroimaging literature and may be biased toward studies of certain cognitive functions. For example, the smaller number of studies of speech perception (42) compared to studies of semantic processing (118) found here with peaks falling in the left STS may reflect a sampling bias in the database or a true aspect of STS functional organization. Seconds, the distribution of number of peaks analyzed was not even along the left STS, with fewer peaks falling in the mSTS area (66) and more peaks falling in the pSTS (224) and tSTS (195) areas. Importantly, the difference in the distribution of the number of peaks along the STS cannot in itself explain the higher functional specificity of the mSTS because the distribution of the number of peaks was not random with respect to functional and stimulus category. That is, not all the stimulus and functional categories were evenly less represented in mSTS relative to pSTS and tSTS. On the contrary, a small number of categories were actually better represented in mSTS than in the rest of the STS. In particular, the category of speech perception had higher ALE values than all of the other language categories combined specifically in mSTS (Figure  ), and the mSTS showed higher ALE values for Language over Non-Language stimuli (Figure  ). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe present here new evidence from meta-analysis of a large number of PET and fMRI studies, of different functional specificity along the left STS supporting a division of its middle to terminal extent into at least three functionally distinct areas. Based on the present results, and a review of the literature, we suggest that a functional area in the left middle STS (  f  mSTS; Talairach y coordinates \u22127 to \u221227) is highly specialized for speech perception and the processing of language material. A functional area in the left posterior STS (  f  pSTS; Talairach y coordinates \u221228 to \u221259) is highly versatile and serves as a hub for semantic processing and multiple functions supporting semantic memory and associative thinking. The   f  pSTS responds to both language and non-language stimuli but the likelihood of response to non-language material is greater. A functional area including the left horizontal and terminal STS (  f  tSTS; Talairach y coordinates \u221255 to \u221271) displays intermediate functional specificity, with the anterior ascending branch adjoining SMG (  f  atSTS) supporting executive functions and motor planning and showing greater likelihood of response to language material, and the horizontal stem and posterior ascending branch adjoining AG (  f  ptSTS) supporting primarily semantic processing and displaying greater likelihood of response to non-language material. These latter results in the   f  tSTS suggest that a further functional differentiation between its dorsal and ventral aspect is warranted. \n\nThe finding of a strong convergence of activity related to speech processing in the left   f  mSTS is largely consistent with prior neural functional models associating this area with phonemic perception (Davis and Johnsrude,  ; Liebenthal et al.,  ; Obleser et al.,  ; Leaver and Rauschecker,  ; DeWitt and Rauschecker,  ). The left mSTS is considered to be part of a ventral auditory pathway for speech recognition, connecting the auditory cortex to semantic regions widely distributed in the left middle and inferior temporal cortex. Neurons in the left mSTS may be specially tuned to the categorical properties of native speech phonemes (Liebenthal et al.,  ; Leaver and Rauschecker,  ; Humphries et al.,  ) making this area critical for decoding incoming speech signals. The most novel and striking aspect of the current results is the narrow functional specificity of the left   f  mSTS, observed as significant preference to language over non-language stimuli and to speech perception over other language functions (Figures  ,  ), as well as the convergence of peaks from only a few functional categories mostly in the language class (Figures  ,  ), in this area. It is possible that the high functional specificity of the left   f  mSTS for speech is an important means by which the human brain achieves its exquisite affinity and efficiency for native speech perception. The anatomical proximity of the mSTS to auditory cortex, and higher sensitivity of this region to auditory over visual processing (Figure  ), are also consistent with a specialization in this area for speech perception over other (non-auditory based) language functions. \n\nThe finding of a strong convergence of activity related to semantic processing in the left   f  pSTS is consistent with prior work indicating the importance of the adjacent left posterior MTG (pMTG) to language comprehension (Price,  ,  ; Dronkers et al.,  ; Binder et al.,  ). Lesions in the left pMTG are known to be particularly detrimental to language comprehension (Boatman et al.,  ; Dronkers et al.,  ; Baldo et al.,  ). The left posterior superior temporal cortex is activated during language comprehension irrespective of the input modality, including during sign language processing in native signers (Bavelier et al.,  ; MacSweeney et al.,  ). The main novel aspect of the present results is again related to functional specificity, which was astonishingly low in the left   f  pSTS and in sharp contrast to the high functional specificity observed in the left   f  mSTS. The left   f  pSTS was found to be extremely multi-functional, being more likely to respond to non-language stimuli, during semantic and emotion processing over other language and non-language functions, respectively (Figure  ); but also likely to respond to language stimuli and to almost all other functional categories (Figures  ,  ). The observation that an area \u201cspecializing\u201d in semantic processing is overall more responsive to non-linguistic (i.e., non-verbal and non-written) stimuli is perhaps not intuitive. However, this finding is consistent with the idea that the very nature of semantic processing involves association of input from the different senses, analyzed in various ways (e.g., sensory features, biological motion, emotional valence, etc\u2026), to extract information relevant to object recognition and comprehension. The extreme multi-functionality of the left   f  pSTS may reflect the role of this area as a cortical hub for semantic processing and the extraction of meaning from multiple sources of information. The strategic location of the left   f  pSTS, at the confluence of auditory and visual afferent streams, and fronto-parietal somato-motor and executive control efferent streams, is ideal for a cortical hub, in line with the concept of a neural convergence zone (Damasio,  ; Meyer and Damasio,  ) or epicenter (Mesulam,  ,  ). \n\nThe finding of a mixed pattern of functionality in the left   f  tSTS is perhaps not surprising given the complex anatomy of this area and varied functionality of bordering areas. The atSTS branch terminates near the SMG, an area suggested to serve as an auditory-motor interface (Guenther et al.,  ; Hickok and Poeppel,  ), whereas the ptSTS branch terminates into the AG, an area associated primarily with semantic processing (Binder et al.,  ; Price,  ). The preference observed here of the left   f  atSTS for language stimuli and executive and motor control functions (Figures  ,  ) is well in line with the implication of this and the neighboring SMG area in phonological processing (Paulesu et al.,  ; Caplan et al.,  ; Wise et al.,  ; Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Buchsbaum and D'Esposito,  ; Liebenthal et al.,  ) and the learning of ambiguous or non-native sound categories (Callan et al.,  ; Golestani and Zatorre,  ; Raizada and Poldrack,  ; Desai et al.,  ; Liebenthal et al.,  ; Kilian-Hutten et al.,  ). The   f  atSTS may be important for maintenance of auditory sequences in short-term memory while their auditory, somatosensory, and motor properties are analyzed to support phonemic perception. In contrast, the preference observed here of the left   f  ptSTS for non-language stimuli and semantic processing bears resemblance to the preference of the nearby   f  pSTS area, and is well in line with the implication of the AG in semantic retrieval and semantic integration (Price,  ,  ; Dronkers et al.,  ; Binder et al.,  ; Binder and Desai,  ; Bonner et al.,  ). The left   f  ptSTS area could be an extension of the left   f  pSTS semantic area identified here and a functional bridge to the AG. Taken together, these results support a functional differentiation between the anterior-dorsal and posterior-ventral aspects of tSTS, in line with the different role of dorsal and ventral portions of the IPL. Nevertheless, given the documented high intersubject variability in terminal STS, caution should be used in treating differences in activation within this area and with the adjacent IPL. The functional differentiation within terminal STS should be addressed further in future work, perhaps taking into account cyoarchitectural information. \n\nStructural connectivity and resting state functional connectivity patterns in the left temporal cortex are also in line with a left STS anterior-to-posterior segregation based on functional specificity. Disparate language pathways are thought to connect the left middle and posterior superior temporal cortex with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), consistent with ventral and dorsal streams of processing for language (Saur et al.,  ; Rauschecker and Scott,  ; Rauschecker,  ). Structural connectivity measured with diffusion tensor imaging showed that the middle superior temporal cortex is connected to the anterior IFG via the ventral portion of the extreme capsule fiber system and also via the uncinate fasciculus. In contrast, the posterior superior temporal cortex is connected to the posterior IFG directly via the arcuate fasciculus, and also indirectly through the inferior parietal cortex via the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Catani et al.,  ; Parker et al.,  ; Anwander et al.,  ; Frey et al.,  ). The left pMTG was found to have particularly rich structural connections with other brains areas through several major pathways connecting it to the AG and to the rest of the temporal cortex, in addition to IFG (Turken and Dronkers,  ). Similarly, resting state functional connectivity in the left middle superior temporal cortex was found to be limited to the posterior temporal cortex and the IFG (Turken and Dronkers,  ). In contrast, functional connectivity in the left pMTG was found to be among the highest in the cerebral cortex, with connections to the left AG, anterior STG, and IFG (Buckner et al.,  ; Turken and Dronkers,  ). The locus of most extensive functional connectivity in the left pMTG indicated in the Buckner study (Talairach x, y, z coordinates \u221262, \u221238, \u221212) coincides with the anterior-posterior position of the pSTS area of least functional specificity observed in the present study (ROI 9, Talairach x, y, z coordinates \u221248, \u221239, \u22121). \n\nThe current STS meta-analysis extends that of Hein and Knight ( ) by introducing a new functional specificity measure highlighting the organization of the left STS for language and non-language processing. This new perspective was possible mainly thanks to the much larger number of studies across language and non-language domains analyzed here. In the Hein and Knight study, activation peaks in the speech perception category were clustered in the anterior portion of the STS (approximately corresponding to the mSTS area described here), whereas those for several other categories (multisensory processing, biological motion processing) were clustered in the posterior portion the STS (approximately corresponding to the pSTS and tSTS areas described here) though with a small presence also in the anterior STS. The results were interpreted as different degrees of multi-functionality in the anterior and posterior STS rather than a functional differentiation   per se  , because there was some degree of spatial overlap between functional categories along the entire STS. The present meta-analysis supports the concept of differences in multi-functionality along the STS. But the extreme low multi-functionality in the mSTS and contrastingly extreme high multi-functionality in the adjacent pSTS observed here suggest that there may be fundamental differences between these areas reflecting a true functional specialization for speech perception and semantic processing, respectively, rather than merely a gradient of multi-functionality. \n\nIn conclusion, the present work demonstrated a division of the mid-to-terminal left STS into at least three functional areas based on functional specificity. Future work using a more detailed definition of stimulus and functional categories, as well as finer anatomic parcellation of the STS mask, may yield further insights into the functional organization of left STS and the interaction of each functional subdivision with neighboring regions. A comparison with the functional organization of the right STS is also warranted. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4160993,"text_md5":"244b80ebcef5fc9c3aa8dbf68108a70a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,94],"journal":[95,109],"publication_year":[111,115],"title":[126,240],"keywords":[254,457],"abstract":[470,2452],"body":[2461,39105]},"batch":1,"pmid":25309312,"doi":"10.3389\/fnins.2014.00289","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4160993","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4160993"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4160993\">4160993<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4160993  The functional organization of the left STS: a large scale meta-analysis of PET and fMRI studies of healthy adults"}

In humans, neuroimaging studies of person memory report consistent activations in the ATL to famous and personally familiar faces and studies of patients report resection or damage of the ATL causes an associative prosopagnosia in which face perception is intact but face memory is compromised. In addition, high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates and electrophysiological studies of humans also suggest regions of the ventral ATL are sensitive to novel faces. The current study extends previous findings by investigating whether similar subregions in the dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL are sensitive to personally familiar, famous, and novel faces. We present the results of two studies of person memory: a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies and an empirical fMRI study using optimized imaging parameters. Both studies showed left-lateralized ATL activations to familiar individuals while novel faces activated the right ATL. Activations to famous faces were quite ventral, similar to what has been reported in previous high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates. These findings suggest that face memory-sensitive patches in the human ATL are in the ventral\/polar ATL. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlthough personally known and famous faces are often used interchangeably as \u201cfamiliar\u201d faces, there are distinct differences between them, which have implications on a theoretical and neural level. Personally familiar faces are associated with richer and more extensive first-person semantic and episodic knowledge than famous faces, as well as greater and more nuanced emotional significance (Sugiura et al.,  ), whereas famous faces are defined by their unique semantic attributes such as having starred in a popular movie or having served as president of the United States (Ross and Olson,  ). fMRI studies of person memory have most commonly contrasted famous faces to unfamiliar faces and one of the most consistently reported activations is in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL); see Leveroni et al.,  ; Henson et al.,  ; Gobbini et al.,  ; Eger et al.,  ; Elfgren et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ; Brambati et al.,  ; Nielson et al.,  ; Ramon et al.,  ; Barense et al.,  ; Cloutier et al.,  ; Gesierich et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ; Sugiura et al.,  . These fMRI findings extend earlier PET studies reporting ATL activations to famous faces (Sergent et al.,  , ; Gorno-Tempini et al.,  ,  ; Dubois et al.,  ; Gorno-Tempini and Price,  ; Grabowski et al.,  ; Sugiura et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Damasio et al.,  ). \n\nRich and converging evidence for the role of the ATL in processing familiar faces also comes from the neuropsychology literature. Humans with ATL damage consistently exhibit problems with person memory, a disorder that Damasio and colleagues termed \u201camnesic associative prosopagnosia\u201d (Damasio et al.,  ). Patients with focal unilateral lesions of the ATL due to stroke, insult, or resection surgery have difficulties remembering information about people, especially their names [reviewed by Olson et al. ( ); Simmons and Martin ( ); Wong and Gallate ( )]. Damasio et al. ( ) carried out extensive research on the face processing capabilities of these individuals and reported that while face perception was intact, face memory was impaired. Left-lateralized lesions of the ATL tended to affect lexical aspects of person memory, such as recollection of names, while right-lateralized lesions tended to affect feelings of familiarity and processing and retrieval of biographical information. \n\nSimilarly, one of the first symptoms of semantic dementia, which is correlated with early deterioration of the ATLs, is difficulty remembering information about people such as their name and biographical information (Evans et al.,  ; Snowden et al.,  ). For instance, Thompson et al. ( ) reported that 31 of the 47 frontotemporal dementia patients in their study had specific complaints of difficulty recalling people's names. \n\nThe face sensitivity of the ATL is both mnemonic and perceptual. Electrophysiological and fMRI studies in humans and monkeys indicate that the ventral ATL is sensitive to novel faces (Nestor et al.,  ) and that activity in this region is enhanced by affective experience and conceptual familiarity with the depicted faces (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). As noted earlier, patients with ATL lesions have intact face perception, but impaired face memory (Damasio et al.,  ). Allison and colleagues recorded from the ventral surface of the human temporal lobe in patients undergoing resection surgery and found that a late event-related potential (ERP) termed the P350 localized to the ventral ATL was preferentially sensitive to faces and especially to face priming (Allison et al.,  ; Barbeau et al.,  ). Neurons in monkey ventral ATL have response profiles indicative of mnemonic activity: spike rate decreases rapidly with stimulus repetition, firing patterns are maintaining over brief delay intervals, and neurons appear to be sensitive to associations between faces and other stimuli (Nakamura et al.,  ; Nakamura and Kubota,  ). \n\nIn sum, these findings provide consistent evidence that subregions of the ATL play an important role in person identification and memory. The goal of the current study was to examine this general finding in greater detail so that we can more precisely describe the functional anatomy and response properties of the ATL. We were interested in two specific questions: (1) Are the same ATL subregions sensitive to personally familiar and famous faces? (2) Are the face-sensitive subregions of the ATL localized to dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL? \n\nWith respect to the first question, a small number of studies have reported greater BOLD activity to personally familiar as compared to famous faces in the ATL, as well as in the (MPFC), limbic regions, temporal parietal junction, and the posterior cingulate. These differences have been variously attributed to person-selective representations (Gobbini et al.,  ; Sugiura et al.,  ,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ) or to the socioemotional aspects of recognizing familiar people (Gobbini et al.,  ; Gobbini and Haxby,  ; Trinkler et al.,  ). In one recent study, repetition suppression to familiar faces was observed in a superior-medial region of the ATL (Sugiura et al.,  ). However, no activations to famous faces were found in the ATL. This finding is an outlier in the greater ATL literature since a large number of prior findings have reported that famous faces activate the ATL and that ATL damage impairs the ability to recognize or name famous faces. As such, more research is needed, using imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage. \n\nIn regards to the second question it is informative to review findings from macaques in order to better understand the particular ATL subregions sensitive to faces. Several high-resolution fMRI studies in macaques have reported the existence of face-sensitive patches in the ventral ATL (Hadj-Bouziane et al.,  ; Moeller et al.,  ; Tsao et al.,  ; Bell et al.,  ; Rajimehr et al.,  ; Ku et al.,  ; Pinsk et al.,  ). Earlier single-unit studies reported face sensitive neurons in the anterior STS and the temporal pole (Hasselmo et al.,  ; Eifuku et al.,  ; De Souza et al.,  ; Leopold et al.,  ). \n\nThe monkey ATL face patches are found on the inferior bank of the anterior STS going into the anterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the inferior surface of the ATL (Ku et al.,  ). No activations have been reported in the polar tip or superior aspects of the ATL. Two studies using unfamiliar face stimuli directly compared monkeys to humans and found homologous activated face patches in the anterior MTG and ventral surface of the ATL (Rajimehr et al.,  ; Pinsk et al.,  ). The majority of studies reporting ATL activations in humans have used famous or personally familiar face stimuli, although in two notable cases unfamiliar faces were shown to activate the ATL. Kriegeskorte et al. ( ) and Nestor et al. ( ) used multivariate techniques to ask which parts of the brain discriminate individual faces. The peak described by Kriegeskorte was in the right ventral ATL and the peak described by Nestor was in the right ventromedial ATL\/uncus. \n\nIn contrast, the reported ATL activations to famous and personally familiar faces in human studies are typically in the polar tip and the superior ATL. It is unclear whether this localization is real or an artifact of methodological difficulties of imaging the ATLs. fMRI signals in the ATLs are compromised by susceptibility artifacts and signal distortion due to the proximity of these regions to the nasal sinuses and ear canals (Devlin et al.,  ). Moreover, many studies use a restricted field-of-view (FOV) that excludes the inferior parts of the brain, including the inferior ATL, from image acquisition (Visser et al.,  ). \n\nIn order to answer our two questions of interest, we used two methods. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies of person memory using the activation likelihood method (ALE) (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Second, we conducted an fMRI study of person knowledge using imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage in which activations to personally familiar individuals and famous faces were qualitatively compared to each other. We predicted that personally familiar as compared to famous and unfamiliar faces would be associated with greater activations in the superior-polar ATL due to the greater emotional processing performed on these stimuli. Evidence suggests the superior-polar aspects of the ATL are more closely connected with neuromodulatory regions such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, and are more greatly involved in abstract forms of social and emotional processing (see Olson et al.,   for a review). In addition we predicted that when optimized imaging parameters were used, we would find evidence of face-sensitive ATL activations that extend into the ventral ATL. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \nA total of 25 articles were included in the ALE analysis. Seven of these studies were used in the personally familiar condition with a total of 136 subjects (70 male, 66 female; mean age = 28.9 years). The famous face condition was comprised of 18 studies and had 247 subjects (125 male, 122 female; mean age = 28.74 years). A total of 202 foci were used in the personally familiar face condition and 340 foci were used in the famous face condition. \n\n#### Procedure \n  \nOur methods follow those detailed by Binder et al. ( ) and are summarized below. All coordinates were reported in or converted to Talairach space. Random effects analysis [consistent with Eickhoff et al. ( )] were conducted and probabilistic maps of the resulting sets of coordinates were constructed using the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method (Turkeltaub et al.,  ), implemented in the GingerALE 2.1 software package (Laird et al.,  ) (available at www.brainmap.org), using an 8-mm FWHM 3D Gaussian point spread function and a spatial grid composed of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm voxels. This method treats each reported focus as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution. The 3D Gaussian distributions corresponding to all foci included in a given random effects analysis are summed to create a whole-brain map that represents the overlap of activation peaks at each voxel. The ALE statistical map is converted into a voxelwise probability map. ALE maps from each dataset were thresholded at an ALE value that yielded a corrected mapwise value and a false discovery rate (FDR) of   p   < 0.05. The maps depicted in the figures are the corrected ALE maps generated by GingerALE 2.1 software. \n\n\n#### Study inclusion criteria and description \n  \nStudies were identified through searches of online databases for the years 1980 through 2012 (see Table  ). Any additional relevant articles known to the authors, cited in the initial set of articles, or encountered during the review process were added to the list. Inclusion criteria were: (1) the use of fMRI; (2) testing of healthy young human participants; (3) use of a standard control or baseline task; (4) whole or nearly whole brain analysis; (5) availability of peak activation coordinates from a group activation map; and (6) use of several different famous or personally familiar faces as stimuli (studies that used a single face stimulus, such as a romantic partner, were excluded). Studies were also excluded if they used non-standard cohort sizes (  N   < 10) or imaging parameters (e.g., TE of 66) that diminished the possibility of observing activations in the ATLs. Our analysis used two person memory comparisons:\n   \nPersonally known faces (personal acquaintances, close friends, and familiar faces): Total papers = 7. Coordinates were included from the following contrasts: friends\/family > baseline; friends\/family > unfamiliar. \n  \nFamous faces: Total Papers = 18. Coordinates were included from the following contrasts: famous > baseline; famous > unfamiliar. \n  \n  \n fMRI studies of person knowledge included in the random effects ALE analysis  . \n  \nData from the \u201ctrained knowledge\u201d column includes studies in which study participants were trained to associate different types of semantic knowledge (e.g., a profession) with a novel face. These data were not included in an ALE analysis because the number of studies was small and the training paradigms variable. The last two columns list whether ATL activations were reported and the experimental task\/comparisons in each study. We note that Turk and colleagues ( ) reported that technical limitations kept them from seeing activations in the ATL. \n  \nWe created conjunction maps by overlaying these analyses. \n\n\n\n### Empirical study \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nSeventeen female adults were recruited from the greater Philadelphia area via local advertisements. Data from two participants were excluded due to excessive movement. The final sample consisted of 15 female participants (mean age = 22.33, SD = 3.51). We chose to restrict our sample to females because numerous behavioral and neural studies of face recognition have reported significant gender differences (Ellis et al.,  ; Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd,  ; Lewin and Herlitz,  ; Rehnan and Herlitz,  ,  ; McBain et al.,  ; Ino et al.,  ; Megreya et al.,  ). All participants received monetary compensation for their participation. They were native English speakers, right-handed, had normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of psychological, developmental, or neurological disorders. Informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the Temple University. \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nThere were four types of stimuli. The   famous face stimuli   (=Faces ) consisted of 32 people that had a high likelihood of being known by the average American undergraduate or graduate student (e.g., Brad Pitt). The   friend face stimuli   (=Faces ) were individually tailored for each participant. Each participant brought two different photos of the faces of 5 best friends, 5 close friends, and 5 acquaintances to a pre-testing session. Photos consisted of snapshots that varied in lighting, poses, facial expressions, quality, etc. The   unfamiliar face stimuli   (=Faces ) were a wide selection of unknown faces whose ethnicities and ages matched that of the famous faces and the friends. Like the other face stimuli, they consisted of a mixture of professional photographs and snapshots that varied in lighting, pose, etc. Last, the   baseline control stimuli   consisted of blurred images. Additional comparison and baseline conditions consisted of famous landmarks (=Landm ), non-famous landmarks (=Landm ), and a blurred landmark baseline. Similar stimuli were used as a fame localizer in a previous study by our laboratory (Ross and Olson,  ). \n\n\n#### fMRI task and design \n  \nAll participants were provided with standardized computer-based instructions and a practice session prior to the scan. During the scan, a ~10 min long high-resolution anatomical scan was collected prior to the experiment. Portions on the fMRI task are irrelevant to the question asked in this study and will be described in a different publication. \n\n  Famous face task.    Our laboratory used a face memory localizer task that had been used successfully in a previous study to localize activation for famous faces (Ross and Olson,  ). During the localizer run, a 0-back task was used in which participants were told to press a button with their left index finger when two stimuli of the same type were detected in succession: both famous, both non-famous, or both baseline images in succession. Participants were also told to press with the right index finger when it was a mixed condition (e.g., one famous and one non-famous face). During one block two stimuli were presented in succession, for the duration of 4.5 s each. Each blocked presentation was preceded by a 3 s prompt with a brief reminder of the instruction and followed by a 3 s response prompt. Blocks consisted of pairs of pictures that were both famous (20), both non-famous (20), mixed (10), face baseline (5), landmark baseline (5) totaling 60 blocks, and a duration of 15 min. \n\n  Friend face task.    There were five experimental runs during which participants performed a social and geographical closeness task using photos of friends and unknown individuals. The experimental task had a 2 (type of closeness: social, geographical) \u00d7 2 (stimulus: faces, names) \u00d7 3 (distance: close, medium, far) design. Baseline conditions were also included in each run and consisted of the faces and names of unknown people. Only brain activations in response to the faces of friends and unknown people in the social closeness and baseline conditions are relevant to the question of interest in this study and are described in greater detail. Photographs of the faces of \u201cbest friends,\u201d \u201cclose friends,\u201d \u201cacquaintances,\u201d and \u201cunknown people\u201d were presented in separate blocks during a single run. \n\nOn each trial one photo was presented left of center and the second photo was presented right of center. One photo in each pair was always presented at a discriminable location above the center x axis of the screen and the other photo was presented at a counter location below the x axis. During the social closeness condition, participants indicated by button press whether the friend shown on the left or on the right of the screen was socially closest to them. During baseline blocks, participants were asked to decide which photograph of an unknown person was presented in a higher position on the screen by pressing the left or right button with their index finger. Each run was comprised of 14 blocks that were 18 s long. A 3 s instruction screen was followed by 5 trials consisting of a 2.5 s presentation of two friends photographs and a 0.5 s inter-trial interval. A 9 s rest period during which a fixation cross was presented followed each block. Each condition was presented one time in a single run. \n\n\n#### Imaging procedure \n  \nNeuroimaging sessions were conducted at the Temple University Hospital on a 3.0 T Siemens Verio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel Siemens head coil. \n\nFunctional T2 -weighted images sensitive to blood oxygenation level-dependent contrasts were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence [repetition time (TR), 3 s; echo time (TE), 20 ms;   FOV   = 240 \u00d7 240; voxel size, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2.5 mm; matrix size, 80 \u00d7 80; flip angle = 90\u00b0] and automatic shimming. This pulse sequence was optimized for ATL coverage and sensitivity based on pilot scans performed for this purpose, details of which are reported in Ross and Olson ( ). Visual inspection of the coregistered functional image confirmed excellent signal coverage in the ATLs in all participants. Some signal loss in the orbitofrontal cortex was observed and varied between participants (see Figure  ). \n  \n Probability maps (PM) reporting the percentage or participants (ranging from 10 to 100%) that showed a TSNR greater than 40 for each voxel.   Panel   (A)   provides a view of the coverage for all participants in the orbitofrontal cortex. Panel   (B)   provides a view of the coverage in the left anterior temporal lobe. \n  \nThirty-eight interleaved axial slices with 2.5 mm thickness were acquired to cover the temporal lobes. On the basis of the anatomical information of the structural scan the lowest slice was individually fitted to cover the most inferior aspect of the inferior temporal lobes. \n\nThe functional runs were preceded by a high-resolution anatomical scan that was ~10 min long. The anatomical image was used to fit the volume of covered brain tissue acquired in the functional scan. The T1-weighted images were acquired using a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo pulse sequence (TR, 1900 ms; TE, 2.94 ms; FOV = 188 \u00d7 250 mm; inversion time, 900 ms; voxel size, 1 \u00d7 0.9766 \u00d7 0.9766 mm; matrix size, 188 \u00d7 256; flip angle = 9\u00b0, 144 contiguous slices of 0.9766 mm thickness). Visual stimuli were shown through goggles with a resolution of 800 \u00d7 600 pixels, purchased from Resonance Technologies, CA, USA. Responses were recorded using a four-button fiber optic response pad system. The stimulus delivery was controlled by E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburg, PA) on a windows laptop located in the scanner control room. \n\n\n#### Image analysis \n  \nfMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using Brain Voyager software (Goebel et al.,  ). The preprocessing of the functional data included a correction for head motion (trilinear\/sinc interpolation), the removal of linear trends and frequency temporal filtering using a fast fourier transform (FFT) and a cut-off of three cycles or sine waves. The data were coregistered with their respective anatomical data and transformed into Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). The resulting volumetric time course data were smoothed using an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. \n\nFor all blocks, a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) was modeled spanning the 15 s for each block. A z-transform was applied to normalize the time course. Predictors were built by convolving the boxcar waveform for each condition with a double-gamma HRF (onset = 0, response undershoot ratio = 6, time to response peak = 5 s, time to undershoot peak = 15 s, response dispersion = 1, undershoot dispersion = 1). Only the manipulated conditions in the 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 design were included in the model. Motion parameters were not included as covariates in the regression, because motion was corrected for in preprocessing. Including them as covariates in the regression has been shown to have a deleterious effect on the mean contrast estimates in block design studies (Johnstone et al.,  ). The 3 s instruction screen at the start of each block and the 9 s rest period following each block were modeled out and were also not included in the HRF. \n\n\n#### Temporal signal to noise ratio (TSNR) \n  \nThe ATL and inferior portions of the frontal lobe are prone to susceptibility artifacts so we examined [Temporal Signal to Noise Ratio (TSNR)] maps to ensure that the quality of the signal in these regions was adequate to detect BOLD signal. To check the consistency of coverage in the signal quality in the ATLs, we generated probability maps indicating for each voxel the percentage of participants that showed TSNR above the threshold of 40, which is considered sufficient for detecting differences between conditions (Murphy et al.,  ). Using a highly conservative estimate of signal coverage in the bilateral ATL, 7 participants showed full coverage and 8 participants showed some signal loss either on the inferior surface (a small portion of the inferior ATL), medial surface near piriform cortex, or a region just posterior to the ATLs caused by the ear canals. Six participants showed full coverage of the orbitofrontal cortex and 9 participants showed minor loss in coverage of the most inferior slice in the posterior orbitofrontal cortex. Overall, the signal quality in the ATL was excellent. Figure   shows a probability map that the TSNR was above 40 for each voxel for all participants. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nWe performed a whole-brain analysis using a random effects general linear model for conditions in each of the experimental tasks. We used a voxelwise FDR approach to try and replicate previous findings in humans for famous\/non-famous faces and landmarks. We also used this approach to assess activations in the ATL for novel faces\/novel landmarks that were comparable to those activations reported in monkey studies. Second, we conducted somewhat more liberal whole-brain analyses using a cluster thresholding procedure that calculates the likelihood of obtaining different cluster sizes over 1000 trials. This procedure began by setting the voxelwise threshold to   p   < 0.05 and was followed by the Monte Carlo simulation of this data to produce a cluster threshold that also ensures a global error rate of   p   < 0.05. Each cluster size threshold was calculated within a whole-brain gray matter map. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE results \n  \nThe results of the ALE random effects analyses are reported in Table   and depicted in Figure  , top panel. All ALE results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method at a threshold of   p   < 0.05 and a minimum cluster size of 100 mm . Both conditions showed a left-lateralized bias although some significant activations were also found in the right hemisphere. Of interest to the topic of this paper, there were three left-lateralized ATL loci's: (1) a ventromedial activation, corresponding to entorhinal cortex to famous faces; (2) an anterior STS activation to personally familiar faces; and (3) a temporal pole [anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG)] activation to both famous and personally familiar faces. The entorhinal activation was part of a larger activation extending along the entire length of the hippocampus, spilling over into the amygdala. In contrast, the anterior STS activation was very focal. Last, the striking temporal polar activation continued into orbitofrontal cortex in more dorsal slices. Famous faces showed a relatively more ventral pattern of activation with the most ventral activation in the medial ATL\/entorhinal cortex at \u221226, \u22126, \u221229. \n  \n Talairach coordinates of peak activations from the random effects ALE meta-analysis  . \n    \n Activations to famous and familiar faces from a random effects ALE meta-analysis (Panel A) and activations from random effects group analyses in the empirical study (Panel B).   The white circles highlight activations to famous and familiar faces in the left anterior temporal lobe. \n  \n\n### Empirical study results \n  \n#### Behavioral findings \n  \nDuring the famous face task, participants correctly identified 94% of the famous faces, 70% of the non-famous faces, 86% of the famous landmarks, and 67% of non-famous landmarks. Mixed face trials (distractors) were identified with 78% accuracy and mixed place trials in 71% of cases. The baseline task was correctly performed in 92% of all cases. \n\nThe social closeness judgments participants made of their best friends during the five main experimental runs were 91% consistent with their previously reported rank orderings. Response consistency was judged by comparing the behavioral data during the scanner task to the rank orderings of best friends on social closeness that participants made during the preliminary testing session. Participants were 98% accurate performing the baseline task with photos of unknown people. \n\n\n#### Functional MRI results \n  \nFirst we performed a \u201csanity check\u201d that was aimed at replicating prior findings about non-famous faces\/landmarks. We asked whether faces and landmarks   per se   activated well-known networks of brain regions including the fusiform face area. We performed a whole brain analysis of the conditions in the famous face task using a random effects general linear model. We then conducted a contrast between all faces and landmarks [(Faces  + Faces  + Faces ) vs. (Landm  + Landm  + Landm )] at an FDR corrected threshold [q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.006] for the whole brain. The   t  -map revealed that faces relative to landmarks-activated regions previously shown to be engaged in face processing: right FFA, bilateral temporoparietal junction going into the posterior STS, precuneus, bilateral ATL in the anteriormost section of the MTG, bilateral entorhinal cortex, and a small region of MPFC. Likewise, landmarks engaged a typical pattern of activity in bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, and regions of the dorsal visual stream. At this threshold, landmarks did not activate the ATL. \n\nSecond, we asked whether novel faces, as used in many monkey fMRI studies, activate the ATL. We compared novel faces to novel landmarks [Faces  vs. Landmarks ; q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.005] and found a small region of activation in the right FFA and the right ventromedial ATL in a region corresponding to perirhinal cortex (see Figure  , top panel). This ATL activation is posterior to the ATL activations to famous and familiar faces, reported later. Landmarks engaged a typical pattern of activity in bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, regions of the dorsal visual stream, and did not activate the ATL. \n  \n Activations to a comparison of novel faces and novel landmarks from the empirical study are also shown (Panel A).   The white circle highlights activation to novel faces in the right ATL. Activations to a comparison of famous faces and novel landmarks from the empirical study are also shown (Panel   B  ). The white circle highlights activation to famous faces in the left and right ATL. \n  \nThird, using the same baseline task as the prior analysis, we asked whether famous and personally familiar faces activated the ATL. We compared famous faces to novel landmarks [Faces  vs. Landmarks ; q  < 0.05;   p   < 0.005] and found regions typically engaged in face processing including the right FFA, precuneus, MTG, and bilateral ventromedial ATL activations. Although the centroid of the ATL activity was similar to that found for novel faces, the activations were bilateral and more extensive (see Figure  ). Again, landmarks demonstrated a typical pattern of activity activating the bilateral PPA, retrosplenial cortex, regions of the dorsal visual stream, and did not activate the ATL. \n\nFourth, to specifically examine face familiarity, we asked whether famous faces preferentially activated the ATL using the contrast (Faces  vs. Faces ). We present these results corrected for multiple comparisons at   p   < 0.05 with a cluster threshold applied (cluster threshold = 45). This contrast revealed two face patches in the left ATL: (1) a patch in the polar aspect of the MTG; (2) a smaller medial activation in entorhinal cortex. One right-lateralized ATL activation, in the ventral ATL corresponding to parahippocampal gyrus\/entorhinal cortex, was found when we used a more liberal threshold of   p   < 0.05 (uncorrected). Other activations specific to famous faces were in the posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, left FFA, and right supermarginal gyrus. Non-famous faces compared to famous faces preferentially activated clusters in the parietal and frontal lobes (see Table  ). \n  \n Talairach coordinates of peak activations from the empirical study  . \n  \nTo see whether the ATL activations were specific to famous face stimuli as compared to other unique stimuli such as famous landmarks, we performed the same contrast corrected for multiple comparisons but on landmark stimuli (Landmarks  vs. Landmarks ;   p   < 0.05 cluster threshold = 39). Bilateral ATL activations were observed in a ventral medial portion of the ATL, more posterior and ventral in the uncus\/perirhinal cortex (\u221222, \u22121, \u221239) to that observed in the famous face contrast. A similar locus of activity was reported previously (Ross and Olson,  ). Activations to famous landmarks did not overlap with the activations to famous faces in the ATLs. \n\nLast, we asked whether personally familiar individuals (e.g., best friends) activated the ATL in a similar manner as famous faces. We performed a whole brain analysis of conditions in the friend face task using a random effects general linear model. We then conducted a contrast corrected for multiple comparisons: Faces  vs. Faces ;   p   < 0.05; cluster threshold = 51. This contrast showed two left-lateralized ATL patches: (1) a patch in the anterior STS; and (2) a patch in the anterior MTG\/pole. Additional left lateralized activations were observed in orbitofrontal cortex, medial PFC, ACC, hippocampus, precuneus, extrastriate visual cortex, as well as bilateral activations in the FFA, TPJ, and other regions (see Table  ). No regions were relatively more sensitive to novel faces. \n\nThe conjunction map revealed minor overlap for famous and familiar in the left ATL polar tip (see Figure  , bottom panel). \n\nVisual comparison between the activations found in the meta-analysis and our empirical study revealed strikingly similar activations (see Figure  ). Both the ALE and empirical analyses showed left-lateralized activations to famous and personally familiar faces in the ATL. Within the left ATL, both analyses showed that famous faces active a ventromedial region corresponding to entorhinal cortex. Also both analyses showed that famous and personally familiar faces activate an overlapping region of the temporal pole (BA 38). In the ALE analysis, this extended into orbitofrontal cortex for both comparisons while in the empirical analysis it was only observed for the personally familiar contrast. One difference revealed by this comparison is that activations to famous faces were relatively more ventral in the empirical analysis (z plane = \u221234) as compared to the ALE analysis (z plane = \u221229). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe goal of the present study was to investigate two questions in order to learn more about the sensitivity of the ATL to faces: (1) Are the same ATL subregions sensitive to personally familiar, famous, and novel faces? (2) Are the face-sensitive subregions of the ATL localized to dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL? To answer these questions we qualitatively compared the results of our ALE meta-analysis of face familiarity to the findings from our empirical fMRI study using famous, personally familiar, and unfamiliar faces. We were particularly interested in whether ATL activations to different categories of faces were present in the ventral ATL, similar to what has been reported in monkeys using novel and familiar faces. In order to maximize our ability to find activations in the ATL in our empirical study, we used imaging parameters optimized for ATL coverage. Overall, the findings of the empirical study and meta-analysis were notably consistent revealing left-lateralized ATL sensitivity to two kinds of familiar faces and right-lateralized sensitivity to novel faces. In addition, the activations to familiar faces associated with knowledge were found in distinct subregions of the left ATL with the only overlap occurring in the polar tip. \n\n### Activation of the anterior temporal lobes by novel, famous, and personally familiar faces \n  \nWe began by conducting a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies of person memory where the typical subtraction is famous or personally familiar faces minus unfamiliar faces. Although the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria we used in our ALE analyses resulted in a number of studies included in the final analysis that might be considered small [see Turkeltaub and Coslett ( ) for a discussion of group size], we used a conservative random effects ALE meta-analysis that allowed generalization of the results to the entire population of analyzed studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The results showed significant left-lateralized ATL activations for personally familiar and famous faces. Personally familiar faces activated distinct regions of the left superior ATL and the left orbitofrontal cortex. Regions activated by personally familiar faces showed some overlap with regions of the left temporal pole that were activated by famous faces. Famous face activations extended more ventrally, although not to the ventral surface. Other regions of overlapping activations are reported in Table  . \n\nAlthough we found robust activations to famous and personally familiar faces in the ALE analysis, the activations did not extend into the ventral ATL in and around the anterior MTG, as is commonly reported in monkey fMRI studies. There are several inter-related cognitive explanations for this difference: familiar faces may activate more superior\/polar regions of the ATL compared to non-familiar faces (which are most commonly used in monkey studies), due to their emotional, semantic, or verbal content. Alternatively, the subtraction used in the studies that make up the ALE analysis is famous\/familiar faces minus unfamiliar faces which essentially leaves behind non-visual information such as proper names, biographical information including unique information for the famous individuals, episodic information (e.g., experiences with that person), and affective information, especially for the personally familiar faces. Thus, the observed ATL activations represent some combination of these non-visual factors. For example, the fact that the ATL activations to familiar vs. unfamiliar faces were left-lateralized might imply that verbal factors such as the retrieval of proper names made an important contribution (Fukatsu et al.,  ; Tsukiura et al.,  ; Glosser et al.,  ). \n\nA second more technical explanation is that neurons that are sensitive to familiar faces exist in the ventral ATL, but were not revealed by our meta-analysis due to signal drop out and distortion. Signal drop-out and distortion in the inferior surface and polar tip of the ATL are common and especially problematic when studies use a high TE and large voxel size. We selected studies for our ALE meta-analysis using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to optimize our ability to reveal activations in the ventral ATL if present. However, we can not rule out the possibility that a majority of the studies included in our meta-analyses were still subject to these technical issues. \n\nIn order to address this interpretive problem and provide converging evidence for our results, we conducted an fMRI study of person knowledge using an imaging protocol that was optimized for coverage in the ATL. We examined activations to novel faces, famous faces, and personally familiar faces. Collapsing across all face conditions, faces contrasted to landmarks activated a network that included bilateral ATLs. When the conditions were split apart, it was found that a small region of the right ventromedial ATL was sensitive to novel faces, while bilateral ventromedial ATL activations were observed to famous faces as compared to the baseline task. To examine the specific contribution of familiarity, we contrasted familiar faces with unfamiliar faces. Personally familiar faces were associated with left lateralized activations in the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula, and the temporal pole. The polar activation began in the anterior STS and extended into superior aspects of BA 38. Famous faces activated a more restricted set of voxels in the temporal pole that overlapped with the activations to personally familiar faces but extended more ventrally. \n\nOverall, the findings of the empirical study and meta-analysis were remarkably similar. Both studies showed a left-lateralized ATL sensitivity to two kinds of familiar faces. In addition, the only consistent overlap in activations in both studies to faces associated with knowledge was in the polar tip of the ATL. Optimized imaging parameters in our empirical study allowed us to see face-sensitive ATL activations in the ventral ATL, similar to what has been reported in studies of non-human primates. \n\n\n### Functional subdivisions and anatomical localization \n  \nSeveral authors have suggested that the ATL has discrete functional subregions (Moran et al.,  ; Ding et al.,  ; Martin,  ) and one such subregion may be a face selective region in the ventral ATL. fMRI studies in non-human primates have identified somewhat variable activation loci for faces, varying from the inferior bank of the STS on the lateral surface to the inferior surface of the ATL (Ku et al.,  ). In humans, two MVPA studies of facial identity using novel faces have also reported somewhat different loci in the right ventral ATL: one study reported an extremely medial peak in the uncus, possibly corresponding to perirhinal cortex (Nestor et al.,  ) while another study reported a peak in the anterior MTG (BA 21) (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). Our activations to novel faces are remarkably similar to that reported by Nestor and colleagues. The most ventral ATL peak to unfamiliar faces in our study was at 29, \u22125, \u221231. The most ventral peaks to familiar minus novel faces in our empirical study were left-lateralized and in a similar depth plane to that reported by Kriegeskorte, but slightly more anterior in BA 38 (famous vs. novel faces: \u221232, 14, \u221236; best friends vs. novel faces: \u221247, 11, \u221231). The most ventral peaks found in the empirical study were to famous faces minus novel landmarks on the surface of the ATL at left (\u221236, 6, \u221242) and right (35, 3, \u221242) locations. \n\nWe did not have any a priori hypotheses about lateralization. It is plausible that the left-lateralized activations to familiar faces in both the meta-analysis and empirical study reflect lexical features of these stimuli that are not present in unfamiliar faces. We note that this is consistent with the neuropsychology literature reviewed earlier (Gainotti,  ). \n\n\n### The specific role of the anterior temporal lobe in person memory \n  \nThere is widespread agreement that portions of the ATL play a mnemonic role in face processing, especially in face identification. It has been suggested that the ventral ATL face patch uses a population code to represent subtle differences between individual faces (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). The exact facial dimension that the ATL uses to do this is not known. What we do know is that cells in the macaque ventral ATL respond to changes in facial identity but not to perceptual changes that leave identity intact, such as rotation (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). Similarly, the BOLD signal in ventral ATL, including perirhinal cortex, is sensitive to changes to facial identity but not other types of perceptual changes such as color (Graham et al.,  ). \n\nThese same ventral ATL regions are up-regulated in the presence of conceptual information about faces such as personal familiarity, semantic uniqueness, or names (Barense et al.,  ; Eifuku et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ). Conceptual knowledge provides a powerful tool for abstracting over perceptual differences between items from the same class and highlighting differences between items from different classes. Conceptual knowledge, especially in the form of verbal labels, is a useful information-compression mechanism that allows us to carve up the perceptual world into the categories that are relevant to our behavior (Goldstone and Styvers,  ). Interestingly, researchers in the aphasia and semantic memory literature have proposed that portions of the ATL have an important role in storing and retrieving concrete concepts although there is disagreement about the precise nature of this role and the ATL subregion involved in this process (Patterson et al.,  ; Simmons and Martin,  ; Binder and Desai,  ). Our laboratory and others have reported that the superior bank of the anterior STS\/superior-polar tip is preferentially sensitive to social concepts such as social words (e.g., \u201cfriendly\u201d) and vignettes that evoke theory of mind (Zahn et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ). The superior loci for these effects may reflect the connectivity of superior-polar regions of the ATL to neuromodulatory regions, the amygdala, and hypothalamus [see Olson et al. ( ) for a review]. Indeed one recent study proposed that the dorsal ATL is part of an \u201caffective\u201d system while the ventral ATL is part of a social perception system (Bickart et al.,  ). Bringing these literatures together, it seems plausible that the ventral ATL codes for facial identity by linking-specific faces to social semantic knowledge stored in more superior ATL regions. \n\nCells in the ventral ATL can associate specific faces to identifying information such as affective feelings, names, and biographical information by virtue of their association formation capabilities. In the early 90's it was reported that single neurons in the ventral ATL of monkeys that initially responded to only one abstract pattern, would later respond to a second abstract pattern that had been associated via training with the first (Sakai and Miyashita,  ). More recently it was shown that cells in the ventral ATL in monkeys can represent an trained associative pairing between faces and abstract patterns (Eifuku et al.,  ). Likewise, in humans it has been reported that successful encoding of person-related semantics with a proper name was associated with left ATL BOLD activity (Tsukiura et al.,  ). Even more compelling are findings showing that patients with left ATL lesions are unable to form new associations between names and pictures of objects (Sharon et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough our discussion thus far has emphasized face memory, it should be noted that face patches in the ATL are sensitive to novel faces (Tsao et al.,  ). Our findings also show this. Based on the sensitivity of this region to novel faces, it has also been argued that the ATL is part of a network for perceptual face discrimination (Nestor et al.,  ). We agree with this sentiment however we argue that this is the proverbial \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d since the properties of cells in this region appear to bridge perception and memory. Indeed, both components are required for accurate and rapid identification and there is a wealth of behavioral data showing that person identification is speeded by knowledge (e.g., Young et al.,  ,  ; Bruce and Valentine,  ). As noted earlier, cells in ventral ATL are only sensitive to certain perceptual manipulations such as changes in facial identity, but not to perceptual changes that leave identity intact (Eifuku et al.,  ,  ). However, ventral ATL cells are acutely sensitive to different types of familiarity manipulations: responsiveness is enhanced by knowledge-base familiarity in the form of semantic knowledge (Nieuwenhuis et al.,  ; Ross and Olson,  ) but decreased by perceptual familiarity in the form of stimulus repetition (Sugiura et al.,  ,  ). The strong repetition suppression effect may underlie the familiarity signal reportedly lost after ATL damage (Bowles et al.,  ; Gainotti,  ). \n\nAlthough the response properties of cells in the ventral ATL might seem discordant, they in fact mirror important features of everyday experience with other individuals. On the one hand, when an individual is important to us we acquire knowledge about their name, interests, personality characteristics, and our emotional reactivity to them becomes more nuanced. On the other hand, there are individuals who we frequently see but we stop noticing, such as commuters on the 9 a.m. train, because they have no personal significance. Such   perceptual familiarity   is somewhat trivial when compared to the power exerted by knowledge on face identification. We propose that ATL face patches are active at both encoding and retrieval to integrate perceptual and mnemonic information to form a salience-tagged representation of different individuals. \n\n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3561664,"text_md5":"45e7a90483e908c7269a15daf0809528","field_positions":{"authors":[0,68],"journal":[69,87],"publication_year":[89,93],"title":[104,171],"keywords":[185,306],"abstract":[319,1651],"body":[1660,48620]},"batch":1,"pmid":23378834,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2013.00017","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3561664","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3561664"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3561664\">3561664<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3561664  Anterior temporal face patches: a meta-analysis and empirical study"}

However, neural activity peaks labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d in human neuroimaging studies investigating spatial orientation often lie significantly outside of the retrosplenial cortex proper. This has led to a large and anatomically heterogenous region being ascribed numerous roles in spatial orientation and navigation. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) investigations of spatial orientation and navigation and have identified a ventral-dorsal functional specialization within the posterior cingulate for   spatial encoding   vs.   spatial recall  . Generally, ventral portions of the posterior cingulate cortex were more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , i.e., passive viewing of scenes or active navigation without a demand to respond, perform a spatial computation, or localize oneself in the environment. Conversely, dorsal portions of the posterior cingulate cortex were more likely to be activated by cognitive demands to recall spatial information or to produce judgments of distance or direction to non-visible locations or landmarks. The greatly varying resting-state functional connectivity profiles of the ventral (centroids at MNI \u221222, \u221260, 6 and 20, \u221256, 6) and dorsal (centroid at MNI 4, \u221260, 28) posterior cingulate regions identified in the meta-analysis supported the conclusion that these regions, which would commonly be labeled as \u201cretrosplenial cortex,\u201d should be more appropriately referred to as distinct subregions of the posterior cingulate cortex. We suggest that future studies investigating the role of the retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortex in spatial tasks carefully localize activity in the context of these identifiable subregions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver a century ago, Korbinian Brodmann published an exhaustive cytological parcellation of the human cerebral cortex (Brodmann,  ); as a testament to his work, this parcellation is still commonly used across all neurological disciplines. Of particular interest in Brodmann\u2019s parcellation is the retrosplenial cortex (Brodmann\u2019s areas 26, 29, and 30), a small, enigmatic region in the human brain that Brodmann was only able to identify after delineating this region in lower animals, in which it is relatively larger and more easily identifiable (Brodmann,  , 124). In humans, the retrosplenial cortex occupies the small portion of the cingulate cortex that is immediately posterior to the most posterior region of the corpus callosum (i.e., the splenium). While at the time Brodmann was unsure of the significance of the retrosplenial cortex (and neighboring posterior cingulate areas 23 and 31; Brodmann,  , 123), more recently, this tiny region has been ascribed important functions involving emotion processing (Maddock,  ) and episodic memory (Spreng et al.,  ), with substantial literature reporting its critical role in spatial orientation and navigation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito,  ; Maguire,  ; Vann et al.,  ; Epstein et al.,  ). \n\nDespite a precise localization of the retrosplenial cortex in the human brain, the vast majority of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the role of this region in spatial cognition do not report results in the retrosplenial cortex proper. This is partially due to the fact that the retrosplenial cortex, as delineated by Vogt et al. ( ; Figure  ) is effectively too small to be studied with common fMRI voxel sizes (e.g., 3 mm isotropic) used for whole-brain imaging, resulting in many fMRI peaks labeled as \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d lying in the posterior cingulate cortex (Vogt et al.,  ). Therefore, while the anatomically-defined region retrosplenial cortex is quite small, the manner in which the label \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d is used spans a very large region of the posterior medial cortex with variable cytology (Maguire,  ; Vogt et al.,  ,  ) and functional connectivity (Bzdok et al.,  ). This includes the functionally-defined, scene-sensitive \u201cretrosplenial complex\u201d (Epstein,  ). \n  \nBrodmann\u2019s original depiction of the retrosplenial cortex   (A)  , which was intentionally overrepresented (Brodmann,  ). More modern illustrations based off the work by Morris et al. ( ) and Vogt et al. ( ) in panels   (B,C)  , respectively, depict a substantially humbler region. Brodmann\u2019s figures, originally published in 1910, are in the public domain. \n  \nAlthough the mislocalization of the retrosplenial cortex is somewhat egregious, it is not without precedence. Brodmann himself, in fact, intentionally overrepresented the size of the retrosplenial cortex in his original figures (Figure  ), and he noted this inaccuracy 16 pages after the figures (as it appears in the English translation by Gary). This large representation of the retrosplenial cortex also appeared in the Talairach atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), with the posterior border of the retrosplenial cortex reaching as far as the junction of the parietal-occipital fissure and the calcarine sulcus. This is in stark contrast to more modern cytological studies, which frequently confirm Brodmann\u2019s original localization (but not depiction) of the retrosplenial cortex as largely contained within the callosal sulcus and without the generous representation on the gyral surface (Figure  ; Morris et al.,  ; Vogt et al.,  ; Fatterpekar et al.,  ). \n\nWhile it is possible that a slight misrepresentation of an anatomically-defined region provides a more accurate representation of a functionally-defined region involved in spatial orientation and navigation, the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label has been used in human spatial cognition research far too liberally, including many areas of the posterior medial cortex far beyond the anatomical border of the retrosplenial cortex proper (Nasr et al.,  ; Marchette et al.,  ; Silson et al.,  ). Considering the wide variety of spatial orientation and navigation tasks producing activity in this large area of the human brain, it is likely it could be more accurately described as a collection of relatively distinct subregions, performing slightly different functions within the spatial cognition domain. Consistent with this assumption, we have recently identified a differential engagement of the ventral and dorsal portions of the posterior cingulate cortex while individuals performed a spatial memory task (Burles et al.,  ); we had identified that ventral regions were more involved in updating a mental representation of the environment, and more dorsal regions were involved in recalling the positions of unseen objects from that mental representation. These findings provided initial evidence of a simple encoding-recall specialization along the ventral-dorsal axis of the posterior cingulate and \u201cretrosplenial cortex.\u201d Here, we performed a meta-analysis of relevant fMRI studies to provide further evidence of a ventral-dorsal functional specialization of the posterior cingulate and neighboring cortex supporting the processes of encoding and recalling spatial information. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nTo identify relevant neuroimaging studies, we performed a literature search in PubMed identifying fMRI studies with human subjects investigating spatial orientation and mentioning retrosplenial or nearby regions in the posterior medial cortex. We ran the following conjunctive search: \n  \nretrosplenial OR (posterior cingulate) OR precuneus OR (medial parietal cortex) OR (posterior parietal cortex) OR ((parieto-occipital OR parietooccipital) and (sulcus OR fissure)) OR ((Brodmann Area OR BA) and (23 OR 26 OR 29 OR 30 OR 31)) \n\nAND \n  \n((spatial OR topographical OR place OR path OR scene) and (navigation OR memory OR recognition OR learning OR integration OR construction OR imagination OR orientation)) OR path integration OR dead reckoning OR cognitive map OR mental representation OR spatial configuration OR perspective taking \n\nAND \n  \nfMRI OR functional magnetic resonance imaging OR functional neuroimaging OR BOLD OR blood oxygen level dependent \n  \nThis conjunctive search produced 297 articles, which were subsequently filtered to only include the 61 research articles with healthy, adult subjects performing a spatial task while fMRI data were collected, with coordinates reported in the manuscript or supplementary materials. The references in five relevant review articles included in search results were mined, resulting in an additional 23 articles meeting these criteria included from 497 references. Finally, an additional seven articles known to the authors through personal communications with other researchers were included. The total sample of articles passing filtering was comprised of 91 articles. This search strategy was not intended to be exhaustive, but rather generate a sample that is adequately representative of the state of the cognitive neuroscience literature investigating human spatial orientation and navigation. \n\nFor each of these 91 articles, we attempted to classify BOLD contrasts as either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall  . Contrasts classified as   spatial encoding   were principally characterized by relatively more bottom-up or stimulus-driven BOLD activity. These included cases where participants were viewing or imagining visual stimuli, such as landmarks or scenes, or performing active navigation in a novel environment, without an explicit demand to perform a spatial computation or localize unseen landmarks in the environment. For instance, a functional localizer, contrasting BOLD activity while participants viewed scenes over BOLD activity while participants viewed faces or objects (Johnson et al.,  ; Sung et al.,  ) was classified as   spatial encoding  . These contrasts are commonly used to identify scene-sensitive retrosplenial and\/or parahippocampal cortex and represent an easily classifiable contrast as the detected BOLD activity relates specifically to encoding scenes and has no demand to recall any spatial or navigational information. This category also included contrasts such as the one performed by Aguirre et al. ( ), subtracting BOLD activity while participants followed an endless, looping corridor from the activity evoked while participants were freely exploring a maze, and presumably encoding the locations of landmarks for a future navigation task. \n\nConversely, the BOLD contrasts identified as   spatial recall   were generally complementary to the   spatial encoding   category, in a manner similar to a classic encoding\u2014recall dichotomy. For example, in the aforementioned study by Aguirre et al. ( ), free exploration in a maze over a control condition was classified as   spatial encoding  ; a complementary contrast of a spatial navigation task (i.e., participants locating a target landmark using the shortest route possible) over a control task, would be classified as   spatial recall  . However, this category also included contrasts weighted more heavily towards spatial representations or judgments in addition to recall   per se  . For instance, Rosenbaum et al. ( ) asked participants to perform proximity judgments between familiar landmarks in downtown Toronto. In this study, landmarks were presented to participants via text, resulting in participants relying strongly on their capacity to recall complex, well-learned, spatial information, and use it to perform a spatial computation, i.e., the proximity judgment. \n\nFrom the 91 articles passed on to classification, we classified 38 contrasts as   spatial encoding  , and 76 contrasts as   spatial recall   (Supplementary Table S1). We did not classify multiple non-orthogonal contrasts from a single study, and instead selected the contrast most representative of either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall  , leaving non-orthogonal contrasts unclassified. We then passed all coordinates from classified contrasts to a Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA; Wager et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) \n  \nWe first converted all peak coordinates reported in Talairach space to MNI space (Lancaster et al.,  ), and imported them into NeuroElf  to perform an MKDA. The coordinates were then smoothed using a 12-mm Gaussian kernel and combined to form a single map for each classified contrast, ensuring that contrasts reporting more coordinates (from utilizing more liberal statistical thresholds, for instance) were not overrepresented. These maps were weighted by the square root of the sample size reported in the study. We then compared the z-transformed proportion of voxels differentially and commonly involved in   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall  . To detect differential engagement, we compared the contrast of   spatial encoding vs. spatial recall   against an empirical null distribution generated from label permutation. To detect common engagement, we performed a conjunction from independent activations of   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   each compared against a spatial scrambling null distribution. In all cases 5000 simulation iterations were performed within an 8385 voxel retrosplenial and posterior cingulate mask, with a 2 mm resolution. The resulting statistical map was thresholded at   p   < 0.001. \n\n\n### Subregion Functional Connectivity Characterization \n  \nTo characterize the differences between subregions identified in the MKDA, we contrasted the resting-state functional connectivity profile of regions more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding   contrasts vs.   spatial recall   contrasts and vice-versa. We utilized preprocessed resting state functional connectivity data from 38 unrelated, young adult participants of the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al.,  ; Glasser et al.,  ). We performed additional preprocessing on our resting state data using the CONN toolbox (v17.f ), modeling head motion with 24 parameters, and regressing out signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (Behzadi et al.,  ), and temporally bandpass filtering between 0.008 Hz and 0.09 Hz. We generated seed regions of equivalent spatial extent from the thresholded results of the MKDA, eroding large clusters of equivalent values by smoothing and re-thresholding. Then, we calculated the difference in functional connectivity displayed by these two subregions by calculating the difference in seed-to-ROI temporal correlation coefficients for 131 ROIs included in CONN\u2019s default atlas, using a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.001. For the connectivity analyses, Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient values were used for comparison, and the reverse transform was applied to return connectivity coefficients to   r   values for ease of interpretation. This research study was approved by the local research ethics board (CHREB-22848). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Retrosplenial Cortex \n  \nFrom all 91 articles passing initial filtering, we identified 143 coordinates from 32 articles with a label including \u201cretrosplenial cortex.\u201d Figure   depicts a histogram of coordinate locations projected into the sagittal plane. Approximately 10% of reported coordinates lie within the callosal sulcus, i.e., the retrosplenial cortex as defined by Vogt et al. ( ). \n  \nPanel   (A)   depicts the frequency at which a coordinate label included \u201cRetrosplenial Cortex\u201d appeared within 2 mm of any given MNI Y, Z position, projected onto an MNI standard brain at   x   = 8 mm. Panel   (B)   depicts the volume of interest generated to encompass the brain tissue commonly referred to as \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d in the spatial cognition literature. \n  \n\n### Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis \n  \nWe performed an MKDA to identify regions within the retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate (Figure  ) that are preferentially involved in   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall  . Contrasts classified as   spatial encoding   were generally characterized by stimulus-driven activity in which participants viewed scenes or explored virtual environments, with no explicit demand to localize themselves or unseen landmarks. Contrasts classified as   spatial recall   included those with demands to recall the location of, or route to, landmarks in familiar environments, as well as contrasts that track environmental properties or knowledge (e.g., parametric contrasts with navigational performance or goal proximity). As shown in Figure  , the MKDA with a threshold of   p   < 0.001 revealed that   spatial encoding   was more likely to activate ventrolateral portions of the posterior cingulate (MNI centroids at \u221222, \u221260, 6; 333 voxels, and 20, \u221256, 6; 70 voxels), whereas   spatial recall   was more likely to activate dorsomedial portions of the posterior cingulate (MNI centroid 4, \u221260, 28; 847 voxels). These findings closely parallel the results reported in our previous study (Burles et al.,  ). A conjunction analysis did not detect any voxels engaged in both   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   (peak   t   = 3.719,   p   = 0.002062 at MNI \u221214, \u221260, 14). \n  \nMultilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) results depicting regions more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding   (red\/yellow) and   spatial recall   (blue\/green). Panels   (A\u2013C)   are displayed at MNI 8, \u221253, 5, color range bounds represent uncorrected thresholds of   p   < 0.01 at   t   = 2.69 and   p   < 0.001 at   t   = 3.50 in an 8385-voxel region of interest (Figure  ). Panel   (D)   displays a volumetric depiction of the significant clusters at   p   < 0.001. \n  \n\n### Subregion Functional Connectivity Characterization \n  \nFrom the results of the MKDA, we selected the ventro-lateral clusters totaling 403-voxels more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , and a dorso-medial cluster of 408 voxels more likely to be activated by   spatial recall   as seeds for a resting state functional connectivity analysis. Contrasting the functional connectivity profiles of these regions revealed significant differences across the brain, detailed in Supplementary Table S2. Across the 132 brain regions tested, the ventro-lateral and dorso-medial posterior cingulate seeds displayed significantly (  p   < 0.001) different connectivity patterns with 69 regions (i.e., 52% of tested regions). The ventro-lateral   spatial encoding   seed displayed significantly more positive functional connectivity with numerous occipital, lateral parietal, and ventral temporal regions. The dorso-medial   spatial recall   seed, on the other hand, was more positively functionally connected to the posterior cingulate, as well as the frontal pole and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (see Figure  ). \n  \nPanel   (A)   depicts the difference in functional connectivity between the ventro-lateral posterior cingulate seeds more associated with   spatial encoding  , and the dorso-medial posterior cingulate seed more associated with   spatial recall  . Highlighted regions display significantly different functional connectivity profiles at   p   < 0.001.   N   = 38. Panel   (B)   displays grouped histograms of the differences in functional connectivity; red highlighting for more positive functional connectivity with the   spatial encoding   seeds, and blue for more positive functional connectivity with the   spatial recall   seed. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the spatial cognition literature, the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label is used quite liberally for brain regions lying posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Even by Brodmann\u2019s original, overdrawn depiction, a substantial number of MRI peaks labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d drawn from the spatial orientation literature lie unequivocally outside of this anatomical region. It is likely that some of the \u201cleaking\u201d of the retrosplenial cortex into the posterior cingulate is not simply due to the rather large representation of the retrosplenial cortex in Brodmann\u2019s work, or the Talairach atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,  ), but also due to the long history of spatial orientation research in rodents. Rodents lack a clear homologous region to the human posterior cingulate (i.e., BA 23 and 31), and instead boast an expansive retrosplenial cortex (Vogt and Peters,  ). The human retrosplenial cortex label is applied in a manner that is potentially justifiable as functionally homologous to the rodent retrosplenial cortex, if not anatomically homologous. \n\nWhile this could be shrugged off as a simple case of difference in nomenclature, we would argue that the lack of specificity in the use of the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d label actively impedes generating a clear and precise understanding of how this region supports the cognitive processes involved in spatial orientation and navigation in humans. In the present study, we provided evidence that the large region that is commonly labeled \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d displays a relevant subregion specialization. We classified 114 contrasts from 91 articles as either   spatial encoding   or   spatial recall   and identified that within the \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d (more appropriately labeled as the posterior cingulate), ventral portions were more likely to be activated by   spatial encoding  , and dorsal portions more likely to be activated by   spatial recall  . \n\nThese findings are supported by a wide variety of previous research that have identified differences in cytology, as well as differences in functional and structural connectivity within this area (Vogt et al.,  ; Hagmann et al.,  ; Zhang and Li,  ; Bzdok et al.,  ; Silson et al.,  ; Burles et al.,  ), supporting the interpretation that the identified regions are involved in somewhat different cognitive processes. Indeed, we detected markedly different resting state functional connectivity profiles between the ventro-lateral,   spatial encoding  , cluster and the dorso-medial,   spatial recall  , cluster. The   spatial encoding   seeds were centered upon lateral portions of the anterior bank of the common trunk of the parietal-occipital fissure and calcarine sulcus, immediately ventral to where they join. This region displayed more positive functional connectivity coefficients with many ventral-stream, \u201cspatial context\u201d regions, such as the fusiform and lingual gyri (Milner and Goodale,  ), solidifying its characterization a relatively more involved in bottom-up or lower level perceptual processing and passive updating. In contrast, the   spatial recall   seed was centered 2 cm dorsal to the   spatial encoding   seeds, and displayed relatively greater resting state functional connectivity with regions commonly implicated in spatial manipulation, as well as spatial and episodic memory, such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus and frontal pole (Maddock et al.,  ; Okuda et al.,  ; Ridderinkhof et al.,  ; Wagner et al.,  ; Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Addis et al.,  ). \n\nWhile the ventral\u2014dorsal distinction between these subregions was distinct, the   spatial encoding   clusters occupied a relatively more lateral position, deeply tucked within the parietal-occipital fissure. This localization is consistent with previous work by Silson et al. ( ), who localized the scene-sensitive region of the medial parietal cortex as within the parietal-occipital fissure, immediately dorsal to the junction with the calcarine sulcus. This region was characterized by a strong contralateral visual field bias, a property shared with other scene-sensitive cortex (i.e., the occipital and parahippocampal place areas). However, Silson et al. ( ) also described a region immediately anterior and medial to the functionally-localized scene-selective cortex, and noted this region was relatively less scene-sensitive and displayed relatively lower functional connectivity with the posterior parahippocampal place area and occipital place area, but relatively greater functional connectivity with the precuneus, superior frontal, and orbitofrontal cortex. The authors suggest that these regions may constitute partially different scene-processing networks, as proposed by Baldassano et al. ( ). In this paradigm, more lateral scene-sensitive would be relatively more involved in processing visual features, whereas more medial and anterior cortex, approaching or including the retrosplenial cortex proper, appear to be more strongly integrated with the hippocampus and potentially involved in navigation or more general episodic memory processes. Notably, the present meta-analysis did not appear to be sensitive to this region, but this may explain why the   spatial encoding   clusters were sequestered to the lateral portions of the parieto-occipital fissure, as more medial and anterior regions may be involved in processes that are poorly characterized by the   spatial encoding   and   spatial recall   paradigm we adopted. \n\nIn conclusion, we believe that the identification of detectable subregions within the posterior cingulate warrants a more precise and nuanced manner in which we discuss and report the results of neuroimaging findings in this region. While the number and location of the particular clusters identified in this meta-analysis likely do not represent   the   relevant subregions of this brain area, we do feel that some simple considerations can be taken into account to reduce the ambiguity of the retrosplenial cortex\u2019s position and role in cognition. First, we would suggest reserving the label \u201cretrosplenial cortex\u201d for peaks which reside within the callosal sulcus, or at least are closer to the callosal sulcus than the parietal-occipital fissure, especially at MNI z positions above +10 mm. Further, for the peaks in the posterior cingulate but in the vicinity of the retrosplenial cortex proper, it may be valuable to begin making the distinction between more ventral and dorsal regions; using the point at which the calcarine sulcus joins with the parietal-occipital fissure as an easily-identifiable landmark for differentiation, or at least reference, as our findings would indicate that regions ventral and significantly dorsal to this point may not be functionally homogenous. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nFB and GI conceived and designed the study.

Recent studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural networks subserving verbal fluency functions have yielded divergent results especially with respect to a parcellation of the inferior frontal gyrus for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. We conducted a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on brain activation during the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks involving 28 individual studies with 490 healthy volunteers. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor phonemic as well as for semantic verbal fluency, the most prominent clusters of brain activation were found in the left inferior\/middle frontal gyrus (LIFG\/MIFG) and the anterior cingulate gyrus. BA 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks, BA 45 and 47 in the processing of phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur comparison of brain activation during the execution of either phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks revealed evidence for spatially different activation in BA 44, but not other regions of the LIFG\/LMFG (BA 9, 45, 47) during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nVerbal fluency constitutes an executive function which is impaired in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Tests of verbal fluency are amongst the most widely used measures to assess executive functioning [ ]. These tests assess the ability to generate words [ ]. The pre-determined categories of verbal fluency tasks can be phonemic or semantic in nature [ ]. In standard clinical versions, subjects are given one minute to generate object names from a given category (semantic fluency) or words beginning with a specific letter (phonemic fluency). \n\nNeuroimaging investigations have shown that verbal fluency relies on the coordinated activity of a number of brain areas, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes of the left hemisphere. Damage to the left frontal lobe, especially to the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has consistently been shown to impair verbal fluency performance [ - ]. Findings from previous studies suggest that phonemic verbal fluency relies on a partially different network of brain regions [ , ]. Studies have shown that frontal lobe damage results in impairment to phonemic fluency, whereas temporal lobe damages rather impair semantic than phonemic verbal fluency [ - ]. Furthermore, a functional dissociation of the LIFG along semantic-phonological domain lines has been suggested [ , , , ]. The anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45, 47) is supposed to be specifically involved in the processing of semantic information whereas the posterior-dorsal LIFG (BA 44) seems to be specifically recruited for the use of phonological information [ , , ]. On the other hand, there is evidence that the same LIFG regions are involved in the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks [ ]. \n\n### Aims of the study \n  \nMeta-analytic methods allow the investigation of shared brain activation across individual studies by quantitatively identifying brain locations that are consistently associated with tasks or cognitive functions of interest. We applied the activation likelihood estimation technique as implemented in the GingerALE software [ - ] in order to study the brain activation during the processing of verbal fluency tasks. \n\nAs previous studies revealed contradictory results on whether the same or different brain regions are involved in the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis separated for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency as well as a subtraction analysis of the activated brain regions in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Based on previous results, we mainly expected cerebral activation during the processing of verbal fluency tasks in the left prefrontal lobe, particularly in the LIFG [ ]. In a second step, we tested the hypothesized functional dissociation of the LIFG along semantic-phonological domain lines and expected that the posterior-dorsal LIFG is primarily involved in the processing of the phonemic verbal fluency tasks and the anterior-ventral LIFG in the processing of the semantic fluency tasks [ , , , ]. \n\nAn important and very influential first systematic review of fMRI studies on verbal fluency [ ] compared the activation patterns of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks within the LIFG. The authors used bootstrap methods to calculate and compare the confidence intervals of the mean x-, y-, and z-coordinates between the two fluency tasks. The results support distinct dorsal-ventral locations for phonemic and semantic processes within the LIFG. Some individual studies comprised in this review included bilingual participants, right and left handed subjects as well as of individuals with right- and left-hemisphere dominance. Some previous fMRI studies suggested that bilingual individuals might have a greater increase in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the LIFG (Brodman Area (BA) 45) than monolinguals [ ]. Furthermore, there is evidence that left-handed individuals demonstrate a reverse speech organization in comparison to right-handed persons [ , ]. Right-hemisphere dominant language individuals on the other hand may exhibit a mirror reverse pattern of activation as compared to left-hemisphere dominant subjects [ ]. In order to reduce variability and avoid issues of mixed language dominance, we restricted our analysis to right handed monolingual subjects. By reducing the inter-individual variation of the participants due to lateralization, handedness, and language background, and the inclusion of new original studies the current meta-analysis set out to replicate, validate and extend the results of the study of Costafreda and colleagues [ ]. Here we applied the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique, which is a widely used, validated, automated and quantitative method for a voxel-wise meta-analysis of neuroimaging foci. Furthermore, we used subtraction analysis in order to directly compare the activation maps of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Included studies and participants \n  \nWe performed a coordinate-based quantitative meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (14-16, available at  ). Results from neuroimaging studies of experiments on phonemic and\/or semantic verbal fluency were included. The following inclusion criteria were used to select the studies: i) studies in peer-reviewed journals published in English; ii) use of active task-based functional MRI or PET neuroimaging techniques; iii) the sample consisted of right handed, healthy adult subjects of both sexes with a mean age\u2009\u2264\u200960 years; iv) results were reported using stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates; v) the field of view covered the whole brain. \n\n\n### Search strategy for identification of studies \n  \nPeer-reviewed papers published in English were identified through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycLit, Biological Abstracts Dissertation Abstracts Online and Mental Health Abstracts using the search terms: \u201cverbal fluency, phonemic verbal fluency, semantic verbal fluency, executive functions, and healthy control subjects. These terms were each combined (\u201cAND\u201d) with \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cposition emission tomography\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cPET\u201d or \u201cneuroimaging\u201d in order to identify the relevant functional imaging studies. We subsequently checked the reference sections of the publications that we found through our search, in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed. The search was conducted without any restriction of publication date or language used in the experiment. Direct e-mail communication with some researchers also provided additional data sets. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers (SW, AT) independently conducted the literature search, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials and screened the studies for the above mentioned inclusion criteria. In case of disagreement between the reviewers, the disagreement was resolved by consensus discussion with one senior author of the research team (OT). To achieve a high standard of reporting, we adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the revised Quality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) statement [ ]. \n\n\n### Outcome measures \n  \nAll studies used a block design including alternating blocks of the verbal fluency tasks with a baseline task (phonemic\u2009>\u2009baseline; semantic\u2009>\u2009baseline; for a detailed description of the baseline tasks see Tables\u00a0  and  ). The tasks were presented auditory or visually during the investigation. Subjects were required to generate their responses overtly or covertly (see Tables\u00a0  and  ). In all studies, subjects were asked to generate a word after they had heard an acoustic cue or seen a fixation cross on a monitor. In the phonemic verbal fluency task, subjects had to produce as many words as possible beginning with a specific letter. In the semantic verbal fluency task, a semantic category (e.g., animals or fruits) was presented instead of a letter. The participants were asked to generate an object name from the given category after each acoustic or visual cue. \n  \nStudies included in the meta-analysis \n  \np: phonemic; s: semantic; uc\u2009=\u2009uncorrected; c\u2009=\u2009corrected; these studies seperately investigated the activation for easy and hard verbal fluency tasks, coordinates were included for easy tasks only; these studies seperately investigated the activation of females and males, coordinates were included seperately for males and females; family wise error rate corrected; ROI; Monte Carlo corrected; false discovery rate corrected; 3 foci in females, 12 foci in males; 23 foci in females, 18 foci in males; MNI: Montreal Neurological Institut. \n    \nStimulus material of the included studies \n  \nOutcome measures of the meta-analysis were the activation peaks of healthy control subjects during the processing of phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks. We included only those studies in our analysis, which reported activation as contrasted to a baseline condition in a healthy control group. Theoretical papers and reviews were excluded. Studies reporting combined group results and a region-of-interest analysis or only brain-behavior correlations, or did not report activation foci as 3-D coordinates in stereotactic space were excluded because these studies could not be meaningfully analyzed with ALE. Two studies reported results for men and women separately. In this case, we included the coordinates of males and females as two independent studies. In studies investigating easy and hard letters or categories, we selected the easy condition, because it was more comparable to the stimulus material in the other included studies. \n\n\n### Statistical procedures \n  \nThe X, Y, Z coordinates of every significant peak for all eligible contrasts constituted the input to the meta-analysis. All analyses were performed in the MNI reference space. Coordinates that were reported in Talairach space were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates [ ]. An ALE meta-analysis separated for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency was calculated according to the procedure described by Turkeltaub et al., [ ] and Laird et al., [ ], using the algorithm revised by Eickhoff et al., [ ] and Turkeltaub et al., [ ], which has been implemented in the GingerALE software. The ALE meta-analysis was executed using a random effects model (non-additive HBM, 22) implemented in GingerALE 2.1.1 ( ). A new algorithm was employed which consists of three steps resulting in an ALE map that is unbiased by the number of foci or contrasts included from each study [ , ]. The ALE algorithm delineates in which brain regions the convergence across all included imaging studies is higher than it would be expected if the results were independently distributed [ ]. The three steps of the ALE analyses are as follows: (1) localization uncertainty is modeled for each focus of activity as a Gaussian distribution, the width of which is determined from the number of subjects of the study; (2) taking the union of the study-specific localization probabilities identified for each voxel yields the voxel-wise ALE value; (3) significance is tested using a random-effects method with a null hypothesis that the location of activation in each study is independent from the other studies [ ]. Accordingly generated ALE maps were thresholded at p <0.05 using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction and a minimum clusters size of 100\u00a0mm . For each of the resulting significant clusters, we additionally considered the number of studies that contributed to each. In order to ensure that the reported results represented coherence across multiple experiments, we eliminated ALE clusters and peaks that were based on less than three different studies [ , ]. Visualization of the results was implemented with MRIcron, using the Colin brain template in MNI space. \n\nIn a first step, we performed a ALE meta-analysis of all studies investigating phonemic (studies 1 to 21) verbal fluency tasks. After that we repeated this analysis with all studies using semantic verbal fluency tasks (studies 16-28). Results for phonemic verbal fluency tasks are shown in Table\u00a0 , for semantic fluency tasks in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nRegions with significant activation during phonematic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nN: number of studies reporting at least one activation peak; Coodinates: MNI Space; mm : cubic millimeter; BA: Brodman Area. \n    \nRegions with significant activation during semantic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nN: number of studies reporting at least one activation peak; Coodinates: MNI Space; mm : cubic millimeter; BA: Brodman Area. \n  \nIn a second step we determined the difference between the phonemic and semantic ALE images (Figure\u00a0 ) by a subtraction analysis. The subtraction analysis allows a formal comparison of the difference between the two ALE maps (phonemic vs. semantic). For this purpose we used the thresholded NIfTI images from dataset A (i.e., \u201cphonemic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05), dataset B (i.e., \u201csemantic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05), and a pooled dataset A\u2009+\u2009B (i.e., \u201cphonemic and semantic\u201d, at p\u2009<\u20090.05). Regional differences between the phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks were tested by performing the ALE meta-analysis separately for each fluency task and computing the voxel-wise difference between the resultant ALE maps. Subtracting the ALE values calculated from semantic verbal fluency tasks from those calculated from phonemic fluency tasks gives a measure of the difference in convergence in the two maps. \n  \nPRISMA flow chart of the literature search. \n  \nCaution should be exercised when carrying out formal comparisons of ALE meta-analyses when the groups are disparate in total number of foci. In these cases, it is impossible to say with any certainty whether the difference maps reflect activation difference across groups of studies or simply show the effect of one group having a greater number of coordinates [ ]. Because the number of studies and foci in the phonemic verbal fluency task was significantly higher than in the semantic verbal fluency task, the resulting difference in power between the two tasks may affect the results of the subtraction analysis. In order to improve the sensitivity of the subtraction analysis and increase the number of studies and foci included in the semantic verbal fluency map, we added the coordinates of the semantic verbal fluency tasks included in the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency to the semantic part of the subtraction analysis. Thus, data set A (\u201cphonemic\u201d) of the subtraction analysis included studies 1 to 15, data set B (\u201csemantic\u201d) studies 16 to 28 and the pooled data set studies 1 to 28. \n\nA prerequisite of the subtraction analysis of GingerALE is that the number of included studies, subjects and foci of the pooled data set (A\u2009+\u2009B) has to be the exact sum of the number of studies, subjects and foci of data sets A and B. If we had included the coordinates of the phonemic verbal fluency tasks of the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency in the subtraction analysis as well, this prerequisite would have no longer been fulfilled and it had not been possible to execute the subtraction analysis. \n\nA minimum of at least 8 to 10 experiments should be included in an ALE meta-analysis in order to get valid results (Prof. S. Eickhoff, author of GingerALE, personal communication). According to the failure report of GingerALE, the subtraction analysis should include a minimum of at least 15 studies in each data set in order to provide enough statistical power. Thus, the small number of included studies, specifically in the analysis of the semantic verbal fluency map, must be kept in mind when interpreting the results of our subtraction analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe search identified 254 studies which were screened by title and abstract. 196 of these studies had to be excluded because they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. The full text of the remaining 58 studies was scrutinized by two independent reviewers (SW, AT). Thirty of these studies were excluded from analyses: ten studies because the y-, x-, and z-coordinates were not reported, seven because the results were not separated for patients and controls, six studies did not include healthy control subjects, two included identical participants as Krug et al. 2011, one study had no baseline condition and one included a switching verbal fluency task. Finally, 28 studies investigating healthy volunteers were included in our meta-analysis. Fifteen studies assessed phonemic verbal fluency, seven studies semantic verbal fluency, and six studies both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency (Figure\u00a0 ). \n\nAcross the included studies, 490 healthy control subjects (60% men, 40% women) were analyzed. Mean age of the included participants was 30.8\u00a0years (range: 21 \u2013 56.7\u00a0years). The 21 studies assessing phonemic verbal fluency yielded 245 foci inside the MNI space; the 13 studies investigating semantic verbal fluency performance yielded 117 foci. The coordinates of these studies were entered into two separate ALE meta-analyses to test for regional concordance within phonemic or semantic verbal fluency as well as in a subtraction analysis in order to assess significant differences in the brain activation during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. \n\n### Phonemic verbal fluency \n  \nThe search identified 21 studies comprising 23 experiments investigating the brain activation during phonemic verbal fluency tasks, including 307 healthy volunteers. The meta-analysis of the coordinates revealed one cluster covering the LIFG\/LMFG (BA 6, 9, 44 & 45) and left insula (BA 13) as well as an additional cluster located in the left and right anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24, 32) as well as one in the right insula and frontal lobe (BA 44, 47). A further cluster revealed activation of the left thalamus. Additionally, we found several brain regions of concordance located in the left precuneus (BA 7) and putamen as well as in the right Claustrum and Caudate Head. \n\n\n### Semantic verbal fluency \n  \nThirteen studies including 292 healthy volunteers were analyzed. The meta-analysis of the coordinates revealed clusters of brain activation in the left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in the left superior (BA 6, 8) and medial frontal gyrus (BA 6) (Figure\u00a0 ; Table\u00a0 ). Furthermore, we found brain activation in the LIFG (BA 9, 45) as well as one cluster covering the left claustrum and LIFG (BA 47). Additional clusters comprised the LIFG (BA 47), the left Thalamus and Precuneus (BA 7). \n  \n Shows the significant cluster of brain activation in the processing of verbal fluency, threshold: p <0.05 using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction and a minimum clusters size of 100\u00a0mm3.   Data are shown in neurological convention (R\u2009=\u2009R, L\u2009=\u2009L; R: right; L: left). \n  \n\n### Subtraction analysis \n  \nA subtraction analysis of the experiments using phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks was performed. The phonemic fluency data set included 17 experiments reporting 193 foci (N\u2009=\u2009196), the semantic data set 13 experiments reporting 117 foci (N\u2009=\u2009298) and the pooled data set 30 experiments yielding 310 foci (N\u2009=\u2009494). The subtraction of the phonemic versus semantic verbal fluency map revealed no significant differences in the ALE maps. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we report the results of a coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis of the brain activation during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks in healthy volunteers. The main clusters of brain activation were seen in the left frontal lobe, specifically the IFG, MFG and medial frontal gyrus (BA 6, 9, 44, 45, 47), as well as in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) (BA 24, 33). These results confirm previous studies suggesting that brain regions primarily in the left prefrontal gyrus, particularly in the LIFG and LMFG, are involved in word production and speech processing in verbal fluency tasks [ , - ]. Regarding the ACC, phonemic verbal fluency tasks predominantly activated the left (BA 32, 24) and right ACC (BA 32), semantic verbal fluency tasks only the left ACC (BA 32). This is in line with previous studies suggesting that the cingulate gyrus (BA 32, 24) is activated during word generation and may therefore reflect the attentional demands of verbal fluency tasks [ , , ]. Patients with bilateral anterior cerebral infarction for example often suffer from akinetic mutism and verbal fluency deficits. Furthermore, blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24) increases during the processing of single words or letters [ ]. \n\nThe left parietal precuneus (BA 7) was activated in the processing of phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. The precuneus (BA 7) is involved in phonemic discrimination and working memory [ , , , ] and was repeatedly associated with the processing of phonological information. Furthermore, this region plays a central role in visual attention of stimuli and speech. \n\nFurther cluster of activation included the left and right insula, left Thalamus and Putamen as well as the right Claustrum and Caudate Head. Another cluster of activation was seen in the cerebellum. There is evidence that the (left) sub-lobar insula is involved in speech processing and the execution of verbal fluency tasks [ ]. Specifically the left anterior insula has been suggested to be involved in the articulatory planning of orofacial movements [ ]. A systematic review of Price reports that speech production leads to an increased activation in the cerebellum, the anterior insula as well as in the left Putamen [ ]. The ACC and head of caudate have been found to be involved in word selection. The initiation and execution of movements during speech production increase the activation in the left putamen. The thalamus has also been shown to be involved in the processing of verbal fluency [ ]. \n\n### Brain activation in the processing of phonemic versus semantic verbal fluency tasks \n  \nAs can be seen in Tables\u00a0  and  , Brodman area 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks, whereas BA 9, 45 and 47 were activated in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. The result that BA 44 was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks is in line with previous studies which suggested that the posterior-dorsal LIFG (BA 44) is specifically involved in the processing of phonemic information [ , , ]. Phonemic fluency is most likely triggered by subvocal syllabification that overlaps with processes of inner speech such as motor programming and articulation, as indicated by stronger activations of posterior LIFG (BA 44; Figure\u00a0 , blue) close to adjacent (pre)motor areas [ ]. \n\nContrary to the hypothesis that the anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45, 47) is specifically involved in the processing of semantic information, BA 45 and 47 were activated in the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks. Previous studies also revealed an activation of BA 45 and 47 in the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks [ , , ]. These results are consistent with assumptions that phonological search processes are not exclusively based on phonemic information, but may also rely on semantic facilitation [ ]. A variety of previous studies failed to find evidence for the hypothesis that semantic processing preferentially activates anterior ventro-lateral regions of the PFC when compared to phonological processing [ , - ]. A recent study directly comparing phonemic vs. semantic verbal fluency tasks while controlling for the effects of task demand implies that activity in the anterior-ventral LIFG (BA 45) is mainly related to task demand and individual ability [ ]. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that the posterior LIFG is specialized for the use of phonemic material but failed to confirm the hypothesis that the anterior LIFG is specifically involved in the processing of semantic information. \n\nThe subtraction analysis revealed no cluster of significantly greater activation during the processing of phonemic than during semantic verbal fluency tasks. Previous studies suggested that caution should be exercised carrying out formal comparisons of ALE meta-analyses when the two data sets are disparate in the total number of foci. In these cases, it is impossible to say with any certainty whether the difference maps reflect activation difference across groups of studies or simply show the effect of one group having a greater number of coordinates [ ]. In order to improve the sensitivity of the subtraction analysis and increase the number of foci included in the semantic verbal fluency map, we added the coordinates of the semantic verbal fluency tasks included in the six studies which investigated both phonemic and semantic verbal fluency to the semantic part of the subtraction analysis. Thus, data set A (\u201cphonemic\u201d) of the subtraction analysis included 15 studies, data set B (\u201csemantic\u201d) 13 studies. In our previous analysis, the subtraction analysis revealed a greater activation during phonemic than semantic verbal fluency tasks in a cluster in the left LIFG. Due to the inclusion of two additional semantic verbal fluency studies in the analyses of the revised manuscript, the subtraction analysis did not longer reveal different activation patterns in phonemic compared to semantic verbal fluency tasks. The observed difference of activation in the previous analysis may be the result of power differences between the two tasks, because the number of the included studies and foci in the phonemic verbal fluency task was significantly higher than in the semantic verbal fluency task. The fact that the clusters of activation in the left hemisphere coincided in phonemic (Table\u00a0 ) and semantic (Table\u00a0 ) verbal fluency tasks except for BA 24 (ACC) and 7 (Putamen) substantiate this assumption. \n\nPreviously, a domain specific activation in the left posterior temporal cortex near the middle temporal gyrus for semantic processing was found [ , , , ]. In the current meta-analysis, activation of the left temporal gyrus in the processing of semantic verbal fluency tasks as previously reported [ - , ] could not be replicated. This may be due to the lower overall activation in semantic verbal fluency tasks and the lower number of semantic verbal fluency studies included in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe studies included in our meta-analysis differed regarding design, methodology, and the study population. As shown in Tables\u00a0  and  , the included studies differ in their stimulus material, baseline condition and language (English, German, Dutch or Japanese) as well as in the kind of stimulus presentation (auditory versus visually) and response generation (overt versus covert). These differences might have affected the results of our analysis. \n\nThe included experiments used two different types of baseline conditions. Twenty-two of the 28 experiments (15 of 21 phonemic and 2 of 13 semantic fluency experiments) involved a covert or overt repetition of a given word (\u201crest\u201d) or of a familiar sequence (e.g., forward counting, days of the week or month of the year). The performance of such standardized language production requires at least some low-level phonologic processing. When subtracted from the experimental tasks, they would at its best attenuate phonologic activity in the final images, which is most likely localized to the more posterior and dorsal areas of the LIFG [ , ]. Consequently, most phonemic experiments may have underestimated the extent of phonologic activity. The second type of baseline condition was a passive task, such as silent rest or visual fixation of a cross or symbol. There is some evidence that a functionally connected brain network including the LIFG might be associated with resting states [ - ]. In this framework, the effects would be opposite to those using a standardized language production baseline task. Semantic activity would then be underestimated in semantic experiments, which used a resting state (two of thirteen semantic experiments) baseline condition. \n\nThe performance in verbal fluency tasks depends on the difficulty of the stimulus material. As can be seen in Table\u00a0 , the majority of English and German phonemic verbal fluency studies used variations of the COWAT stimulus material (FAS) additional to further letters. The use of different stimulus material could have affected our results because previous studies suggested that the CFL subtest of the COWAT is more difficult than the FAS subtest [ ]. Lacy and colleagues [ ] on the other hand revealed a comparable performance in the two forms of the COWAT. Borowski and colleagues [ ] investigated the association between different letters and their difficulty. Based on the frequency of the generated words, the authors categorized H, D, M, W, A, B, F, P, T, C, S as easy English letters, I, O, N, E, G, L, R as moderately difficult letters and Q, J, V, Y, K, and U as hard letters. According to this classification, the included studies of our meta-analysis only used easy to moderate letters. The most frequently used categories were furniture (6 of 13), animals (5 of 13) as well as fruits, food, body parts (4 of 13) and vegetables, cloths and colors (3 of 13). \n\nThe majority of the participants in the current meta-analysis were native English or German speakers, one study consisted of Dutch participants, one of Japanese individuals. The fact that different languages use different strategies for encoding grammatically information leads to the question whether an unitary network of brain regions specialized for processing grammar in a broad sense is involved in the processing of different human languages, or whether different languages impose distinct processing demands relying on non-identical neural mechanisms. Previous studies on language dependent processing of verbal material suggest that different brain networks are involved in the processing of different languages [ , ]. The language of the included studies might accordingly have affected the activation patterns. However, a secondary analysis excluding the Dutch and Japanese studies revealed the same results than the first analysis. Furthermore, Oberg and Ramirez [ ] suggested that as long as the letter frequency was considered, the number of generated words were remarkably similar across different languages. \n\nSubjects generated covert responses in 7 of 21 phonemic studies and 6 of 13 semantic, verbal fluency tasks. Whereas overt paradigms hold a risk to produce movement artifacts, covert verbal responses do not allow to determine whether the subjects perform the task as instructed and to assess the task performance [ ]. Because of the differences between covert and overt verbal fluency paradigms, it seems to be difficult to generalize the results from covert response paradigms to overt response paradigms. Furthermore, it is possible that the cognitive processes operating during covert verbal responding are different in some aspects to those operating during overt verbal responding. Although a direct comparison of overt and covert responses in a stem completion task showed greater LIFG activation with overt than covert responses, the location of the peak of activation did not differ [ ]. In order to clarify the effect of the response generation on the brain activation, we statistically compared the two sets of foci by subtracting the ALE maps of the overt and covert verbal fluency tasks. The covert fluency data set included 14 experiments reporting 122 foci, the overt data set 17 experiments reporting 255 foci and the pooled data set 31 experiments yielding 377 foci. The subtraction of the covert versus overt verbal fluency maps resulted in a higher activation likelihood in the LIFG (BA 46; X: -52; Y: 27; Z: 17; 1816\u00a0mm ). No significant differences were seen subtracting the overt from covert verbal fluency map. The auditory presented fluency data set included 18 experiments reporting 184 foci, the visually presented data set 13 experiments reporting 178 foci and the pooled data set 31 experiments yielding 362 foci. Auditory presentation of the stimuli resulted in a significantly greater activation in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 8; 312\u00a0mm ) and left Insula (BA 13, 160\u00a0mm ). \n\nRegarding gender differences in the performance of verbal fluency tasks, previous studies revealed heterogeneous results. Among the functional imaging verbal fluency studies focusing on sex differences, no study has highlighted a statistically significant behavioral difference between groups of men and women. No activation difference was found for men and women selected either on the basis of a same high level of VF performance or on differential cognitive performances (5; 60). Furthermore, a variety of non-imaging studies investigating the verbal fluency performance of healthy subjects also did not found differences between men and women in their phonemic or semantic verbal fluency performance [ - ]. On the other hand, Gauthier and colleagues [ ] reported sex effects in a sample of high performers in seven cortical structures (the left ITG, anterior and posterior cingulate, right ACC, SFG, dlPFC and lingual gyrus) during the processing of a phonemic verbal fluency paradigm. The majority of the included studies in our meta-analysis investigated the brain activation during verbal fluency tasks in a sample of men and women without consideration of gender (Tables\u00a0  and  ). Thus, we were not able to identify the activation patterns separately for men and women. \n\nIn conclusion, the aim of our meta-analysis was to compare the brain activation during the processing of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency. Tables\u00a0  and   show that the number of studies using German or English language, a visually or auditory presentation of the stimulus material or an overt or covert paradigm was comparable between the studies investigating phonemic or semantic verbal fluency. Thus, we would suggest that the effect of these confounding variables on brain activity was equally distributed in phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Nevertheless, future studies are needed which investigate the brain activation during verbal fluency tasks separately for studies using different designs with respect to stimulus presentation, language or response generation, respectively. The number of included studies in our meta-analysis, specifically in the analysis of semantic verbal fluency tasks, was too small to compare subgroups of studies presenting the stimulus material visually or auditory or using overt or covert paradigms. \n\nCoordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses usually pool studies that have different statistic thresholds. As can be seen in Tables\u00a0  and  , the statistical threshold of the individual studies of our meta-analysis ranges from strict family-wise error rate correction to uncorrected p-values of p\u2009<\u20090.005. Assuming equality across studies irrespective of their statistical threshold could have the consequence of giving more weight to studies using less strict statistical thresholds, as these are likely to report more significant findings than studies using stricter statistical thresholds [ ]. In our meta-analysis, six studies used an uncorrected statistical threshold. Additional file  : Table S1 and S2 show the number of foci from each experiment contributing to the significant clusters of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. With 9 and 5 foci, respectively, the study of Abrahams and colleagues [ ] contributed by far the most foci to cluster 1 and 2 of phonemic verbal fluency. However, in the other five studies with uncorrected statistical thresholds, it could not be observed that they report more significant findings than the studies using stricter statistical thresholds. \n\nA further limitation of our meta-analysis might be that the power of the analyses cannot be aggregated across the included studies, because the GingerALE software is not suited to correct for false negative results [ ]. On the other hand, this also means that ALE minimizes the risk of false positive results and is not susceptible for outlier effects. Meta-analytic results are often influenced by the heterogeneity of the included studies. Therefore, it is an aim of meta-analysis to statistically control for potential sources of heterogeneity. The ALE software did not allow the investigation of heterogeneity between the individual studies; therefore, we cannot fully exclude that the results might be influenced by a possible heterogeneity of the individual studies. Nevertheless, we tried to minimize the heterogeneity through the definition of relatively strict inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the new ALE algorithm is based on a random effects model, which is more conservative than the fixed-effects model and incorporates both within-study and between study variance. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current meta-analysis investigated the brain activation of healthy volunteers during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Our analyses corroborate the involvement of the left inferior\/middle frontal gyrus (BA 6, 9, 45, 46, 48) as well as the ACC in the processing of verbal fluency tasks. Our comparison of brain activation during the execution of either phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks revealed evidence for spatially different activation patterns in the posterior but not the anterior regions of the LIFG\/LMFG during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing. \n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nAT has received research funding from Rules based medicine Inc., Austin, Texas, USA.
