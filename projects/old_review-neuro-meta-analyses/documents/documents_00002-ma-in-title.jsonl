Studies on the offspring of patients with bipolar disorder who are genetically at HR have each been limited in establishing a biomarker, while an analytic review in summarizing the findings offers an improvised opportunity toward that goal. \n\n Methods:   An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of mixed cognitive and emotional activities using the GingerALE software from the BrainMap Project was completed. The meta-analysis of all fMRI studies contained a total of 29 reports and included PBD, HR, and typically developing (TD) groups. \n\n Results:   The HR group showed significantly greater activation relative to the TD group in the right DLPFC\u2013insular\u2013parietal\u2013cerebellar regions. Similarly, the HR group exhibited greater activity in the right DLPFC and insula as well as the left cerebellum compared to patients with PBD. Patients with PBD, relative to TD, showed greater activation in regions of the right amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, medial PFC, left ventral striatum, and cerebellum and lower activation in the right VLPFC and the DLPFC. \n\n Conclusion:   The HR population showed increased activity, presumably indicating greater compensatory deployment, in relation to both the TD and the PBD, in the key cognition and emotion-processing regions, such as the DLPFC, insula, and parietal cortex. In contrast, patients with PBD, relative to HR and TD, showed decreased activity, which could indicate a decreased effort in multiple PFC regions in addition to widespread subcortical abnormalities, which are suggestive of a more entrenched disease process. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe relationship between pediatric and adult bipolar disorder has been the subject of controversy. It is not clear whether pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is the pediatric form of the typical adult bipolar disorder or an entity of its own, as bipolar disorder usually manifests differently in childhood than in adulthood. Some studies in adults have reported that a portion of adults with bipolar I disorder experienced childhood or adolescent onset, and some of them began showing symptoms even before 12\u2009years of age ( ,  ). Identifying early markers of brain function among those at high risk (HR) for PBD could serve as a screening measure when children and adolescents present with subsyndromal clinical symptoms prior to the conversion to bipolar disorder (pediatric or adult form). These biomarkers can also aid as a stand-alone bio-signature for the identification of risk even prior to the emergence of any clinical symptoms and could allow an opportunity to prevent the onset of full-blown illness ( ). One way to begin identifying the biomarkers is to examine the brain function in the genetically HR offspring of patients with bipolar disorder. While some studies of HR have been published ( \u2013 ), due to their small sample sizes and corrections for multiple comparisons, the findings remain inconclusive. \n\nTo offer robust and reliable findings, we used a recently developed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique. This method assumes that the peak co-ordinates reported by each study represent the activation maps from which they are derived and uses the reported co-ordinates in voxel-wise analysis to assess the consistency of activation in any given set of studies ( \u2013 ). By performing the quantitative voxel-wise meta-analysis of already published results from the HR population and comparing them with those from the converted PBD and typically developing (TD) youth, we can provide objective, unbiased, and statistically based quantified evidence. \n\nIdeally, a separate meta-analysis would be conducted for each individual domain, such as emotion processing or attention, as they relate to bipolar disorder diathesis. However, given the infancy of the current literature regarding HR patients, this is not practical, as no individual construct has included a sufficient number of studies to date. Instead, it is more feasible to study the commonalities probed across multiple domains in a systematic and statistically driven fashion. There is a certain advantage to combining all the studies that include multi-domain probes. First, the brain does not work in isolation across individual domains; therefore, it is necessary to examine the brain\u2019s function as a whole while it is engaged in affective, cognitive, and motor control tasks ( ). Furthermore, pooling several pilot studies produces an exploratory power of how the brain functions in a larger sample, eventually offering the possibility of correlating the results with the clinical manifestations of domains and disorders presenting with combined affective, cognitive, and motoric symptoms ( ). This approach is a segue into future studies that can explore the interface of multiple domain functions in individual studies. \n\nWe consider emotional systems and circuits, in illness or wellness, to be closely linked to cognitive and motor control circuits of attention, working memory, and response inhibition ( ). These systems interface at three tiers as shown in animal ( ) and human studies of PBD ( ): (1) at the prefrontal level between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [VLPFC; inferior frontal gyrus; Brodmann areas (BAs) 45, 47] and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; middle frontal gyrus; BAs 9, 9, 46), (2) at the intermediary cortex in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), such as between the dorsal (BA 32) and pregenual ACC (BA 24), and (3) at the subcortical level between the amygdala and striatum ( ). While we could not determine which probe or domain dysfunction would contribute to activity in any given co-ordinate in this meta-analysis, we developed our hypotheses based on knowledge derived from the emerging literature. Emotion-processing tasks probing the affective systems entered into our meta-analysis would contribute to the increased prefrontal activity at the interface of VLPFC and DLPFC in HR and the decreased activity in PBD relative to TD ( ). Increased subcortical amygdala activity would be a specific marker of PBD ( ) relative to HR and TD. Based on our knowledge of attention and working memory task response, the DLPFC will manifest with increased activity in HR ( ) and decreased activity in PBD ( ), relative to TD. Impaired subcortical striatal activity would be a more entrenched specific marker of PBD\u2019s cognitive and motor dysfunction ( ,  ,  ) relative to the HR and TD groups. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nWe identified primary studies through a comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE (using both free-text and MeSH search) and PsychINFO databases using the following keywords: pediatric or child or adolescent, plus bipolar disorder or high-risk or at risk, and plus functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI. In addition, manual searches were conducted via reference sections of review articles and individual studies to check for any missing studies that were not identified using computerized searches. There were no language restrictions; in fact, all the included manuscripts were written in English. Only fMRI studies were chosen for review. An initial list of studies was produced that included any report of fMRI studies of PBD and HR offspring published in print or online by December 31, 2013. The selection process for the final list of primary studies for the planned meta-analyses in this study was very specific. The first-level literature search yielded 235 unique published articles with 49 studies meeting the initial inclusion criteria. A further manual search leads to eight other studies. After a second-level review of these 57 studies, only 29 contained the co-ordinates essential for inclusion in our meta-analysis (Figure  ). Any ambiguity in inclusion was resolved through a consensus decision by the authors of this manuscript. Study data (e.g., co-ordinates, participant numbers, and imaging spaces) were entered and crosschecked by participating authors. \n  \n Flow chart of the literature search for included studies  . \n  \n\n### Selection criteria \n  \n\u201cHigh risk\u201d in this project refers to adolescents who have a biological parent diagnosed with BD. We selected studies with participants whose mean age was less than 19\u2009years. Every study that we included had participants between the ages of 7 and 18 except for the study performed by Thermenos et al. ( ), where the ages ranged up to 24. All reports included in the meta-analysis satisfied the following criteria: (1) a healthy comparison group is included, (2) the studies conducted whole-brain analyses, (3) all studies provided standard Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) spatial co-ordinates for the key findings, (4) patient participants had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and (5) there were at least five members in each of the participant groups. We included only those studies that reported activation foci as 3D co-ordinates in stereotactic space, examined active task constructs, and presented results for groups of participants. \n\nExcluded manuscripts consisted of the following: (1) reviews or meta-analyses, (2) those with subject overlap, and (3) other MRI modalities (e.g., structural imaging, spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional connectivity studies). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation methods and pairwise ALE meta-analysis \n  \nGingerALE software version (version 2.3.1) from the BrainMap project was used to conduct ALE meta-analysis of eligible studies ( ,  ,  ). Meta-analyses were performed using the revised ALE software (i.e., GingerALE 2.3). The key modification in the revised ALE software included the change from fixed-effects (convergence between foci) to random-effects inference (convergence between studies but not individual foci reported for the same study), as well as greater meta-analytic weighting for primary studies that involved more participants. In line with our goal of gaining insight on the whole brain\u2019s function through tasks that probe combined domains, we performed exploratory analyses using all eligible data in the HR offspring, BD patient, and TD groups in the pediatric age group. Conversely, we did not separate the analyses by the type of the task or the brain domain probed. This method also helped to harness sample size and power. Activation co-ordinates reported in the MNI space were converted to Talairach co-ordinates using the Lancaster transform (icbm2tal) in GingerALE. Our meta-analysis was conducted in Talairach space. Co-ordinates originally presented as MNI space were transformed into Talairach space using Lancaster transformation. For uniformity, Talairach co-ordinates expressed by the previous Brett transformation ( ) were converted into MNI space and re-transformed into Talairach space. The meta-analysis was performed using pairwise ALE meta-analysis. \n\nPairwise ALE meta-analyses included the following comparisons at first: greater activation in PBD versus HR, in HR versus PBD, in PBD versus TD, in TD versus PBD, in HR versus TD, and in TD versus HR. However, two pairwise ALE meta-analyses (greater activation in PBD versus HR and greater activation in TD versus HR) were not performed due to the lack of available data. The input co-ordinates were weighted to form estimates of activation likelihood for each intracerebral voxel. The activation likelihood of each voxel in standard space was then combined to form a statistic map of the ALE score at each voxel. Statistical significance of the ALE scores was determined by a permutation test controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 ( ). The statistic maps were thresholded by default at this critical value, and a recommended minimum cluster size was suggested from the cluster statistics. By using this minimum cluster size for the supra-threshold voxels, we can obtain the thresholded ALE image. Pairwise ALE analyses results were reported at   p  \u2009=\u20090.05 and were whole-brain corrected. A Talairach Daemon was used for anatomical locations for significant clusters. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe meta-analysis of all fMRI reports included 29 studies (PBD, HR, and TD). There was no overlap in patients who completed the same task across the selected studies. The primary studies included in the meta-analysis are listed in Table  . Findings are summarized in Table   and Figure  . \n  \n Primary fMRI studies of participants with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), those at high risk (HR) for PBD, and typically developing (TD): children included in meta-analysis  . \n  \n Some studies were missing age range information and showed only the mean age. Accordingly, that information could not be included within the table. Specific medications were heterogeneous when reported and at times went unreported. Hence, we were only able to comment on participants\u2019 medicated\/unmedicated status. Similarly, the mood and affect of participants were also largely unreported and, therefore, could not be included in the table  . \n    \n Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis findings for fMRI studies comparing pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) patients, participants with a high risk (HR) for PBD, and typically developing (TD) children  . \n  \n R: right, L: left  . \n    \n Results from pairwise activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis  .

No other group differences were found. In case of greater activation in the TD group relative to HR, the analysis was not performed due to the lack of a large enough sample size and of experiments showing significant results. \n\n\n### PBD and HR: Recognizing the emergence of the disorder \n  \nThe HR group showed significant greater activation of the right DLPFC, insula, and left cerebellum than PBD. No other group differences were identified. In case of greater activation in the PBD group relative to HR, the analysis was also not performed due to a small sample size and few experiments showing significant results. \n\n\n### PBD and TD: Recognizing the illness from wellness \n  \nPatients with PBD demonstrated greater activation in the subcortical regions of the right amygdala, the parahippocampal gyrus, the subgenual ACC, and the medial PFC, and in the left ventral striatum, VLPFC, and cerebellum relative to TD. The TD group showed greater activation in the right VLPFC, DLPFC, superior frontal gyrus, dorsal ACC, and striatum than patients with PBD. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe found the recently published developmental meta-analysis of bipolar disorder performed by Wegbreit et al. The researchers compared different age groups with bipolar disorder (youths and adults). PBD youths showed increased activation in the amygdala, the inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus compared to bipolar disorder adults during tasks using emotional stimuli. These findings revealed that these structures are underdeveloped and work less efficiently when compared with those of adults ( ). However, our meta-analysis was conducted using the comparison between participants of the same age (participants\u2019 mean age is less than 19\u2009years). The central findings of the meta-analyses of brain function among the PBD, HR, and TD groups, during the performance of mixed cognitive and emotional activities, illustrated a coherent pattern of group differences in line with our   a priori   hypothesis. The HR group showed a significantly greater activation in the   right DLPFC\u2013insular\u2013parietal\u2013cerebellar regions   relative to TD, and this may be a bio-signature \u2013 an earlier sign of potential PBD development. At the junction of the DLPFC and VLPFC regions, where prefrontal systems interface in voluntary modulation of cognition, emotion, and motor control, brain function was amplified in the HR group ( ,  ). Large future studies of symptomatic HR population ( ) and genetic HR population must be compared both at a symptomatic and brain functional level to look at the definitive predictability of symptoms and the correlation of brain activity patterns. \n\nA repeated and important observation of hemodynamics of the fMRI studies is the increased activity in the brain that reflects increased effort ( ). If one construes TD as the reference point of normative activity, then the HR group showed increased effort to get the same work done by deploying the right DLPFC\u2013insular\u2013parietal regions relative to TD, while in PBD, these same regions went offline relative to TD. This finding is akin to the analogy of \u201cstretching an elastic band\u201d with increased DLPFC activity (requiring a greater effort than TD) in the HR group, whereas those with PBD who had a more severe illness had reached a breaking point with decreased right VLPFC and DLPFC activity (with no effort to spare relative to TD). We could not explain the increased left VLPFC activity in PBD relative to TD. While such a finding is not unexpected in a meta-analytic study, it was largely based upon the participants of only one study ( ). However, it can be explained by bilateral disturbances in the VLPFC in PBD, albeit with the common and prominent right-sided abnormality than the left ( ,  ). In the end, while one can postulate with explanations consistent with repeatedly published findings, definitive interpretations are not possible in understanding the nature of abnormal hemodynamic activity. For example, decreased ( ) or increased ( ) activation of the striatum with failed trials cannot easily differentiate HR from PBD based on any individual study. It could be mediated by the severity of illness in case of PBD, subsyndromal symptoms in HR, type of task, or hemodynamic relationship between the striatum and the PFC control regions. \n\nWith regard to recognizing the fully formed illness, typically noted underactivity of the higher cortical regions of emotion modulation (i.e., the interfacing dyad of the right VLPFC and DLPFC in the prefrontal regions) and overactivity of the subcortical amygdala consistently reported in BD Type I participants relative to TD adolescents ( ) has also emerged as a significant finding in the current meta-analyses. The VLPFC is believed to serve the dual function of emotion ( ) and motor ( ) control via top\u2013down regulation of the amygdala ( ) and striatum ( ), respectively. The DLPFC also serves a dual function, but it is predominantly through diverse cognitive functions involving executive control, response selection, problem solving, and emotion ( ), and by being closely connected to the medial PFC, VLPFC, and the subcortical regions directly ( ) as well as indirectly ( ). The cognitive and emotion control regions in the PFC are not able to moderate the overactive subcortical regions, a consistent finding that was further underscored in our meta-analysis. In addition to the top\u2013down   affect modulation circuitry   problems, increased activity is lateralized to the left side in the evaluative medial PFC, pregenual ACC, and the striatal loop ( ); furthermore, all these regions are known to be closely connected to the amygdala ( ). This subcortical and medial PFC loop is the   affective evaluation circuit   that is overactive in PBD. These findings could explain the excessive reactivity to negative emotions reported in PBD ( ,  ) and are also in line with the concept suggested for bipolar disorder in general, including adult patients. Phillips and Swartz conceptualized bipolar disorder as multiple dysfunctions in prefrontal hippocampal\u2013amygdala, emotion processing, and emotion-regulation circuits, together with an \u201coveractive,\u201d left-sided ventral striatal-ventrolateral, and orbitofrontal cortical reward-processing circuit ( ). These results attest to the fact that, in relative terms of group comparison from fMRI studies, cognitive DLPFC and the corresponding dorsal circuitry hub that includes the parietal region and the insula are more involved in the HR population, while the wider multiple cortico (VLPFC, DLPFC, and medial PFC) and subcortical (limbic and basal ganglia) regions are implicated in PBD. \n\nPublished structural and fMRI studies of HR have not been conclusive and are limited to a comparison with the TD at times ( ,  ). Singh et al. ( ) reported that 8- to 12-year-old children with a familial risk for mania did not exhibit any statistically significant volumetric differences in the PFC, thalamus, striatum, or amygdala compared with the TD group. However, they concluded that longitudinal studies will be needed to examine whether structural changes over time may be associated with a HR for BD ( ). Bechdolf et al. ( ) reported volume reduction in emotion-processing regions (i.e., the insula and amygdala) in HR, relative to TD, that corresponded to the functional abnormality involving increased amygdala activity in HR ( ). While we found abnormal function in the insula in HR in this meta-analysis, three-way comparison did not reveal increased amygdala activity in HR. Existing studies consistently reported smaller amygdala and hippocampus ( ), larger basal ganglia ( ), and reduced PFC gray matter ( ) in PBD. Hemodynamic ( ) and resting state connectivity ( ) findings in PBD relative to TD also point to frontolimbic and frontostriatal functional disturbance in PBD. Such uniformity in multi-modal imaging findings attests to the high reliability in establishing a significant pattern of brain dysfunction specific to PBD. \n\nLimitations of this study include fewer and unequal numbers of participants in the HR group and the inclusion of studies that employed variable tasks used to probe multiple domains. However, due to the broad array of daily functions that draws from the active involvement of multiple and highly integrated networks, and the dual engagement of VLPFC, DLPFC, ACC, and the striatum in both cognitive and emotional tasks, this study was a reasonable first attempt to examine the entire brain\u2019s level of functionality from the existing data. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4217331,"text_md5":"a13ecf109ee92b9819e22994afbc7d99","field_positions":{"authors":[0,81],"journal":[82,98],"publication_year":[100,104],"title":[115,199],"keywords":[213,314],"abstract":[327,2196],"body":[2205,23612]},"batch":2,"pmid":25404919,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2014.00141","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4217331","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4217331"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4217331\">4217331<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4217331  Meta-Analyses of Developing Brain Function in High-Risk and Emerged Bipolar Disorder"}

Although these methods show good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases, behavioral assessments alone may hinder the identification of asymptomatic at-risk group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) could be an appropriate approach to produce objective neural markers to supplement behavioral assessments due to its non-invasive and task-free nature. Previous neuroimaging studies reported inconsistent resting-state abnormalities in ASD, which may be explained by small sample sizes and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects, and\/or the use of different analytical methods across studies. The current study aims to investigate the local resting-state abnormalities of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender, disease severity and methodological differences, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). MEDLINE\/PubMed databases were searched for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies on ASD published until Feb 2018. Eight experiments involving 424 subjects were included in the ALE meta-analysis. We demonstrate two ASD-related resting-state findings: local underconnectivity in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and in the right medial paracentral lobule. This study contributes to uncovering a consistent pattern of resting-state local abnormalities that may serve as potential neurobiological markers for ASD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by persistent social and communication deficits, and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. A wide range of genetic and developmentally early environmental factors play an essential role in the etiological heterogeneity in ASD . In general, the worldwide population prevalence of ASD is about 1% , with a trend of increasing prevalence of ASD across different countries . Longitudinal studies indicate that only 20% of individuals with ASD seem to obtain a good adult outcome as indicated by the quality of independent living, friendships and participation in employment . The high prevalence and poor prognosis of ASD result in an enormous cost for society and for the individual, in loss of productive years and cost of educational support . Early intervention is needed to decelerate, or even prevent, the developmental cascade that manifests in the disorder. To do so, an accurate and early diagnosis of ASD is essential. \n\nTo date, the gold standard for clinical assessment of ASD includes administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2)  and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)  that assess behavior by semi-structured play-based interviews and parent interviews, respectively. Although the combination of ADOS and ADI-R has been found to have good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases as young as 12 months old, the predictive validity of the measure can be markedly reduced if the examiner who carries out the test is not the primary diagnostician . Furthermore, this kind of behavioral assessments require well-trained examiner to carry out, yet training can be time-consuming, expensive and difficult to procure . More importantly, children comorbid with ASD and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is not uncommon, could delay ASD diagnosis due to some shared symptoms between ASD and ADHD in 2\u20133 year old. In a large population-based study, the presence of ADHD and\/or sensory processing symptoms in children with ASD delayed an autism diagnosis for around 3 years . These add to the difficulty of admitting clinical cases into the right intervention program before school age, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of behavioral therapies because the most sensitive window for neural and behavioral changes has been missed . In addition, many infants who were eventually diagnosed with ASD remained asymptomatic at 6\u20139 months old . It is difficult to use behavioral measures alone to identify at-risk group at an early life stage during which crucial developmental delays may be manifesting. The development of objective biomarkers is, therefore, essential for supplementing traditional behavioral measures for better diagnosis of ASD. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no objective biomarkers exist for diagnosing ASD. \n\nIn the past decades, researchers attempted to find out reliable biomarkers to predict ASD by understanding its etiology and pathology. For instance, de novo missense, promoter, and enhancer mutations were found in autism probands compared to the unaffected siblings in 516 idiopathic autism families. Furthermore, in the same studied cohort, oligogenic de novo mutations were enriched for expression in striatal neurons in autism probands , suggesting a complex genomic pattern in ASD. In addition, epigenetic changes through DNA methylation and trans-sulfuration were also noted in ASD cases, indicating interaction effects between environmental and genetic factors on ASD . On the other hand, there is evidence supporting the presence of proteomic biomarkers in predicting ASD such as increased glycation endproducts . Another line of research suggests that autism could be associated with the diversity of intestinal microflora. For instance, the presence of autistic symptoms was found to be associated with less diverse gut microbiomes in 20 autistic children . Functional studies are required to confirm the role of those mutated genes in ASD using animal models. More future studies in human subjects are also warranted to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these potential biomarkers in predicting ASD. \n\nThere is a growing number of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach to study the neural underpinnings of behaviors associated with ASD. In the past decades, a large number of task-based fMRI studies were conducted, and meta-analyses on these task-based fMRI studies were also available. For instance, Philip and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on task-based fMRI studies of ASD including motor, visual processing, executive function, auditory and language, basic social processing and complex social cognition tasks . They concluded that the most reliable finding was a disturbance to the function of social brain regions, whereas comparisons on other tasks were difficult due to the diversity and complexity of tasks used across studies. Such limitations together with the fact that task difficulty may preclude some children, especially infants, from participation, make task-based fMRI features not to be ideal as biomarkers for ASD . \n\nResting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising alternative to the study of large-scale organization of the typically and atypically developing brain in infants and toddlers . rs-fMRI data can be acquired in 5\u20136\u2009minutes as the participants lay in the MRI scanner with either eyes closed or fixated on a cross-hair. It helps reveal the coupling of functional brain networks independent of task performance. These advantages make it particularly suitable for examining brain maturation in pediatric and clinical populations such as ASD participants who often have a wide range of functioning levels. Numerous studies have attempted to work out local resting-state differences between subjects with ASD and typically developing (TD) age-matched controls. However, the findings have been inconsistent. For example, during resting state, Maximo and colleagues  observed local overconnectivity in posterior temporal regions, whereas Paakki and colleagues  found reduced local synchronization in superior temporal region, in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. Also, some studies observed local overconnectivity in the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes in subjects with ASD  but some other studies did not detect any local overconnectivity in subjects with ASD . Small sample sizes, phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects and\/or the use of different analytical methods across studies may have contributed to the inconsistencies. Although the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative could provide a large dataset to avoid false-negative errors, many studies that utilized ABIDE dataset adopted a cluster-wise inference approach in their statistical analyses. It has recently been suggested that the use of cluster-wise inference in parametric statistical methods may lead to inflated false-positive rates, especially when a lenient cluster-defining threshold (CDT) such as uncorrected p\u2009=\u20090.01 was used . A systematic and quantitative meta-analysis is, therefore, timely to unearth consistent local resting-state abnormalities that are truly unique to ASD regardless of all methodological differences. However, a meta-analysis of the resting-state abnormalities in subjects with ASD has yet to be performed. \n\nThe current study aims to investigate the neural abnormalities in local resting-state connectivity of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender and disease severity, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Any consistent pattern that could be identified from a diverse sampling should represent the core resting-state abnormalities that are sensitive to ASD. Findings from this ALE meta-analysis study could provide insight into the development of neural biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD in future studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwo-hundred and four ASD subjects (175 males) with mean age of 20.30\u2009\u00b1\u200910.20 and 220 TD subjects (185 males) with mean age of 19.87\u2009\u00b1\u20099.72 were included. All subjects had an IQ higher than 80 (Table\u00a0 ).   \nSubjects demographic in included studies. \n  \nAbbreviations: ADI-R, Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised; ADOS, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder; ASL, Arterial Spin Labeling; DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; fALFF, Fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations; ICA, Independent Component Analysis; ICD-10, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Edition; N.S., No significant group difference; ReHo, Regional Homogeneity; SD, Standard deviation; TD, Typical Developing Control.  Only results with corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 were included.  Only results of ReHo (27 voxels) were included.

Results of standardized ReHo without using GSR.  Results of nonstandardized ReHo without using GSR. \n  \n\nFor the ASD\u2009<\u2009TD comparison, all the three ALE analyses consistently found two significant clusters in the right medial paracentral lobule (Brodmann area, BA, 5) and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (BA 31). According to the Vogt\u2019s model , the PCC consists of the dorsal and ventral parts, which are superior and posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum, respectively. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , our dorsal PCC cluster is situated superior to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Based on the ALE output, the right medial paracentral lobule cluster was contributed by foci from three studies , and the dorsal PCC cluster was contributed by foci from two studies .   \n(  A  ) Reduced resting-state local connectivity in subjects with ASD compared to typically developing participants, including the right medial paracentral lobule and the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) cluster. (  B  ) Results of the Behavioral Analysis of the dorsal PCC cluster. The dorsal PCC cluster was found to be engaged in a sub-domain of Emotion called \u2018other\u2019 (Z-score\u2009=\u20093.411). R\u2009=\u2009Right. \n  \n\nFor the ASD\u2009>\u2009TD comparison, no significant clusters were found. For both comparisons, all results were basically the same no matter which set of Nair   et al  .\u2019s results  was included in the ALE analyses. The corresponding anatomical locations and peak ALE maxima are shown in Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 .   \nResting-state abnormalities in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. \n  \nAbbreviations: ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder; BA, Brodmann Area; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; TD, Typically Developing Control. \n  \n\nTo further examine the functional role of the right medial paracentral lobule and dorsal PCC, behavioral profiling was performed using the Behavioral Analysis plugin (v2.2) via the Mango software ( ). The behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, which has five major domains (Action, Cognition, Emotion, Interoception, and Perception) and fifty-one sub-domains of mental operations , was queried to characterize the behavioral domain specificity of the two resultant brain regions. Z-scores were calculated for all fifty-one sub-domains, and a Z-score\u2009>\u20093.0 is regarded as statistically significant. According to the behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, the dorsal PCC cluster was found to be engaged in a sub-domain of Emotion called \u2018other\u2019 (Z-score\u2009=\u20093.411) (Fig.\u00a0 ), which is defined as \u2018  any affective processes that qualify as Emotion  ,   but do not fit into any of the other Emotion sub-domains  \u2019. Alternatively, the right medial paracentral lobule was not found to be engaged in any of the domains\/sub-domains (all Z-scores\u2009<\u20093.0). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this ALE study, we observed consistently lower resting-state local connectivity in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls across eight different studies that included subjects with mixed characteristics. No ASD-related local overconnectivity was found. These results remain the same no matter which set of result from Nair   et al  .\u2019s study  was included in the ALE analyses. This indicates the stability of our results regardless of the GSR and\/or standardization step performed in one of the contributing studies. These support our aim of identifying a consistent neural pattern underlying ASD regardless of subject variations and methodological differences. \n\nCluster-level FWE correction method was applied in this ALE meta-analysis. Although cluster-wise inference may have a higher chance of inflating false-positive rates (especially when a lenient CDT was used, e.g. p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to voxel-wise inference in individual studies , voxel-wise inference remains rather conservative for both individual studies and ALE . For the sake of both sensitivity and specificity, the cluster-level FWE correction method is still regarded as the most appropriate method for statistical inference in ALE . Therefore, we used cluster-level FWE correction method with a relatively more stringent CDT (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for a better control on the false-positive rates in our current ALE study. Under such setting, we did not find any consistent ASD-related resting-state local overconnectivity. This corroborates the recent conclusion that the hypothesis of \u2018general local overconnectivity\u2019 in ASD is likely to be unproven . Such a conclusion was drawn mainly based on ReHo results, a technique which often attracts criticism on producing inconsistent regional findings due to the choices of motion correction, smoothness, GSR, and standardization . We added to this conclusion by showing that the use of ICA, fALFF or ASL, in addition to ReHo, also did not produce any consistent overconnectivity patterns for ASD. Although studies using ABIDE database tend to report various local overconnectivity effects in the frontal and temporal cortices that seemingly replicate each other, for instance, in the superior temporal cortex , and the dorsal superior frontal cortex or supplementary motor cortex , such observations could plausibly be due to the inclusion of highly similar dataset from the same ABIDE pool. Alternatively, our meta-analysis study, which included some original datasets that have not been shared to the ABIDE pool at the time of our study, showed a different outcome. Although four of the included studies reported ASD-related local overconnectivity effects, no consistent effects could be obtained in our ALE analyses. Notably, the other four included studies also failed to detect any local overconnectivity effects. Our findings suggest that the mixed patterns of overconnectivity effects seen in some previous studies are more likely to be artifacts that differ substantially across studies and cannot be meaningfully unified in meta-analyses. \n\nUnder the same methodological considerations, two consistent ASD-related local underconnectivity effects were revealed in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule. This suggests that the local underconnectivity effects are true effects that survive through the controversial preprocessing steps of analyzing resting-state data and the inclusion of ASD subjects with mixed characteristics. Being the first hub that exhibits the strongest connections of the default mode network in the developmental trajectory , the PCC is involved in many important processes such as regulation and balancing the focus of attention to internal or external thoughts , arousal and awareness , and self-referential thought . More specifically, it has recently been suggested that the ventral PCC may be responsible for internally directed cognition associated with the DMN such as planning for the future and memory retrieval, whereas the dorsal PCC may play a direct role in controlling our attentional focus by adjusting the stability of brain network over time (\u2018whole-brain metastability\u2019) . According to Leech and Sharp , a high activity in the dorsal PCC supported increased whole-brain metastability for rapid transition between different cognitive processes in a broad attentional state. In contrast, a low activity in the dorsal PCC was related to a decrease in metastability, which allowed stable cognitive processing for a specific task in a narrow attentional state . During resting state, a high dorsal PCC activity allows a broad attentional focus for the continuous flow of unconstrainted thoughts in our mind (\u2018freewheeling\u2019). This state is associated with rapid transitions between neural states, and rapid changes of activity in intrinsic connectivity networks. Our results of local underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC suggest that a narrow attentional state may exist during resting state in subjects with ASD. According to the metastability model , a narrow attentional state does not favor rapid transition between different cognitive processes. This corroborates with one of the hallmark features of ASD, that is, cognitive inflexibility . Clinically, the level of cognitive inflexibility is measured by symptom severity of repetitive behaviors , which was found to be negatively associated with the level of discriminability between task-evoked and resting brain states in children with ASD . In other words, a weak modulation of brain states may underlie cognitive inflexibility in ASD . This is in line with our finding of ASD-related resting-state underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC, which favors narrow attentional state during resting and does not support switching between brain states. Future studies should further explore whether the resting-state local connectivity of the dorsal PCC is correlated with the behavioral symptom of cognitive inflexibility in ASD, which may help explain the \u2018need for sameness\u2019 and an inability to flexibly adapt behavior in ASD. \n\nAccording to behavioral domain meta-data of the BrainMap database, the dorsal PCC cluster was found to be engaged in a sub-domain of Emotion called \u2018other\u2019, which does not fall into any of the other Emotion sub-domains (e.g. intensity of emotion, valence of emotion, positive emotion such as happiness and negative emotion such as fear, anxiety and sadness) . In other words, its activity cannot be solely attributed to the evaluations of the strength or aversiveness of an emotional stimulus, nor the two opposite ends of emotion. In fact, the \u2018Emotion: other\u2019 sub-domain is represented by several large clusters of activation spanning through the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) to anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, as well as subcortical regions such as the insula, amygdalae, thalamus and caudate (see  ). These brain regions overlap with several components of the so-called \u2018social brain\u2019, for instance, the medial PFC, PCC and amygdala, which are important for affective aspects of social processing . As the PCC is implicated in both the DMN and theory of mind network, it is believed that the PCC is crucial for supporting a common-sense understanding of social behavior to facilitate social interaction . Notably, impaired social functioning and deficits in emotional understanding are persistent features of ASD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)  and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) . A recent study showed that the delayed development in emotional understanding in ASD was associated with severity of social problems . Therefore, it is possible that our findings in the dorsal PCC may also be related to a weakened ability on interpreting social signals, especially those requiring affective processing, in people with ASD. \n\nWe also observed a lower resting-state local connectivity in the right medial paracentral lobule in subjects with ASD compared to TD controls. This abnormality was seen across adolescent  and middle-aged samples with ASD , suggesting that this abnormality could be persistent in ASD. The paracentral lobule is a continuation of the precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe and the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe towards the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The observed medial paracentral cluster in this study belongs to the portion continued from the postcentral gyrus (i.e. the somatosensory cortex) as it locates posterior to the central sulcus . This posterior portion plays a role in somatosensory processing of the lower limbs , and the parietal lobe is involved in integrating sensory and somatosensory information from different body parts . Our findings in the medial paracentral lobule may, therefore, be related to the impairment of multisensory integration which is commonly seen in ASD . On the other hand, it is believed that the paracentral lobule works with the precuneus to generate the representation of the body in the spatial world, which is important for producing a sense of self . An intact representation of the physical self appears to be important to the development of an abstract self . Impairment to the paracentral lobule and its functional connections with other regions may therefore disrupt the representation of oneself in the world that further affects the development of theory of mind in ASD . Future studies are warranted to confirm our speculations. \n\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, the sample size was relatively small in this meta-analysis, which may lead to a higher chance of committing Type I and Type II errors. When cluster level FWE correction method is applied, seventeen experiments were recommended to be included in an ALE meta-analysis to avoid results that are largely driven by one experiment . For analyses involving less than ten experiments, the likelihood that results are largely driven by a singly experiment increases, especially if the experiment has a relatively larger sample size than the remaining studies . In the current study, the findings of underconnectivity in the right medial paracentral lobule cluster and the dorsal PCC cluster were contributed by three studies  and two studies , respectively. None of these contributing studies had a substantially larger sample size than the remaining ones, suggesting the chance of having a dominant effect from a singly study is low. To further confirm the finding in the PCC, we did a narrative review from three excluded studies that examined only the DMN resting-state abnormalities in ASD. In line with our findings, two studies demonstrated hypoconnectivities in the PCC in adults (PCC coordinates in Talairach space: x\u2009=\u2009\u22125, y\u2009=\u2009\u221249, z\u2009=\u200940)  and teenagers (PCC coordinates in Talairach space: x\u2009=\u2009\u22123, y\u2009=\u2009\u221240, z\u2009=\u200913)  with ASD. The other study reported reduced resting-state functional connectivity in DMN regions including the PCC (coordinates were not provided) in children (1\u20138 years old) with ASD compared with TD controls , indicating that the abnormalities that we found might also be observed in children with ASD. To confirm our findings and explore other neural abnormalities in ASD with a greater power, another comprehensive meta-analysis of the same topic with a larger sample (e.g. twenty experiments ) shall be conducted in future when more relevant studies are available. Last, although follow-up behavioral analyses were performed for the right medial paracentral lobule cluster and the dorsal PCC cluster, the association between neural markers and behavioral symptoms in ASD cannot be deduced using this ALE method. Despite the limitations, our findings demonstrated two ASD-related resting-state local underconnectivity in the dorsal PCC and right medial paracentral lobule, which are consistent across studies with mixed subject characteristics and methodology. Findings from behavioral analyses support the role of the dorsal PCC in weakened ability on interpreting social affective signals, and we speculate that it might also link to cognitive inflexibility. The right medial paracentral finding may be associated with the altered representation of the physical self in ASD, which seems to be common across ASD subjects of different ages. Overall, this study contributes to uncovering a consistent pattern of resting-state local abnormalities in ASD, which may serve as potential neurobiological markers for ASD. Future studies should examine the specificity and sensitivity of detecting these abnormalities for early identification of people who are vulnerable to ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA comprehensive online literature search on the MEDLINE\/PubMed databases was conducted, focusing on functional neuroimaging studies on ASD. Keyword searches were conducted using the following search terms: (1) \u201cneuroimaging\u201d <OR >\u201cfMRI,\u201d (2) \u201cresting state\u201d <OR >\u201cdefault network\u201d and (3) \u201cautism spectrum disorder\u201d <OR >\u201cASD\u201d <OR >\u201cautism\u201d. These searches were confined to articles published in English up to February 2018, which yielded 278 original or review articles. We also searched through the reference list of relevant review articles for additional studies. From these research articles, we included studies that reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates of whole-brain contrast comparing ASD subjects and TD healthy controls. Two of the authors (WKWL and MKL) confirmed the inclusions of the identified studies. Studies were excluded if (1) no control group was included; (2) they were review articles; (3) only   a priori   region of interest (ROI) analysis, seed-based functional connectivity analysis or graph theory analysis was conducted; (4) independent component analysis (ICA) was performed and only the default mode network (DMN) component or another specific component was examined; (5) only task-based fMRI experiment was reported; or (6) only online fMRI datasets such as ABIDE, were used. According to the recommendation from the BrainMap team (see  ), studies that intentionally restrict their analyses to a ROI (e.g. the DMN component) that is substantially smaller than the whole brain should be excluded. Otherwise, the ALE algorithm may be biased to report the foci from the ROI studies as significant, because it assumes that each effect in the brain is approximately equally likely to occur, resulting in an increase in false positive rate. The exclusion of online dataset is to ensure that our ALE analyses will not be falsefully biased by including similar results generated from the same data source. Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, which included eight fMRI studies and 1 arterial spin labeling (ASL) study. Among the eight fMRI studies, three of them used regional homogeneity (ReHo) , one of them used fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) , and four of them used ICA . One of the studies did not find any spatial group difference , therefore, it was not included in the ALE meta-analysis. Eight studies (eight experiments) involving 424 subjects were finally included in the ALE meta-analysis (Table\u00a0 ). All of them reported reduced resting-state local connectivity in ASD compared to TD controls (eight experiments, 28 foci). Four of them found increased resting-state local connectivity in ASD compared to TD controls (4 experiments, 18 foci) (Table\u00a0 ). \n\nThe coordinate-based ALE analysis was conducted by GingerALE version 2.3.6 (The BrainMap Database,  ; San Antonio, TX, USA). Coordinates in MNI space were imported into the software. Imported foci were modeled as three-dimensional Gaussian spatial probability distributions using a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel estimated based on the corresponding experiment\u2019s sample size . The \u2018non-additive\u2019 method was used to combine these probability distributions and generate a modeled activation map . The union of the modeled activation maps of each experiment was then created to form the ALE image. The ALE image contains the combined probability distribution of finding an activation being located at that particular voxel, which is the ALE score. To better control for the false-positive rates, the ALE image was then thresholded using uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 and a cluster-level inference threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 with 5000 permutations of simulated random data based on the characteristics of the imported data . \n\nGroup differences in resting-state local connectivity among the ASD and TD participants were examined using the results of between-group contrasts (ASD\u2009<\u2009TD and ASD\u2009>\u2009TD) from individual studies. Since the study conducted by Nair and colleagues  reported three sets of results using different analysis procedures (standardized ReHo with the use of global signal regression, GSR; standardized ReHo without using GSR; nonstandardized ReHo without using GSR; see Table\u00a0 ), three separate ALE analyses were performed for each of the between-group contrast by including one of the three sets of their results each time. As to the study conducted by Maximo and colleagues , according to the authors, the results of applying GSR and not applying GSR, and the results of applying standardization and not applying standardization, were highly similar. Therefore, we did not separately test for the different sets of results of their study. As a result, a total of six ALE analyses were performed. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6405852,"text_md5":"3bbbc8b2b1261a5f2cdee6405b958946","field_positions":{"authors":[0,55],"journal":[56,63],"publication_year":[65,69],"title":[80,153],"keywords":[167,167],"abstract":[180,1715],"body":[1724,31157]},"batch":2,"pmid":30846796,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-019-40427-7","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6405852","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6405852"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6405852\">6405852<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6405852  Resting-state abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A meta-analysis"}

This study meta-analyzed the concordant structural and functional changes in foci and provide further understanding of the anatomy and biology of TN\/TNP. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nRelevant articles on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI in TN\/TNP, published before August 2018, were searched for on PubMed and Embase. Following exclusion of unsuitable studies, a meta-analysis was performed using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn total, 322 paper were identified, 11 of which could be included based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight papers, totaling 279 subjects, discussing structural changes and four papers, totaling 102 subjects, discussing functional changes were included (i.e., one paper investigated both structural and functional alterations). ALE analysis showed that in TN\/TNP, grey matter decreases are found in the thalamus, (anterior) cingulate gyrus, bilateral striatum, the superior-, middle- and transverse temporal gyrus, subcallosal gyrus, the bilateral insular cortex, the pre- and postcental gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus bilaterally and the anterior cerebellar lobe. Grey matter increases were seen in the periaqueductal grey (PAG). Increased resting state functional organization was found within the bilateral middle- and superior frontal gyri, the (posterior) cingulate cortex and the thalamus\/pulvinar. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nStructural and functional changes meta-analyzed in this paper may contribute to elucidating the central pathophysiological mechanisms involved in TN\/TNP. These results may be used as biomarkers to predict the response to medication and, ideally, in the future to offer personalized treatments. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPainful lesions of the trigeminal nerve or pain attributed to a lesion or disease of the trigeminal nerve forms one group of facial pain disorders in the International Classification of Headache Disorders III-beta (ICHD3-beta) ( ). This group is made up predominantly by 1) trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and 2) trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP). TN is defined as recurrent, electric, shock-like (neuropathic) pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Generally, a subdivision into primary or classical TN and secondary or symptomatic TN can be made. In classical TN, pain can be paroxysmal or concomitant persistent. Symptomatic TN concerns TN-like pain associated to pathology of the central nervous system (i.e.  ,   multiple sclerosis lesions or space-occupying lesions) ( ). TN is frequently misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed, leading to incidence rates ranging from 4.3 to 27 new cases per 100,000 people per year ( ;  ;  ). In 1934, Dandy already proposed that in at least 30% of the TN patients, a microvascular compression of the trigeminal nerve could be found ( ), which is now generally agreed to be the most common cause of classical TN( ). In addition, atrophy of the trigeminal root as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been described as well ( ,  ;  ). Nevertheless, in only half of the TN patients, morphological changes of the trigeminal root can be seen on MR images and in even 12% of the cases, no neurovascular conflict can be identified. Besides, in approximately 30% of the patients, neurosurgical decompression surgery does not provide long-term pain relief, indicating that the hyperexcitable state of the trigeminal nerve was not reversed ( ). TNP is defined as facial pain in the distribution(s) of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve caused by another disorder and indicative of neural damage. The primary pain is usually continuous or near-continuous and is commonly described as burning or squeezing or likened to pins and needles. On top of that, brief pain paroxysms may occur, but these are not the predominant pain type. This combination distinguishes TNP from the subtypes of TN clinically ( ). TNP can arise from different causes (i.e., post-traumatic, post-herpetic, idiopathic) and prevalences and incidences vary due to the heterogeneous aetiologies ( ;  ). As a group of diagnoses, TNP has an estimated global prevalence of 7% ( ;  ;  ). Within the diagnostic challenge of this group of disorders, MR imaging plays a less distinct role in clinical care. In research, however, TN and TNP as a group of diagnoses has been found to be accompanied by a broad variety of structural (increases or decreases in voxel-based morphometry (VBM)) and functional changes (as measured by functional MRI (fMRI)) within the central nervous system. \n\nIn the past, previous studies have been performed in which similar outcome measures (i.e., VBM and fMRI) were investigated in patients suffering from various neuropathic pain syndromes ( ;  ). However, in these large meta-analyses, various pain syndromes were merged, including allodynia, hyperalgesia, postherpetic pain, trigeminal pain, complex regional pain syndrome and fibromyalgia ( ;  ). The limitation of translating these findings to TN\/TNP is formed by the heterogeneity of the studied population, which is often the case in pain research ( ;  ). This preludes the drawing of a sound conclusion for specific pain syndromes and was exemplified by Svensson and Mai in migraine treatment efficacy ( ), although this model can be translated to improved imaging of pain syndromes, including TN\/TNP. \n\nThis study therefore performed a combined analysis of the reported structural- and functional changes in TN\/TNP patients in order to contribute to the elucidation of central pathophysiological mechanisms involved in TN\/TNP. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nLiterature was searched for until August 2018. PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed during the conduction of this systematic review ( ;  ). Pubmed, MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched in order to find eligible articles regarding structural and functional changes in TN patients as measured by MR-based VBM and fMRI. The search strategy used the following key words : \u201cChronic orofacial pain\u201d; \u201cOrofacial pain\u201d; \u201cNeuropathic orofacial pain\u201d; \u201cTrigeminal neuralgia\u201d; \u201cTrigeminal neuropathic pain\u201d; \u201cMagnetic resonance imaging\u201d; \u201cMRI\u201d; \u201cResting state functional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d; \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d; \u201cfMRI\u201d; \u201cStructural magnetic resonance imaging\u201d \u201csMRI\u201d; \u201cVoxel-based morphometry\u201d and \u201cVBM\u201d. When available, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH-) terms of the aforementioned keywords were implemented. \n\nThis meta-analysis included only papers 1) that evaluated the association of grey matter changes and TN on a case-control- or cohort-control design; 2)that contained information on the sample sizes and disease conditions; 3) that reported whole brain results of changes in stereotactic coordinates; and 4) that used thresholds for significance corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with special extent thresholds. Exclusion criteria comprised 1) non-original papers; 2) studies in which the comparison between patients with TN and healthy controls did not include changes in grey matter; 3) studies in which the field of view was confined to a restricted region of the cortex or to specified subcortical structures which was not based on previously published evidence; 4) studies in which patients suffered from neurological or psychiatric co-morbidities or another chronic pain condition; 5) articles which presented non-significant results; 6) studies in which no healthy control group was present; 7) papers in which task-based\/stimulus-based fMRI was applied; 8) papers in which the grey matter functional changes were investigated with methods other than by using oxygen level dependent imaging or functional connectivity analysis; and 10) studies with less than five TN patients. \n\nStudies in which task-based\/stimulus-based fMRI was applied were excluded as these designs are strongly influenced by compliance of the subject, the task performance of subjects ( ;  ) and, especially for TN\/TNP, the degree of allodynia and\/or the (hyper)sensitivity of patients\u2019 painful region. Instead, this systematic review only included resting-state fMRI, which is based on fluctuations of the BOLD signal, associated with the intrinsic neuronal activity of the brain while subjects are in the awake state without performing any specific task ( ;  ). In contrast to task-based\/stimulus-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI substantially reduces potential disturbing interindividual influences ( ;  ). Within this paper, we used the term functional connectivity when reporting findings from the included fMRI studies, which included both global measures and local measures of functional organization. Global measures of functional connectivity refer to the similarity of the BOLD signal across distant brain areas (such as using a seed-based approach). Local measures of functional connectivity comprised regional homogeneity (ReHo) which is a local measure reflecting the similarity of the BOLD signal in a voxel to its surrounding voxels. \n\nBased on these criteria, each article was reviewed for full-text analysis by two researchers independently (J.D., R.K., M.S., and\/or A.W.). Incongruent findings were reviewed by a third researcher (D.H.), upon which the article was included or excluded.

Any lack of clarity or disagreement was resolved through discussion. The investigators abstracted data from each study to obtain information on authors, data of publication, sample size, characteristics of the studied population (i.e., sex and age), information concerning the severity of TN\/TNP, technical information (i.e.  ,   MRI scanning system, field-strength, timing and methodology) and the main findings from each study. Furthermore, statistical thresholds used for voxel-wise inference were noted as discussion in the literature has been reported concerning the most optimal cut-off value and the possible reporting of false-positive neuroimaging findings ( ). Coordinates of regions of interest of each study were independently extracted according to the ALE method. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nGinger ALE version 2.3.6 ( ) was used to evaluate the presence of common patterns of grey matter alterations. To perform an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis, all coordinates were used on coordinates in the Talraich space. ALE is one of the most widely used algorithms for foci based meta-analysis and treats foci form neuroimging studies as spatial probability distributions centered at given coordinates rather that as single foci points. For each voxel, Ginger ALE estimates the cumulative probabilities that at least one of the included papers discussed activation for that focus. ALE-maps are subsequently obtained by computing the union of activation probabilities for each voxel. Differentiation between true convergence of foci and random clustering is controlled for by use a permutation procedure ( ;  ;  ). By using random effects within the ALE methods variable uncertainty based on the sample size was incorporated into the algorithm ( ). Such a random effects model assumes a higher than chance likelihood of consensus between different experiments, but not in relation to activation variance within each study. During an ALE analysis, each activation focus is modeled as the center of a Gaussian probability distribution, and is used to generate a modeled activation (MA) map for each study. Foci coordinates that were not expressed in Talraich coordinates were transformed into Talairach space by use of the icbm2tal function ( ). A recommended, conservative threshold of   p  <0.001 was chosen with a minimum cluster size of 100mm  in order to control for publication bias with regard to reported foci ( ). All numerical statistical data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn total, 322 paper were identified by searching the aforementioned databases. Based on title and abstract, 261 papers were excluded from the database. Based on full-text reading, papers were excluded when 1)they focused on the trigeminal nerve exclusively (  N  \u202f=\u202f3); 2) the field of view was confined to a restricted region\/brain part (  N  \u202f=\u202f6); 3) no coordinates were provided (  N  \u202f=\u202f2); 4) fMRI analysis comprised altered infra-slow frequency oscillations (  N  \u202f=\u202f3) and; 5) no control group was included in the analysis (  N  \u202f=\u202f6). An overview of the study selection process is depicted in  . In total, 11 papers were included; 8 papers focused on structural changes of grey matter structures in patients suffering from TN\/TNP and 4 papers investigated functional changes of grey matter structures in patients suffering from TN\/TNP. One paper investigated both structural and functional changes ( ). The functional changes were divided into two groups: studies investigating functional organization (functional organization refers to the similarity of the BOLD signal across distant brain areas) and studies investigating ReHO. The included papers focusing on structural changes contained 279 pain patients (106 males and 173 females; mean age of 54.6 \u00b1 standard deviation 1.7 years) and 244 healthy controls (84 males and 160 females; mean age of 52.6 \u00b1 standard deviation 1.8 years). The clinical characteristics and technical details of the included studies are presented in  ,  ,  ,  . No statistical significant differences were observed in the mean age (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.142), the number of males (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.157) or the number of females (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.157) between the group containing pain patients and group containing healthy controls. The ALE results showed that, compared with healthy controls, trigeminal neuralgia and trigeminal neuropathic pain are associated with a common core set of grey matter decreases in the thalamus, cingulated gyrus, head of the caudate nucleus bilaterally, the bilateral putamen, the superior-, middle- and transverse temporal gyrus, subcallosal gyrus, the anterior cingulated cortex, the bilateral insula, the precental gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, and the anterior cerebellar lobe. Grey matter increases were seen in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) (see   and  ). The included papers focusing on functional changes contained 102 pain patients (45 males and 57 females; mean age of 56.1 \u00b1 standard deviation 4.4 years) and 126 healthy controls (54 males and 72 females; mean age of 55.8 \u00b1 standard deviation 6.2 years). No statistical significant differences were observed in the mean age (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.497), the number of males (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.157) or the number of females (  p  \u202f=\u202f0.157) between the group containing pain patients and group containing healthy controls. Alterations in functional organization were found in the thalamus\/pulvinar (see   and  ). Increased ReHo was observed at the bilateral middle- and superior frontal gyri and the (posterior) cingulate cortex (see   and  ). Regions within the brain showing an overlap of both structural and functional alterations were 1) the middle frontal gyri; 2) the cingulate cortex; and 3) the thalamus.   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects and healthy controls of the included papers investigating grey matter volume in patients suffering from TN\/TNP \n\nCBZ: Carbamazepine; GBP: Gabapentine; HC: Healthy controls; NSAID: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PGB: Pregabalin; TCA: Tricyclic antidepressants; VPA: Valproic acid. \n  Table 1     \nTechnique details of studies investigating the structural changes in patients suffering from TN\/TNP \n\nCTA: Cortical thickness analysis; T: Tesla; TN: Trigeminal neuralgia; VBM: Voxel-based morphometry; * Study does not specify laterality. \n  Table 2     \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects and healthy controls of the included papers investigating functional changes in patients suffering from TN\/TNP \n\nCBZ: Carbamazepine; GBP: Gabapentine; HC: Healthy controls; NSAID: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PGB: Pregabalin; TCA: Tricyclic antidepressants; VPA: Valproic acid. \n  Table 3     \nTechnique details of studies investigating the functional changes in patients suffering from TN\/TNP \n\nKCC: Kendall coefficient of concordance; T: Tesla. \n  Table 4     \nALE map investigating differences in grey matter volume between patients suffering from TN\/TNP and healthy controls \n\nThis image summarizes the results of all the papers involved in this meta-analysis on grey matter volume changes.

Nevertheless, structural changes were found in more brain regions, including the PAG, the striatum, the somatosensory cortex and the insular cortex. Such discrepancies can be explained by the fact that less fMRI studies are available and could therefore be included. Furthermore, in most studies, only the areas showing significant changes in grey matter density were included as seeding masks for fMRI analyses. Furthermore, the present paper excluded several studies were excluded as these papers did not use functional connectivity derived from seed-to-brain masks (e.g., papers using altered spontaneous brain activity as an outcome ( ,  )). \n\n\n### Regions with modified grey matter density \n  \nKey areas with modified grey matter density changes in TN\/TNP which are identified by this ALE meta-analysis concern the thalamus, the striatum, the PAG, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insular cortex and the somatosensory cortex. Previous research on other pain syndromes reported similar findings. A quantitative VBM based meta-analysis showed that in neuropathic pain patients, grey matter volume (GMV) decreased in bilateral anterior insula and thalamus, right superior frontal gyrus and left postcentral gyrus. Increased GMV were reported in right medial frontal gyrus and right posterior insula ( ). In fibromyalgia pain syndrome patients, ALE meta-analysis reported structural and functional changes in the insula, amygdala, anterior\/mid cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, and lingual gyrus ( ). In addition, another ALE-study reported that migraineurs had concordant decreases in the GMV in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, the right precentral gyrus, the left middle frontal gyrus and the left cingulate gyrus. GMV decreases in right claustrum, left cingulated gyrus, right anterior cingulate, amygdala and left parahippocampal gyrus were reported to be related to estimated frequency of migraine attacks ( ). The reported key areas in the brain on pain show to overlap present findings. This has led to the concept of chronic pain as a brain disorder with structural and functional changes rather than a temporal continuum of acute pain ( ;  ). The sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, thalamus, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and PAG have been reported as brain areas which undergo reorganization when the subject is exposed to chronic pain ( ). \n\nHowever, alterations in GMV can be the reflection of different histological processes, including 1) decreased GABA\u03b1-receptor density in combination with increased amount of neuronal matter; 2) compromised neuronal integrity with concomitant extreme upregulation of the GABA\u03b1-receptor; 3) chronic state of dehydration in chronic pain patients; or 4) a reduced CBF to, from and within cortical regions ( ). The histological correlate of GMV changes in chronic neuropathic pain still remains an unanswered question in science, although more and more evidence points in the direction of alterations in the GABA\u03b1 system ( ). Improved understanding of the candidate cellular mechanisms might provide new insights which could lead to improved diagnostic tools and eventually improved treatment options. \n\n\n### Networks in the brain \n  \nThe different key regions found in this systematic review represent key nodes within the salience- (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, temporoparietal junction, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala), default- (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and amygdala) and sensorimotor network (thalamus; M1; S1) ( ;  ). This indicates that all these systems are involved in processing TN\/TNP. This neural signature of the pain network has been investigated before by various others, describing that each network has its own functionality. The salience network has been reported to show greater activation when a subject is focusing on a noxious stimulus and to show suppression when a subject is paying less attention to the stimulus itself (mind wandering). The default network is thought to form the opposite of the salience network and is suggested to be activated during mind wandering and to show less activation when focused on pain. With regard to the sensorimotor system, the somatosensory cortex and the thalamus are well-known centers in the brain that process and modulate pain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The involvement of M1 in the processing of pain, on the other hand, remains an interesting topic of research. Anatomically, it is known that every thalamic nucleus receives feedback from various layers of the primary motor cortex, suggesting that modulation of the primary motor cortex could be involved with the pathophysiology of chronic pain ( ). Furthermore, functional changes in motor cortex function have also been described extensively before (for a review, see ( )).   \nRegional differences of grey matter volume between patients suffering from TN\/TNP and healthy controls \n\nL: Left; R: Right. \n  Table 5     \nContrast analysis results for functional connectivity for patients suffering from TN\/TNP and healthy controls \n\nfMRI:: functional magnetic resonance imaging; L: Left; R: Right; ReHo: Regional homogeneity. \n  Table 6   \n\n\n### Clinical relevance \n  \nDiagnostic opportunities can arise from neuroimaging studies in TN\/TNP. It is well accepted that MR imaging already plays a role in clinical care for patients suffering from TN\/TNP. However, GMV measurements are not commonly used in regular clinical care, which is mostly due to the fact that such group analyses cannot be performed on a single subject to measure grey matter density per person. Regarding resting-state fMRI, this method has been regarded as a useful method to measure intrinsic large-scale functional brain organization in general, and, more specific, to measure the altered pain network in the brain. Resting-state fMRI involves the acquisition of fMRI data in the absence of a stimulus or task. With this data, functional brain connectivity which relates to a combination of spontaneous thought processes and ongoing neural and physiological maintenance processes can be investigated. In chronic pain, these processes include those involved in ongoing pain ( ). Moreover, variability in brain activity can provide insight into brain health, pain characteristics and brain plasticity, which can differ between patients and healthy individuals and can therefore be used in a clinical setting ( ). A challenge in resting-state fMRI is that the nature of any particular change in the pattern of resting-state connectivity associated with pain has not yet been determined. Furthermore, new insights can arise from imaging studies. Different studies reported on bilateral activation patterns on fMRI of the somatosensory system was found in both acute, experimental in healthy subjects ( ;  ;  ) and in TN\/TNP patients ( ;  ;  ;  ). These findings indicate that still part of the anatomical relay system involved in pain processing in TN\/TNP remains elusive, although histological studies aim to contribute to an improved understanding ( ). Furthermore, new treatment options can arise from the findings of MR imaging studies. For example, involvement of the motor cortex in TN\/TNP, as shown by imaging studies, can lead to a new neuromodulation target. Clinically, it is known that stimulation of M1, either invasive (i.e. epidural motor cortex stimulation ( ,  )) or non-invasive (i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation ( ;  )), can be used as a target for modulating TN\/TNP ( ) and pain in general ( ). \n\nBased on the signature of pain in the brain as investigated by use of multiple neuroimaging techniques, researchers have prompted to extract these neuroimaging findings in order to obtain an objective biomarkers of pain. However, most of the brain responses observed when pain is present have also be observed when pain is absent, for example, by non-painful auditory, tactile and visual stimuli ( ). However, the use of neuroimaging to predict response to trigeminal neuropathic pain treatment has already been described and shows to be promising ( ). \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nStrengths of this review concern the combination of both structural and functional MR imaging to elucidate TN\/TNP. However, the use of imaging techniques in pain, such diffusion weighted MRI, PET-CT (positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography) ( ;  ), MEG (magnetoencephalography) ( ) and EEG (electroencephalography) ( ;  ) were not included in this review, which forms a limitation. In an attempt to attenuate the random effect of small cohorts and thereby strengthening the results, studies with a sample size smaller than 5 patients were excluded. Another limitation of the present study can be found in the well-known limitations of voxel-wise neuroimaging studies, including a high risk of false positive results and publication bias leading to underreporting of studies reporting non-significant results. Furthermore, significant alterations in brain structure and function were included in this review, which provides stronger evidence for the listed regions. However, this could also induce an underestimation or overestimation of the alterations of brain structure and function in TN\/TNP patients. Another strength of this study was the exclusion of studies without matched healthy controls as this gives a more accurate representation of the modifications that occur due to TN\/TNP. Furthermore, using a matched healthy control group, which is prone to outliers, is still believed to prevent overestimation of the findings at the highest possible level. Another limitation concerns the inclusion of fMRI studies using functional organization and fMRI studies using ReHo as outcome measures. As these analyses measure different processes, this can confound our findings. Nevertheless, by presenting the results separately, the authors aimed to include a broad variety of functional changes in the brain of TN\/TNP patients without merging incomparable findings. Finally, a new MRI technique which can be used to study pain in vivo can be added to the armamentarium of neuroimaging: positron emission tomography\/magnetic resonance imaging (PET\/MRI). PET\/MRI shows to be capable of visualizing nerve injury in a neuropathic pain model ( ). PET\/MRI can furthermore be used to unravel the brain on pain ( ), although no PET\/MRI studies which investigated TN\/TNP were found. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nNeuroimaging studies have led to advances in the understanding of mechanisms involved in TN\/TNP and could lead to a better identification of causes and types of TN\/TNP. Key regions which undergo structural- and functional changes that came forth from the ALE analyses were the thalamus, the cingulate cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus. Clinical imaging studies should focus on these regions in their pursuit to improve diagnostic imaging in TN\/TNP. Future studies also should elucidate whether the structural- and functional changes can be reversed after effective treatment of TN\/TNP. Although the results are promising, we must recognize the difficulty and non-specificity of neuroimaging techniques in neuropathic pain patients, especially on a single-subject level. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6978224,"text_md5":"58627511a4b2a63a3530ef9bd79b9309","field_positions":{"authors":[0,111],"journal":[112,127],"publication_year":[129,133],"title":[144,301],"keywords":[315,452],"abstract":[465,2863],"body":[2872,30453]},"batch":2,"pmid":31698316,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2019.102039","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6978224","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6978224"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6978224\">6978224<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6978224  Alterations in grey matter density and functional connectivity in trigeminal neuropathic pain and trigeminal neuralgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Neuroimaging studies on the disease reported divergent results. To merge the reported neuroimaging alterations in MOH patients and explore a pathophysiological mechanism of this disorder. A meta-analytic activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis method was used. We systematically searched English and Chinese databases for both morphological and functional neuroimaging studies published before Nov 18, 2021. Reported altered brain regions and the stereotactic coordinates of their peaks were extracted and pooled by GingerALE using Gaussian probability distribution into brain maps, illustrating converged regions of alteration among studies. We identified 927 articles, of which five studies on gray matter changes, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were eventually included for ALE analysis, with 344 subjects and 54 coordinates put into GingerALE. No functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission topography (PET) studies were included for pooling. Compared with healthy controls (HCs), MOH featured increased gray matter density in midbrain, striatum, cingulate, inferior parietal cortex and cerebellum (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected), whereas decreased gray matter density in orbitofrontal cortex (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, family-wise error), frontal, insular and parietal cortices (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected). Withdrawal of analgesics led to decreased gray matter density in superior temporal gyrus, cuneus, midbrain and cerebellum (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected). This meta-analysis confirmed that medication overuse headache is associated with morphologic alteration in the reward system, the prefrontal cortex and a reversible modification in the pain network. Further functional imaging paradigms and longitudinal studies are required for a more definite conclusion and a causal mechanism. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMedication overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic headache that occurs on 15 or more days per month for over three months with overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medications for more than 10 or 15\u00a0days per month depending on overdosed medication (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society,  ). It was reported MOH patients worldwide exceeded 800 million in 2017 (James et al.,  ). As much as 4% of the worldwide population is overusing painkillers, of which about 1% suffer from overdose headache (Diener & Limmroth,  ). About 53% of chronic migraine (CM) patients repeatedly overuse analgesics (Westergaard et al.,  ). MOH can be caused by overdosing ergots, triptan, barbiturates, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. aspirin, acetaminophen, etc.), or a combination of these drugs. The harm of MOH is not restricted to persistent pain and heavy economic burden, but also the toxicity of the drug itself. Excessive ergotamine can cause sensory nerve damage, central cognitive function damage, and decreased ductility of the craniocerebral artery wall, causing psychological dysfunction (such as severe pain) (Cevoli et al.,  ). Long time exposure to triptans in animals enhanced calcitonin gene-related peptide and nitric oxide system activity, resulting in persistent allodynia (De Felice et al.,  ). \n\nThe pathogenesis of MOH, which remains elusive, involves central sensitization(Ayzenberg et al.,  ), dysfunction of the endogenous serotonin system dysfunction(Reuter et al.,  ), etc. In the past decade, multiple scholars explored with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the neuroimaging changes of MOH but obtained divergent results. Lai et al. (Lai et al.,  ) reported that MOH patients, compared with healthy controls (HCs), displayed gray matter atrophy in the rectal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus. While Mehnert et al. (Mehnert et al.,  ) discovered that MOH related gray matter atrophy located in the medial orbital gyrus, hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. However, several researchers did not find gray matter changes in MOH relative to HCs (Beckmann et al.,  ; Chanraud et al.,  ). Disparity among studies is apparent. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore a pattern of common neuroimaging change in MOH patients, with the help of a novel meta-analytic activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ), by merging the reported neuroimaging abnormalities from different studies, shedding light on a neurophysiologic mechanism of this disorder. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and selection \n  \nIn this study, we adopted the meta-analysis definition embraced by the Cochrane Collaboration and followed the   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   (PRISMA)   Statement   guidelines. A systematic search was carried out to thoroughly include all relevant studies on MOH published before Nov. 18, 2021, using all available imaging techniques, including MRI, blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-functional MRI (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), that are compatible for ALE. The query terms were as follows:   \nanalgesic overuse OR medication overuse OR medication overuse headache(MeSH term) \n  \nheadache or migraine(in title or abstract) \n  \npositron emission tomography or PET(in title or abstract) \n  \nMRI OR voxel-based OR structural OR cortical OR morphometric OR morphometry(in title or abstract) \n  \nfMRI OR functional connectivity OR functional connection OR regional homogeneity OR BOLD(in title or abstract) \n  \n\u2460AND\u2461AND(\u2462OR\u2463OR\u2464) \n  \n\nThree English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EmBase) and three Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and China Biology Medicine disc) were queried. Inclusion criteria for eligible literature are as follows: (1) original clinical studies on human; (2) participants included patients diagnosed with MOH according to International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD); (3a) voxel-, volume-based gray matter analyses with T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) data; (3b) BOLD MRI studies; (3c) PET studies; (4) parameters of neuroimaging acquisition was reported; (5) results were reported using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates; (6) studies published in Chinese or English in peer-recognized academic journals. The exclusion criteria of literature were: (1) duplicate reports of an included study; (2) conference reports; (3) studies without a comparing group; (4) single studies that cannot be pooled due to a lack of another matched study using comparable design; (5) studies yielding negative findings in which no coordinate was available. \n\nLiterature selection was performed by two neurology researchers, during which disagreement was resolved by the third researcher. Afterwards data from the included studies were extracted into spreadsheets and proofread by a group of researchers. Relevant information that was extracted included: (1) publication information (title, published journal, year of publication), (2) demographic information (number of subjects in each group, gender ratio, average age, handedness), (3) clinical information (diagnostic criteria, course of headache, time of medication overuse, types of overused medication), (4) technical information of neuroimaging (scanning techniques, scanned regions, magnetic field intensity, slice thickness), (5) analyzing methods of imaging data (spatial coordinates of vertices, types of coordinate system, methodology, software used and its version, methods for multiple comparison correction, and the diameter of Gaussian kernel). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe adopted in our statistical analysis the ALE algorithm, a novel quantitative voxel-based method that can be used to estimate consistent change of gray matter (or functional image) from an array of imaging studies which reported peaks of gray matter alteration or functional activation of statistical significance (Laird et al.,  ). ALE requires that peak foci of clusters be reported in stereotactic coordinates (in \u201cx,y,z\u201d format). All reported foci were retrieved from articles and imported into the software. ALE approach, the technique of which has been described (Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ), models each alteration focus as the center of a spherical Gaussian probability distribution. In the updated version of ALE algorithm (GingerALE 3.0.2  ) (Eickhoff et al.,  ), all reported foci (coordinates of maximum activation) for a given study are modelled as the peaks of stereotactic Gaussian probability distribution. A \u201cmodelled activation\u201d (MA) map is computed, representing a summary of the coordinates from the specific study. ALE values are then calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis by taking the union of these individual MA maps, with higher ALE value indicating more significance in a voxel. This revised analysis tests for convergence between studies (which is random-effects) rather than foci (which is fixed-effects). \n\nStatistical significance of our analysis was assessed with a   P  -threshold corrected for comparisons using the family-wise error (FWE) (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Genovese et al.,  ) which is, and an uncorrected   P   which is more liberal. The results are presented at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 with 1000 permutations FWE corrected for multiple comparisons, and an uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 set with a minimum cluster volume of 100 mm . Each thresholded ALE map produced in MNI space was overlaid using MRIcron and MRIcroGL software onto the International Consortium for Brain Mapping(ICBM)-152 template. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAltogether we identified 927 articles, among which one article was found from reference of reviews, yielding five VBM studies into ALE quantitative synthesis after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied (see Fig.\u00a0 , Tables   and  ). All six identified fMRI studies were unfortunately excluded for they used disparate and incomparable methods of neuroimages statistical processing. The only two PET studies on MOH did not enter quantitative ALE synthesis for they set different control groups. The flowchart of literature selection following PRISMA statement is shown in Fig.\u00a0 . We put into GingerALE a total of 54 coordinates of vertices reported by the five included studies, which constructed two ALE analyses.   \nLiterature selection following   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   flowchart\n \n    \nDemographic and clinical information of included studies\n \n  \n MOH   medication overuse headache;   HC   healthy control;   NSAID   non-steroidal inflammatory drug;   NA   not available \n    \nTechnical information of scanning and analyzing methods of imaging data used by included studies \n  \n MOH   Medication overuse headache;   HC   health controls;   SPM   Statistical Parametric Mapping;   FDR   false discovery rate;   FWE   family-wise error;   MR   magnetic resonance;   T1WI   T1 weighted image;   VBM   voxel-based morphometry;   FWE   family-wise error \n  \n\nFirstly, four studies on gray matter change of MOH compared with HCs were included in ALE, with 286 subjects and 50 vertices put in.

Based on our ALE study on the morphological alteration of MOH patients, it is confirmed that MOH is a secondary headache disorder closely associated with changes among multiple brain regions and networks. We observed abnormal gray matter in multiple regions including subcortical nuclei, brain stem and cerebellum. Gray matter of midbrain, cerebellum, cuneus and superior temporal gyrus decreased after detoxification, indicating some of the MOH-related gray matter increase may be reversible. The ALE method helped us in combining stereotactic coordinates of peaks of gray matter change from MOH neuroimaging studies, thus revealed that abnormal brain areas related to MOH are mainly distributed in the pain network, reward system, and the prefrontal area, as are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nIllustration of altered networks discovered by meta-analytical activation likelihood estimation on gray matter alteration in medication overuse headache patients. PFC, prefrontal cortex; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; VTA, ventral tegmental area; m\/pCC, middle\/posterior cingulate cortex \n  \n\n### Alteration in reward system \n  \nOur research showed that MOH patients have increased gray matter in the bilateral ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area (VTA) gray matter, which indicates that addiction caused by an abnormal reward system constitutes important pathogenesis of MOH. The ventral striatum contains nucleus accumbens, a pivotal dopaminergic area in the brain system related to reward processing. It receives signals from the orbitofrontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the midbrain (Haber & Knutson,  ). Research on non-human primates has identified nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex are key areas responsible for the regulation of reward. Comfortable stimuli such as food or expectation of benefit activates these brain areas, which then release dopamine. Therefore, the nucleus accumbens is also referred to as the \"pleasure center\" (Di Chiara,  ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of adults also observed that the BOLD signal in these areas changes under reward conditions (May et al.,  ). The dysfunction of the reward system is considered to play a crucial role in drug abuse and addiction, for it\u2019s been reported that the ventral striatum of patients with cocaine abuse has increased gray matter (Connolly et al.,  ). It is generally believed that drugs, which a patient relies on for reasons, can cause dopamine release from VTA by stimulating the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptors. Then dopaminergic receptors of nucleus accumbens received the signal from VTA and activates the reward system, prompting the patient to take drugs repeatedly. Structural and functional connection between VTA and nucleus accumbens was previously confirmed (Wang et al.,  ). Therefore, the alteration in the ventral striatum and VTA indicates a close connection between the reward system and MOH. Enlarged ventral striatum could work as a biomarker for MOH. Despite this potential association, more neuroimaging evidence is required, for enlarged nucleus accumbens was also found in CM patients (Planchuelo-G\u00f3mez et al.,  ). \n\nCombined with the results of other clinical studies and functional imaging studies, addiction is considered to be proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of MOH. The drug overuse behavior of MOH patients is similar to that of other substance dependence such as drugs. As was estimated that about 2\/3 of MOH patients met the diagnostic criteria for drug dependence (DSM-IV) (Radat et al.,  ). Functional MRI discovered brain dopamine system dysfunction in MOH patients relative to HCs, and it returned to normal after six months of drug withdrawal (Ferraro et al.,  ). \n\nThe important pathogenesis of substance addiction of MOH inspires us to treat MOH through behavioral intervention. This also corroborates that withdrawal of analgesics and replacement with non-addictive prophylactic medication is effective in relieving pain for most MOH, and preventing medication overuse in patients with other chronic headache who are vulnerable to drug abuse. \n\n\n### Alteration in orbital frontal gyrus \n  \nOur results suggested the presence of gray matter atrophy in prefrontal cortex in MOH patients, including orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Gray matter atrophy of the orbital gyrus passed FWE correction. Given that gray matter atrophy may indicate neural degeneration or dysfunction, this finding echoes with a previous PET study (Fumal et al.,  ) which found hypometabolism in the orbitofrontal gyrus on MOH patients relative to HCs. \n\nFirstly, apart from gray matter decrease, there was also convincing evidence based on FDG-PET behavioral and pharmacological studies (London,  ; Volkow et al.,  ) that OFC plays a vital role in drug addiction, craving, and compulsive behavior, which are associated with abnormally activated striatum-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex circuit. The abnormality of OFC affects people\u2019s expectations and desires, (Schoenbaum & Roesch,  ) while weakens decision-making capabilities, for which MOH patients are more susceptible to essentially ineffective analgesics. \n\nSecondly, OFC is believed to be associated with depression. The VBM study (Webb et al.,  ) found that the severity of depressive symptoms was related to the reduction of gray matter in areas such as OFC. Given that depression and anxiety often co-exist with MOH, we speculate that depression may be a risk factor for overuse of drugs. This may explain why amitriptyline, as an antidepressant, is recommended as a prophylactic medication for migraine. It was found that, for migraineurs who overdose analgesics, amitriptyline can reduce their dosage of analgesics and frequency of headache attacks (Hering & Steiner,  ). \n\nAbnormality OFC is widely considered characteristic of MOH (Riederer et al.,  ). Increase of gray matter volume of OFC might predict better treatment response (Lai et al.,  ). Nonetheless, further evidence is required to support such an idea. Two MRI studies (Beckmann et al.,  ; Chanraud et al.,  ) (17MOH vs 17 normal, 27MOH vs 27 normal, respectively) did not find significant gray matter differences in MOH comparing to HCs. Another PET study (Di et al.,  ) (10MOH vs 17 normal) reported no significant metabolic change in the orbitofrontal gyrus in MOH patients. Facing these divergent findings, we need to, on the one hand, pay attention to their relatively small sample sizes that were more susceptible to random errors. In this regard, future neuroimaging studies may require a larger sample size to confirm whether OFC anomalies are consistent in MOH. On the other hand, the prefrontal cortex itself, especially the orbitofrontal gyrus, is involved in a variety of neurological functions. With the help of data-driven Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling and using OFC as a seed region of interest, OFC (Zald et al.,  ) was found with extensive functional connections with multiple brain areas such as the default mode network, and participates in functions such as language, memory, and emotion. Therefore, it can be speculated that OFC alteration may present a relationship with other comorbid neuropsychological disorders. One piece of advice for future MOH-related neuroimaging studies is that subjects\u2019 comorbid neuropsychological diseases be more rigorously investigated and controlled as confounding factors, so that more affirmative findings can be obtained. \n\n\n### Alteration in pain network \n  \nOur results suggest that changes in multiple regions associate with the perception of pain. Periaqueductal gray (PAG) and trigeminal afferent area in the midbrain, thalamus and cerebellum, reported gray matter increase in MOH, whereas insula reported gray matter decrease. Notably, the second synthesis shows gray matter in midbrain and cerebellum shrank back after medication was ceased (see Table  ). \n\nPain processing is recognized as a highly complex process that involves multiple brain areas. After a person is stimulated by pain, cerebral hemodynamic changes and functional MRI activation was observed in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the insula, which were thereafter named the pain matrix (Peyron et al.,  ; Porro,  ). Midbrain PAG, another crucial region of the pain processing network, has been shown to be closely related to the downward inhibition of pain sensing (Millan,  ). The insular cortex, in which lesion can cause hyperalgesia (Starr et al.,  ), is an anatomical interface between afferent processing and cognitive modulation systems. Our study suggests that MOH is closely related to a reversible modification in pain network. There were also functional evidence supporting such finding (Grazzi et al.,  ). Nonetheless, gray matter hyperplasia in the midbrain may not be unique to MOH, since it is also present in migraine (May,  ). To better demonstrate the effect of medication overuse, further comparative studies between MOH and other primary headache disorders are in need, such as episodic migraine, which is less associated with drug abuse. \n\nMoreover, our research confirms that MOH is also closely linked to cerebellar gray matter increase, which normalized after analgesics withdrawal. Meanwhile, PET study observed increased glucose metabolism in the cerebellar vermis in MOH that also normalized after analgesic withdrawal (Fumal et al.,  ). Cerebellum is found to be involved in pain perception and cognition by neuro-anatomic studies. In animal experiment, it was found that pure C-fiber reached the cerebellum (Jie & Pei-Xi,  ). Such association between MOH and cerebellum was also supported by fMRI evidence. Compared with normal controls, there was a significantly enhanced functional connectivity between the left cerebellar hemisphere and the midbrain peri-aqueduct gray matter in MOH patient (Michels et al.,  ). Clinical study showed that patients in the recovery period of cerebellar infarction are more sensitive and severer to mechanical and thermal stimulation than normal people (Ruscheweyh et al.,  ). \n\nBesides, due to insufficient functional neuroimaging studies on MOH, ALE analysis with either fMRI or PET was not feasible, despite their significant neurological value. Nevertheless, available studies found that MOH reported functional change in the pain network comparing to HCs. Multiple functional connectivity abnormalities was found in the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus, operculum, secondary somatosensory cortex (Mehnert et al.,  ). Hypermetabolism in insula was reported (Di et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis meta-analytic ALE confirmed that MOH is associated with morphologic alteration in the reward system, the prefrontal cortex and a reversible modification in the pain network. Further functional imaging paradigms and longitudinal studies are required for a more definite conclusion and a causal mechanism. \n\n### Limitations and prospects \n  \nOur study is limited by insufficient data available. Original neuroimaging studies on MOH included are few. One reason for this is that divergence in imaging data analysis techniques shrank the number of studies that can be combined. As an example, rest-state BOLD-based fMRI alone can be analyzed by rest-state-based amplitude of low frequency fluctuation(ALFF), ReHo, whole brain independent component analysis(ICA), and region of interest(ROI)-based functional connection, functional connection density(FCD), not to mention tasks-based fMRI studies. Limited number of comparable studies weakens the power of conclusion and brings out another limitation that most results are presented with uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. Although uncorrected coordinates are supported by only one study, the pooled results may reflect a more generalized pattern after combining findings from different studies. \n\nFrom the prospective the control selection, we identified only two studies comparing detoxified headache patients with MOH. More similar studies may help distinguishing reversibility in cortical alterations. Furthermore, few studies compared CM versus MOH. CM patients are susceptible to MO, thus constituting the major type of primary headache disorder of MOH. Some of the altered brain regions, e.g. enlarged nucleus accumbens (May,  ; Planchuelo-G\u00f3mez et al.,  ) and structural alteration in orbitofrontal gyrus (Mehnert et al.,  ; Planchuelo G\u00f3mez et al.,  ), are shared by both CM and MOH. To observe the sole neural impact associated with medication overuse, more studies comparing CM with MOH is needed. \n\nNotably, overused medication could provide crucial information. The comparisons between pre- versus post-withdrawal of medications, and MOH versus chronic headaches (e.g. migraine), may also be invaluable, for they may demonstrate the effect of medication overuse specifically. Although such pooling was infeasible due to limited articles, it is critical in explaining the unique pathophysiology of MOH. In addition, overused medications were diverse and overlapping in the included studies, so we were not able to perform subgroup analysis on types of drugs. To explore respective patterns of grey matter alterations according to overused drugs may be useful in elucidating MOH pathogenesis because pharmacology of different medication, e.g. migraine-specific ergots and triptans, opioids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, may indicate pathogenesis of MOH. For example, anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody, which cannot pass blood brain barrier, proved effective on MOH (Sun-Edelstein et al.,  ), implying that peripheral trigeminal nociceptor activation is a crucial mechanism in maintaining the headache in MOH. \n\nWe also found that the sample size of most neuroimaging studies was insufficient. It\u2019s worth noting that all five included studies had sample sizes of less than 40 per group, which could bring in considerable random error and undermined the stability of the results, impairing the quality and reliability of conclusion. \n\nFurthermore, given that MOH is a chronic disease, neuroimaging paradigms may also focus on ictal periods, so as to capture neuropathological activities during headache attacks. Notably, studies published so far are mostly in case\u2013control design, which cannot prove causality. We have not identified any temporal study observing how chronic headaches develops into MOH, and how these neuroimaging changes occur. Longitudinal or cohort studies may hopefully disperse the mist clouding the pathogenesis of MOH. \n\nIn addition, acupuncture, a non-pharmaceutical treatment for chronic headaches, is worth research attention. It was reported that acupuncture could decrease the mean monthly number of moderate\/severe migraine days compared with topiramate (Yang et al.,  ). Being a prophylactic measure, acupuncture may benefit MOH patients in both medication cessation and pain relief. There have been a variety of neuroimaging studies on the effects of acupuncture on primary headaches, but not on MOH yet. \n\nIn terms of morphometrics, cortical thickness (CT) and local gyrification index (LGI) calculation are also informative gray matter morphometrics. They may supplement VBM from a surface-based prospective. One study, which compared CT and LGI of MOH brains with healthy ones, found reduced CT in the left prefrontal cortex. Also, higher LGI was observed in fusiform gyrus and right occipital pole, the latter of which predicted poor response after detoxification. \n\nRegarding the statistical methodology of ALE, given the coordinate-based data requires only the peaks of altered brain regions. The volume, shapes and sizes of the regions depicted in the original study are omitted, even though they contain valuable information. Furthermore, unlike the traditional META analysis, the ALE method is unable to incorporate negative findings (i.e. studies reporting no group-wise difference, yielding zero vertex) into the statistical analysis. Such negative reports, if included in the algorithm, may improve the comprehensiveness of our ALE results. \n\nLast but not least, the interpretation of neuroimaging findings requires more evidence. The histological implication of gray matter alteration is so far uncertain and even controversial. It was found that the reduction of brain gray matter in patients with fibromyalgia is not accompanied by damage to the structural or functional integrity of neurons (Pomares et al.,  ). The increase in gray matter can be explained by the up-regulation of GABA receptors and possible inflammatory edema, rather than neuron increase. Interpreting brain gray matter reduction as neuronal damage or synaptic loss lacked cytohistologic evidence (May,  ). Therefore, cytohistologic methods, electro-encephalogram, other modalities of MRI including magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging, are much needed for a deeper understanding into MOH. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9581858,"text_md5":"39fd1d672d27a432aef6ea7d3b12fea2","field_positions":{"authors":[0,55],"journal":[56,75],"publication_year":[77,81],"title":[92,213],"keywords":[227,290],"abstract":[303,2249],"body":[2258,31056]},"batch":2,"pmid":35143020,"doi":"10.1007\/s11682-022-00634-9","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581858","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9581858"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581858\">9581858<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9581858  Gray matter alteration in medication overuse headache: a coordinates-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis"}

Regional gray matter volume (GMV) and fMRI differences were compared over the patient groups and then a quantitative comparison was performed to find abnormalities (relative to controls) between IGD and ADHD using seed-based d mapping meta-analytic methods. \n\n Result:   The meta-analysis contained 14 IGD VBM studies (contrasts covering 333 IGDs and 335 HCs), 26 ADHD VBM studies (1,051 patients with ADHD and 887 controls), 30 IGD fMRI studies (603 patients with IGD and 564 controls), and 29 ADHD fMRI studies (878 patients with ADHD and 803 controls). Structurally, VBM analysis showed disorder-specific GMV abnormality in the putamen among IGD subjects and orbitofrontal cortex in ADHD and shared GMV in the prefrontal cortex. Functionally, fMRI analysis discovered that IGD-differentiating increased activation in the precuneus and shared abnormal activation in anterior cingulate cortex, insular, and striatum. \n\n Conclusion:   IGD and ADHD have shared and special structural and functional alterations. IGD has disorder-differentiating structural alterations in the putamen and ADHD has alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex. Disorder-differentiating fMRI activations were predominantly observed in the precuneus among IGD subjects and shared impairing function connection was in the rewards circuit (including ACC, OFC, and striatum). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInternet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by difficulties in controlling online gaming behaviors, including symptoms such as craving ( ,  ), loss of control, and excessive impulsivity ( ,  ). Previous studies have indicated that the prevalence estimates of IGD range from 0.3 to 10.8%, depending on the country and age of the population ( \u2013 ). Attention-deficiency\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has a prevalence of 5\u20137% ( ) and is typically characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity ( ). \n\nSeveral comprehensive reviews reported a strong correlation between IGD and ADHD ( ). These two disorders share some key features such as impulsivity, seeking immediate rewards, motivation deficit, and hostility ( ,  ). A single prospective study followed over 2,000 adolescents for 2 years and found that ADHD was the most significant predictor for the development of internet addiction ( ). Moreover, both IGD and ADHD have deficits in the reward circuit, which includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), striatum (containing the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus), amygdaloid nucleus, and thalamus ( \u2013 ). \n\nCurrent evidence shows that most addictive diseases exert initial reinforcing effects by activating reward circuits in the brain ( ). Weinstein ( ) has shown that individuals who are addicted to video-game playing obtain much pleasure during play because of extensive dopamine release. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the reward circuit showed hyperactivity in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate nucleus, the supplementary motor cortex (SMA), and ACC among IGD people ( ,  ). Moreover, people with IGD have abnormal structural alterations that include reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral ACC, OFC, SMA, right putamen, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex through different studies ( ,  ,  ). \n\nIn addition, Blum et al. ( ) showed that ADHD is a reward deficiency disorder, and some theories considered that reward deficiency might predispose individuals to addictive, impulsive, and compulsive behavior. An ADHD, fMRI meta-analyses displayed hypoactivation in the right and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior insular (AI), caudate nucleus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG) ( ), SMA, and ACC. Moreover, whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies found common decreased GMV in the right globus pallidus and putamen, caudate nucleus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and ACC ( \u2013 ). \n\nThe above studies showed brain structural abnormalities were observed in the cingulate, striatum, frontal, and temporal lobes between these two disorders ( ,  ). Moreover, both IGD and ADHD have abnormal whole-brain functional connectivity, such as deficits in the reward circuit ( ,  ), although they may show much heterogeneous performance. However, only one study on VBM and no task fMRI compared these two disorders directly. The VBM study ( ) showed that IGD subjects with a history of childhood ADHD symptoms had greater GMV in the angular gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and lingual gyrus than IGD subjects who did not have childhood ADHD symptoms. However, the relatively small sample size of this study is statistically limited. This study aimed to establish the most consistent disorder-differentiating, shared structural, and functional deficits, which are important for developing disorder-specific or transdiagnostic treatment. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted, comparing structural and functional abnormalities between IGD and ADHD. Furthermore, multimodal structural and functional abnormalities were performed through conducting conjunction\/disjunction analyses across VBM and fMRI studies. \n\nAccording to previous studies, we hypothesized that disorder-specific GMV abnormality would be shown in the OFC among ADHD subjects ( ) and in the putamen in IGD people, whereas we expected disorder-shared decreased GMV in the prefrontal cortex and striatum for both ( ). As for fMRI, we hypothesized that IGD-differentiating increased activation in the prefrontal regions (e.g., OFC) ( ) where ADHD patients show hypoactivation, and shared abnormal overactivation in the cingulate cortex in both disorders. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Publication Search and Study Inclusion \n  \nSystematic and comprehensive searches were performed in the PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Science Direct databases from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2020, using different combinations of the keywords \u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d or \u201cVBM\u201d or \u201cmorphometry\u201d or \u201cgray matter\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d and \u201conline-game\u201d or \u201cInternet gaming disorder\u201d or \u201cIGD\u201d or \u201cAttention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder\u201d or \u201cADHD.\u201d We identified further papers by reference tracking and consulting retrieved high-quality meta-analysis and review articles. \n\nThe included studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) they provided whole-brain pairwise voxel-based comparisons of patient groups (IGD or ADHD) relative to controls; (2) they were a task-related fMRI or VBM study; (3) they provided peak coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach spaces; (4) the diagnosis of ADHD patients had to be based on DSM-IV-TR, or DSM-5, or ICD-10 criteria, and IGD was diagnosed according to DSM-5 or YIAS or CIAS; and (5) there were no neurological or psychiatric comorbidities (such as depression, anxiety, autism, learning disorder, and epilepsy). \n\nWe excluded studies that had fewer than 10 patients, those that used only ROI analyses, duplicated patient data, or no eligible contrasts ( ,  \u2013 ). If studies did not report peak coordinates, corresponding authors were contacted for necessary details; otherwise, these studies were excluded from the meta-analysis. \n\nThe two authors (Gao and Zhang) assessed all articles and achieved 100% agreement. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe used an anisotropic effect-size version of the Seed-based d Mapping software package (AES-SDM) (version 5.15) to conduct the voxel-wise meta-analysis ( ), following MOOSE guidelines for meta-analyses of observational studies. The AES-SDM data processing procedure is briefly summarized here ( ). AES-SDM uses an anisotropic non-normalized Gaussian kernel to recreate an effect-size map and an effect-size variance map for the contrast between patients and controls from peak coordinates and effect sizes for each VBM or fMRI study. Coordinates were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space for this analysis. Following this, a mean map is created by performing a voxel-wise calculation of the random-effects mean of the study maps, weighted by sample size and variance of each study and between-study heterogeneity. In addition, full width at half maximum (FWHM) was set to 20 mm because this setting was optimal to balance sensitivity and specificity and other parameters included voxel   P   = 0.005, peak height Z = 1, and cluster extent = 10 voxels ( ). \n\nFirst, separate analyses were conducted to examine regional GMV within each patient group (IGD and ADHD) relative to controls and then between the two disorders. Second, fMRI meta-analyses were conducted to examine the neural activation abnormalities observed within and between disorders using all available data. Then a conjunction analysis across both patient groups relative to controls was further performed to examine areas of shared\/contrasting abnormalities; This conjunction method was also used within patient groups to conduct multimodal analyses, which showed regions of overlapping functional and structural abnormalities compared with controls. Some studies used multiple task contrasts, several functional tasks, or identical controls. Combined maps with reduced variance were calculated to avoid dependent data in the analyses ( ). To examine the effects of age and gender, meta-regression analyses were performed. Finally, we also conducted additional reliability analyses to assess the robustness of the findings: a jackknife sensitivity analysis, which repeated the same analysis excluding one study each time, to assess the reproducibility of the results for each meta-analysis. Moreover, an Egger's test was used to examine possible publication bias. \n\nA statistical threshold   p   < 0.005 was used for all meta-analyses ( ,  ), and a reduced threshold   p   < 0.0005 and a cluster extent 20 voxels was used in the meta-regression to control for false positives ( ). \n\n\n\n## Result \n  \n### Search Results and Sample Characteristics \n  \nA pool of 2,174 retrieved publications was searched and 41 additional records were identified through other sources. After duplicates were removed, 1,103 records were screened and 289 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The final dataset comprised 14 IGD VBM studies (contrasts covering 333 IGDs and 335 HCs), 26 ADHD VBM studies (1,051 patients with ADHD and 887 controls), 30 IGD fMRI studies (603 patients with IGD and 564 controls), and 29 ADHD fMRI studies (878 patients with ADHD and 803 controls).

In the fMRI meta-analysis, patient groups did not differ in age (  z   = \u22121.077;   P   = 0.282) but a large proportion of patients with IGD and ADHD were males (\u03c7  = 93.565;   P   = 0.001). Age and sex were consequently included as covariates in all between-group meta-analyses performed including only the adult studies, which were age and sex matched. \n\n\n### Disorder-Differentiating and Shared Brain Structure Abnormalities \n  \n#### Regional Differences in GMV \n  \n##### IGD VBM \n  \nRelative to healthy controls, IGD had reduced gray-matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), median cingulate cortex (MCC), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the supplementary motor cortex (SMA), right putamen\/striatum, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (  and  ). \n  \nMeta-analysis results for voxel-based morphometry studies in IGD and ADHD. \n  \n ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; DL, dorsolateral; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; L, Left; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; MCC, median cingulate cortex; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; MOG, middle occipital gyrus; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; R, Right; SDM, seed-based d mapping; SMA, supplementary motor area; SFG, superior frontal gyrus; STG, superior temporal gyrus  . \n    \nResults of Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) for IGD and ADHD.

Hypoactivation was observed in the right precentral gyrus (motor cortex), left STG\/insula\/OFC, right STG\/MTG, left DLPFC\/MFG (  and  ). \n\n\n#### IGD vs. ADHD fMRI \n  \nADHD was associated with disorder-specific hypoactivation relative to IGD in the L MCC, R MTG, R caudate nucleus, and L MFG ( ). \n\n\n\n### Multimodal VBM and fMRI Analyses \n  \n#### Multimodal Analysis in IGD \n  \nIn patients with IGD, decreased GMV and functional connection relative to controls overlapped in the right insular\/putamen (MNI coordinates, 36, \u22128, 4; 240 voxels) while increased GMV overlapped with increased activation in the right angular gyrus\/MOG and precuneus (MNI coordinates, 38, \u221270, 36 and 8, \u221256, 34; 456 voxels and 258 voxels, respectively). The left ACC and right IFG was decreased in volume and increased in function connection in patients with IGD relative to controls (MNI coordinates, 4, 16, 22 and 50, 24, 24; 832 and 445 voxels) ( ). \n  \nMultimodel analysis in the IGD.

The results of the Egger tests were non-significant (  P   > 0.05 for all comparisons, Bonferroni corrected), suggesting that there was no publication bias. Jack-knife reliability analyses suggested robust disorder-differentiating findings. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of our meta-analytic comparison is to show that patients with IGD and ADHD have predominantly shared and disorder-specific patterns of structural and functional abnormalities, especially in reward function. Structurally, IGD people have decreased putamen GMV and ADHD patients have lower GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex. Functionally, precuneus was reported as disorder-special activation in IGD patients. Furthermore, functional alteration in the OFC was opposite, which is activated in IGDs and hypoactive in ADHD. Moreover, disorder-specific increased GMV and functional activation were found in the precuneus among IGD patients and in the fusiform gyrus in ADHD patients through multimodal analysis. Patients with IGD and ADHD showed commonly the same direction of change in the ACC (decreased GMV and hyperactivation) and insula (decreased GMV and lower activation). In addition, striatum, expecting abnormal structure in both two disorders, was reported to be reduced in GMV and functional connectivity in the IGD group and reduced in GMV and no significant change in fMRI for the ADHD group. \n\nThe key disorder-shared abnormality in two disorders both in structure and function is the prefrontal-striatum circuit. The circuit network contains the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbital prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum, the dorsal prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus ( ). Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been conceptualized as a disorder of the prefrontal cortex for over 30 years ( ) and IGD is found to be defective in PFC through various studies ( ,  ), our results showed that parts of structural and functional alterations in ADHD and IGD patients concentrated on PFC areas. The main cortical areas in the PFC areas associated with reward are the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. \n\nAs predicted, the results of the main meta-analyses converged on the ACC, which showed functional hyperactivation and gray-matter reduction in IGDs and ADHD relative to HCs. This finding is in line with recent transdiagnostic meta-analyses that this region may serve as a common bio-marker across psychiatric disorders ( ), possibly because it modulates the neural activity of the default-mode network and executive control network ( ) and is critically involved in multiple processes including cognitive control ( ), emotional regulation ( ), and reward-relative decision-making ( ). Bonath et al. found significantly smaller ACC gray matter volume in subjects with ADHD and reduced volume in ACC was directly associated with symptoms of attentional deficits ( ). IGD participants cannot control their compulsion to play Internet games despite experiencing negative consequences due to impaired cognitive control of ACC ( ). These studies are consistent with our findings. Neural alterations in the ACC area, consistent with the interaction of the Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model, play an important role in cue-induced craving, rewards-seeking, ( ) and cognitive control in the ACC among IGD and ADHD patients. Moreover, although the direction of the alteration of the ACC is inconsistent across modalities (fMRI and VBM), previous evidence suggests that gray-matter-volume increases or reductions may not simply correspond to functional neural activation or deactivation ( ). In conclusion, fMRI and VBM may reflect the distinctive aspects of neural alterations, and the evidence converges to emphasize an important role for the ACC in IGD and ADHD. \n\nThe disorder-contrasting findings in OFC are worth discussion. Now it is commonly understood that the OFC contributes to psychotic dysfunction including impulse control and monitoring ongoing behavior and rewards-seeking behaviors ( ). Our decreased OFC activation in ADHD is consistent with a previous study that showed decreased cognitive capacity, which is related to hyperactivity and impulsivity and is associated with reduced OFC activity during reward expectation in ADHD patients ( ). Furthermore, the strong activation of OFC in IGD patients might be explained by pleasant objects and rewarding anticipation, which refers to internet games in IGD, so that IGD people are more eager to look for stimulation and rewards. \n\nAs for the striatum, which comprises the caudate nucleus and the putamen, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the olfactory tubercle, which appear in our result. When IGD or ADHD patients are exposed to cue-relative stimulation, the activation of glutamatergic projections from the ventral PFC, the ventral hippocampus, and the amygdala (and presumably medial thalamus) to striatal projections that increase DA signaling and release in the NAc and dorsal striatum will enhance reward craving and eventually result in game activity in IGD and distraction in ADHD ( ). However, we found reduced striatum GMV in the IGD and ADHD group and lower functional connectivity in the IGD group, but there was no significant change in fMRI for the ADHD group. Using all kinds of checkout, there was still no significant functional connection alteration in striatum among ADHD patients. We speculate that the reasons could include ADHD fMRI studies that claim there was inconsistent striatum action, meaning there was no result when putting these studies together to conduct meta-analyses. \n\nWe found consistent changes in the insula, which had decreased GMV and lower activity in ADHD and IGD subjects. The insula are involved in motivation, rewards, salience detection, and cognitive control ( ,  ,  ), modulated by dopaminergic activity ( ), which is typically decreased in IGD and ADHD. Therefore, the insula is hypothesized to be a neural system that increases reward drivers and weakens cognitive control ( ). In ADHD, deficient insula activation may result in reduced task-related salience detection and cognitive control, resulting in lower self-control ability and increased distractibility. IGD hypoactivation in the insula probably shows that they are habituated to gaming-related stimulation and insensitive to other conventional stimulation, which contributes to gaming addiction. \n\nWe find decreased putamen GMV in IGD people through VBM analysis. The dorsolateral putamen has been functionally linked to the sensorimotor cortices, forming the sensorimotor network. A recent research report that health controls show a significant positive correlation in the neural pathways connecting the putamen-MFG-insula when facing gaming cues, which is missing in individuals with IGD ( ). Meanwhile, this study also demonstrated increased excitatory neuromodulation in the effective connections among the insula-putamen-OFC in IGD, a neural pathway involving reward-related activity. In conclusion, the putamen is part of the reward pathway, the declination of putamen gray matter may impact its function, which is part of the reason for game addiction. \n\nIn our study, disorder-specific activation is suggested in the precuneus among IGD patients. The precuneus is associated with visual imagery, attention, and memory retrieval by participating in the visual process and integrates related memory ( ). A possible explanation is that high activation in the precuneus is relative to gaming urge, craving, and the severity of Internet addiction. This result suggests that the precuneus activates to process the gaming cue, and contributes to the cue-induced craving for online gaming. Furthermore, ADHD patients have special activation in the fusiform gyrus. The findings are consistent with a study of reward effect on brain structure and function in adults and children with ADHD ( ). The fusiform gyrus (FG), which topographically connects the striate cortex to the inferior temporal lobe, plays a pivotal role in high-level visual\/cognitive functions ( ). Speculation is that fusiform mediate various stimuli that result in it being hard for people with ADHD to focus on what they are doing. \n\n\n## Limitation \n  \nThis meta-analysis has several limitations. First, it was based primarily on peak coordinates rather than raw statistical brain maps. Besides, the heterogeneity of the methodologies among VBM studies could not be avoided, such as the differences in MRI machines, slice thickness, preprocessing protocols (traditional or optimized), and smoothing kernel size, which might have contributed to the inconsistent results ( ). Moreover, the included studies have different proportions of males and diverse statistical thresholds, which may lead to discrepant results. Previous studies suggest that neural alterations in some regions may be more severe in female IGDs and ADHDs ( ), but future studies are needed to shed more light on gender difference and conduct further research. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe comparative meta-analytic findings of this study stress the shared and distinctive brain structure and function in IGD and ADHD. Disorder-differentiating structure alterations are reported in the putamen for IGD and in the orbitofrontal cortex for ADHD subjects. Disorder-differentiating fMRI activation was predominantly observed in the precuneus among IGD subjects. The shared functional alterations focus on the frontal-striatum reward circuit, which is important for understanding the underlying pathophysiology and proves that these two disorders have a common neurological foundation. Disorder-shared neurofunctional biomarkers provide useful evidence that the drugs treat ADHD could be used on IGD. Disorder-specific neurofunctional biomarkers could ultimately aid in the development of future, disorder-differentiated behavioral, pharmacological, or neurotherapeutic treatments. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nXG and YZ designed the experiment.

However, the location of these altered brain activation patterns after chemotherapy varies considerably across studies. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantitatively synthesise this body of evidence using Activation Likelihood Estimation to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, compared to healthy controls and no chemotherapy controls. Our systematic search identified 12 studies that adopted task-related fMRI on non-central nervous system cancer patients who received chemotherapy relative to controls. All studies were included in the analyses and were grouped into four contrasts. Cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed reduced activation in the left superior parietal lobe\/precuneus (family-wise error corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05) compared to no chemotherapy controls. No significant clusters were found in three of our contrasts. The majority of studies did not support an association between altered brain activation and cognitive performance after chemotherapy. Findings point towards a possible chemotherapy-induced alteration, which could inform targeted treatment strategies. With continued work in this field using homogenous task-related protocols and cancer populations, fMRI may be used as a biomarker of cognitive deficits in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCancer is a major cause of death and illness worldwide, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10 million deaths in 2020 (Sung et al.,  ). While chemotherapy has improved cancer survival rates, it is often associated with adverse treatment-related side-effects, including cognitive deficits (Janelsins et al.,  ). Self-reported measures and computerised neuropsychological tests have identified cognitive deficits in cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy regimens, often dubbed \u201cchemobrain\u201d or \u201cchemofog\u201d (for a review, see Hutchinson et al.,  ). The most prominently affected domains in cognitive functioning include impairments in processing speed, memory and executive functions (Ahles et al.,  ; Jansen et al.,  ; Wefel et al.,  ). These symptoms are prevalent across all types of cancer, including those which manifest outside the central nervous system (CNS). Cognitive deficits can have pervasive impacts on cancer survivors\u2019 quality of life, interfering with their capacity to accomplish daily tasks (e.g., cooking and driving), as well as their interpersonal relationships and occupational performance (Boykoff et al.,  ; Henderson et al.,  ; Myers,  ). Therefore, it is important to examine the biological underpinnings of cognitive deficits following chemotherapy to inform treatment strategies. \n\nOver the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have yielded novel insights into the neural substrates of cognitive deficits in cancer patients by investigating aspects of brain function (for a review, see Sousa et al.,  ). Task-related fMRI has been utilised to detect neural abnormalities in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (CTx+) by comparing brain activation patterns during cognitive tasks with healthy controls (HC) and\/or cancer patients who received surgery or adjuvant treatments but not chemotherapy (CTx\u2212; no chemotherapy controls). Utilising this MRI technique for the first time, a case study presented in Ferguson et al. ( ) compared monozygotic twins, reporting increased frontal and parietal activation during a working memory task in a twin treated with chemotherapy compared to the healthy twin. Since this initial contribution, several cohort task-related fMRI studies have been undertaken. In one of the first group studies, Kesler et al. ( ) reported both increased activation in multiple brain regions during a memory recall task and decreased activation in the prefrontal cortex during a memory encoding task in CTx+\u2009patients relative to HC. More recent studies have observed similar findings to Ferguson et al. ( ), with increased activation found in frontal regions during working memory and episodic memory tasks in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls (McDonald et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ). Conversely, other studies have shown reduced activation in frontal and parietal regions (Correa et al.,  ; L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) and subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Vardy et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ) in CTx+\u2009patients relative to controls. Despite these notable findings, the localisation and direction of altered brain activation patterns are mixed across studies, rendering interpretation difficult. \n\nAmong popular theories, brain regions of decreased activation in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls, have been interpreted as the result of chemotherapy-induced damage (Correa et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ). Animal studies have demonstrated that non-CNS chemotherapeutic agents can have neurotoxic effects on the structure and function of normal cells in the nervous system (Briones & Woods,  ; Christie et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ). Contrarily, increased brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients compared to controls, has been suggested as a compensatory mechanism for dysfunction in task-relevant brain regions, with the recruitment of additional brain regions required to reach the same level of performance (Ferguson et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ). With the identification of consistent altered brain activation patterns in CTx+\u2009patients, present understandings may be strengthened. \n\nTo date, a number of scoping and systematic reviews have performed a   qualitative   comparison on brain activation patterns in cancer survivors across several studies, highlighting diffuse alterations in frontal and parietal regions after chemotherapy (Andryszak et al.,  ; de Ruiter & Schagen,  ; Li & Caeyenberghs,  ; Pomykala et al.,  ; Scherling & Smith,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ; Sousa et al.,  ). Aside from these reviews, only one   quantitative   study (Kesler,  ) has been published so far. In this study by Kesler ( ) a meta-analytical technique known as Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) was used to synthesise data across six fMRI studies (Conroy, McDonald, Smith, et al.,  ; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ), revealing consistently reduced activation in brain regions involved in the default mode network (e.g., the precuneus and medial frontal gyrus). However, this study was limited by not reporting the group contrasts and methodological procedures used in their ALE analysis. \n\nIn the present study, we will integrate the most-recent fMRI data to identify   robust   patterns across studies, utilising ALE. The ALE approach has successfully been employed to map neural correlates of symptoms in a wide array of neurological and psychiatric populations, including patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (Santangelo et al.,  ), traumatic brain injury (Cook et al.,  ) and major depressive disorders (Zhang et al.,  ). During fMRI, neural locations of peak activation evoked by performance on functional tasks are recorded in stereotaxic coordinates (Fuelscher et al.,  ). An ALE meta-analysis aggregates these significant activation coordinates from multiple neuroimaging studies to identify voxel-wise regions of spatial convergence (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The resulting map incorporates commonly activated neuroanatomical regions across individual studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ). In other words, ALE enables a way of determining how likely a neural location is to be involved in a symptom based on several studies (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Fuelscher et al.,  ). Overall, ALE offers a powerful method for aggregating data from neuroimaging studies as it attempts to minimise study-specific noise of small sample sizes and various experimental tasks (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). An ALE analysis will therefore provide much needed clarification into the potential neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in cancer patients after chemotherapy. \n\n### Aims and hypotheses \n  \nThe aims of the present study are twofold. The primary aim is to conduct an ALE meta-analysis to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients across several task-related fMRI studies. Specifically, we will examine whether there are differences in brain activation patterns during cognitive tasks between non-CNS CTx+\u2009patients, compared to HC and CTx\u2212\u2009patients. It is hypothesised that ALE will reveal consistent alterations in brain activation (i.e., increased activation in frontal and parietal regions and decreased activation in subcortical regions) in CTx+\u2009patients compared to control groups. Our secondary aim is to explore the association between altered brain activation and cognitive performance (i.e., using performance scores from a cognitive task performed as part of the behavioral test battery) in CTx+\u2009patients. This may inform whether regions of altered brain activation patterns are reliable biomarkers of cognitive deficits experienced by cancer survivors. Mixed results have been found in the literature with some studies reporting a positive association (i.e., decreased brain activation associated with worse cognitive task performance; de Ruiter et al.,  ) and other studies revealing no significant association (Correa et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). It is expected that reduced brain activation will be related to diminished performance on cognitive tasks in CTx+\u2009patients. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic search \n  \nA systematic search of peer-reviewed literature published up to 30 July 2020 was conducted. Embase, PsycInfo and MEDLINE Complete databases were searched. The search string involved a combination of keywords including \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201ccancer\u201d, \u201cchemotherapy\u201d and \u201ccognitive dysfunction\u201d, and their synonyms, based on a recent systematic review (Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). See Appendix 1 Table   for the full search syntax. No publication date or language limiters were applied. Reference sections of eligible studies were inspected to identify additional articles of interest. \n\nStudies were included in the analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) utilised task-related fMRI as the main neuroimaging modality; (2) participants performed a cognitive task during scanning; (3) reported coordinates of activation foci in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space; (4) reported group comparisons between cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared with healthy controls and\/or no chemotherapy controls. Studies with only restricted regions of interest (ROI) analyses were excluded to ensure that the likelihood of activation was equal across the brain (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Muller et al.,  ). Articles that investigated cancer of the brain or central nervous system (CNS) were also omitted as neurosurgery and CNS-directed chemotherapy are known to induce neurocognitive impairments or brain alterations (Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). Studies conducted in paediatric cancer populations (age\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years) and animal models were removed. Finally, conference abstracts, case studies and systematic reviews were excluded. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nWe extracted and summarised data on clinical population characteristics from each study, including the age and gender of participants, cancer type, time since treatment, chemotherapy regimens and adjuvant treatments (see Appendix 2 Table  ). The steps for neuroimaging analyses of each study are detailed in Table\u00a0 , including group contrasts, sample size, activation foci, brain template, statistical thresholding and fMRI paradigm used. Finally, data was extracted from selected studies which performed correlation analyses between regions of altered brain activation patterns and cognitive performance in the chemotherapy-treated group, including the significance of the relationship, correlation coefficients, and the involved brain regions (Table  ).   \nOverview of the studies included in the ALE analyses \n  \n Note.   CTx+\u2009= cancer patients treated with chemotherapy; CTx\u2212\u2009= no chemotherapy controls; HC\u2009=\u2009healthy controls; < = decreased brain activation; >\u2009=\u2009increased brain activation;   N  \u2009=\u2009sample size; MNI\u2009=\u2009Montreal Neurological Institute; FDR\u2009=\u2009false discovery rate; FWE\u2009=\u2009family-wise error; DLPFC\u2009=\u2009dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; N\/A\u2009=\u2009no correlation analyses conducted \n  \n\nThe parameters for an ALE analysis (i.e., sample size and activation foci) were manually imported into text files according to the type of group contrast and the direction of the contrast. Coordinates that were reported in Talairach space were transformed into MNI coordinates using the BioImage Suite tool (Lacadie et al.,  ). In studies that reported foci from two different paradigms (Correa et al.,  ; de Ruiter et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Kesler et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), the foci were included as one experiment. However, for the study of Pergolizzi et al. ( ), results were imported as two experiments to account for the different number of participants that completed each paradigm. For longitudinal studies (L\u00f3pez Zunini et al.,  ; McDonald et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ), data was extracted from the last follow-up time-point. In studies that examined two cohorts of chemotherapy-treated patients, coordinates were selected from the groups of patients who received standard-dose chemotherapy (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) and patients who reported cognitive symptoms (Vardy et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nTo examine the first research question, we conducted four independent ALE analyses using Ginger ALE\u2019s (version 2.3.6;  ) random effects algorithm (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ). The ALE technique aggregates   statistically significant   foci reported from multiple neuroimaging studies. In other words, contrasts of ALE meta-analyses only include studies that have reported coordinates of brain regions that revealed significant group differences in brain activation (i.e., significant increases or decreases in activation between CTx+\u2009patients and controls). This allows us to identify the brain regions which are most commonly implicated in cognitive symptoms in cancer patients across studies (Acar et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Figure\u00a0  depicts a step-by-step overview of the procedure. Firstly, peak coordinates reported from each neuroimaging study are individually mapped onto a standardised brain. Secondly, to account for spatial uncertainty, Gaussian kernels are applied around the foci, whereby the diameter of the kernel is determined by the study sample size (e.g., smaller studies have more spatial uncertainty and therefore we apply larger kernels; Acar et al.,  ). This process results in a series of modelled activation (MA) maps. Next, an ALE map is computed by calculating the union of these MA maps. In the final step, the ALE map is thresholded by testing the activation likelihood values at each voxel against a null distribution of random spatial associations among studies, to establish at which locations the convergence of foci is greater than can be expected by chance (Eickhoff et al.,  ).   \nOverview of the ALE meta-analysis procedure.   Note.   R\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere; L\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere. Orange, green and yellow colours indicate activation foci obtained from the different studies. Brain surface models were created using the NeuroMarvl tool ( ) \n  \n\nWe corrected for multiple comparisons utilising a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05, with 1000 permutations, following an initial cluster-forming threshold of uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. This thresholding procedure provides an appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity and is in line with recommendations from Eickhoff et al. ( ). The resulting maps were overlaid onto a standard anatomical template in MNI space using Mango ( ) to visualise two-dimensional slices and MRIcroGL ( ) to render a three-dimensional image. \n\nIn the first ALE, we tested for decreased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to healthy controls (CTx+\u2009< HC). The second ALE examined increased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy relative to healthy controls (CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC). The third ALE tested for decreased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls (CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2212). In the fourth ALE, we looked for increased brain activation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls (CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212). Finally, for contrasts that reported no significant clusters, we conducted an exploratory analysis, using an uncorrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and minimum cluster sizes of 50mm . \n\n\n### Behavioral metrics \n  \nTo investigate the second research question, correlation analyses from each study were reviewed to observe overall data trends. Next, we calculated effect sizes for main findings where information was available (i.e.,   R  \u2009=\u2009squared correlation coefficient). Following Cohen\u2019s ( ) conventions, .01 was regarded as a weak relationship, .09 a moderate relationship, and .25 a strong relationship. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nThe search of databases identified a total of 446 studies, of which 21 were assessed for eligibility at full text (see Fig.\u00a0  for the PRISMA flow diagram). We excluded four studies, which conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis (executive control subnetwork; Askren et al.,  ; Hosseini & Kesler,  ; Jung et al.,  ; multitasking subnetwork; Deprez et al.,  ). We also omitted one case study (Ferguson et al.,  ), one resting-state fMRI study (Apple et al.,  ) and one study that used a facial expression fMRI task (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). Moreover, one study was removed as we were unable to verify the brain template (Kam et al.,  ). Another study was excluded as the peak coordinates were not reported (Conroy, McDonald, Ahles, et al.,  ). This resulted in a final set of 12 task-related fMRI studies published between 2009 and 2019, included in the current study. Of these 12 studies, eight reported significant results for the CTx+\u2009< HC contrast (21 foci), three for the CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC contrast (12 foci), four for the CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (26 foci) and three for the CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (13 foci; as can be seen in Fig.  ).   \nPRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process, adapted from Moher et al.

Cancer populations investigated included breast (10, 83%), ovarian (1, 8%) and colorectal, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, leukaemia and melanoma (1, 8%) cancers. The selected studies involved cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (  N  \u2009=\u2009240), healthy controls (  N  \u2009=\u2009103) and no chemotherapy controls (  N  \u2009=\u2009134), with an average age of 53.72\u00a0years (  SD  \u2009=\u20097.7). Two studies used both a healthy control group and no chemotherapy control group. Four studies used a no chemotherapy control group and six studies used only a healthy control group. Of note, no chemotherapy controls encompassed cancer patients who had undergone surgery and, in some cases, had also received endocrine and\/or radiation therapy as part of their cancer treatment (see Appendix 2). Most cancer patients were treated with standard-dose chemotherapy regimens, which included a combination of chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, docetaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil, paclitaxel, methotrexate, and thiotepa. The time between completion of chemotherapy treatment and fMRI scan, spanned one month to 13\u00a0years. Various fMRI paradigms were utilised to evaluate brain activation including a wide array of working memory, executive function, episodic or verbal memory and attention tasks. Full clinical population characteristics and neuroimaging details are summarised in Appendix 2 Table\u00a0 \u00a0and Table  , respectively. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analyses \n  \n#### Alterations in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to healthy controls. \n  \nNo significant clusters were found between CTx+\u2009patients and HC, using an exploratory uncorrected threshold (  p  \u2009<\u2009.001). \n\n\n#### Alterations in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls \n  \nAs can be seen in Fig.\u00a0 , CTx+\u2009patients showed a pattern of decreased brain activation in the left superior parietal lobe\/precuneus (Brodmann area 7) compared to CTx\u2212\u2009patients (FWE corrected). Table\u00a0  provides the MNI coordinates of significant functional brain activation.

Five of these seven studies (71%) reported a non-significant association between functional brain alterations and cognitive performance. Only two of these seven studies revealed a statistically-significant association (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). Specifically, reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions were related to a decline in cognitive performance on executive function (  R  \u2009=\u200959%) and episodic memory (  R  \u2009=\u200962%) tasks, respectively (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). These effect sizes were calculated from de Ruiter et al. ( ) only, as limited information was provided in Stouten-Kemperman et al. ( ). Following Cohen\u2019s ( ) conventions, these associations can be regarded as strong relationships. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study set out to map the common regions of altered brain activation patterns in non-CNS cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapy. By combining coordinates of peak activation from 240 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (CTx+), 103 healthy controls (HC) and 134 no chemotherapy controls (CTx\u2212), the present ALE meta-analysis is one of the first studies to quantitatively summarise the existing fMRI data. Our findings revealed decreased activation in the left precuneus located in the superior parietal lobe in CTx+\u2009patients. No significant clusters were detected in three of our contrasts (i.e., CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2212, CTx+\u2009< HC and CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC). Furthermore, our results showed that the majority of studies did not provide evidence to suggest that altered brain activation following chemotherapy is related to performance on cognitive tasks. To this end, we will discuss a few methodological considerations for future task-related fMRI studies. \n\n### The role of the precuneus in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy \n  \nCancer patients who received chemotherapy showed reduced activation in the left precuneus, a region thought to play a pivotal role in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including episodic memory retrieval, visuospatial imagery and self-referential processing (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). This data aligns with results from a previous ALE analysis by Kesler ( ), which revealed decreased activation in the precuneus of CTx+\u2009patients. Findings are also consistent with a number of studies utilising resting-state fMRI (Chen et al.,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ), where decreased functional connectivity was observed in the left precuneus in CTx+\u2009patients compared to healthy controls. However, our finding suggests that the alteration in the left precuneus may be a chemotherapy-specific effect. This is supported by the fact that our finding was identified in the contrast with cancer patients who had not received chemotherapy as a control group, hence accounting for variables that may arise from a cancer diagnosis (e.g., anxiety and depression) and surgery (e.g., post-operative dysfunction and inflammation; Li & Caeyenberghs,  ). Cancer patients from the two studies, which reported coordinates of significant reduction in brain activation within the precuneus (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), were treated with a combination of fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapeutic drugs. Although we cannot disentangle the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this potential brain alteration, these agents have been found in animal models to permeate the blood-brain-barrier and attack neurons in the CNS through mechanisms involving increased oxidative stress, demyelination and mitochondria disruption (for a review see Lv et al.,  ). \n\nThe precuneus may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, given its high metabolic demands. The precuneus is a vastly connected hub that is part of a broader subnetwork (i.e., the default mode network; Utevsky et al.,  ). Due to its widespread connections with associated cortical and subcortical regions, the precuneus is considered functionally valuable for integrative processes (Cavanna & Trimble,  ). Recent studies leveraging functional connectomes have also found that hub regions have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections compared to other brain regions, and could therefore be considered biologically costly (Crossley et al.,  ; Gollo et al.,  ). This high metabolic cost has been revealed in a wide array of clinical populations (Klaassens et al.,  ; Raizman et al.,  ), implicating the precuneus as a region that is often vulnerable to disease and ageing processes. Due to its high metabolic demand, it is possible that the precuneus receives more exposure to chemotherapy neurotoxicity, increasing susceptibility to direct damage and\/or indirect disruptions to metabolic resources (Kesler & Blayney,  ; Mounier et al.,  ). Further, chemotherapy mechanisms may exacerbate physiological cascades that are already impacted by ageing and disease, especially given the sample from our significant result were older cancer survivors (age\u2009>\u200956\u00a0years). With these considerations in mind, we provide novel evidence of chemotherapy-induced alterations in the left precuneus which may contribute to cognitive deficits in cancer patients. \n\nInterestingly we did not find other brain regions of significant convergence across the 12 included studies. In particular, the lack of significant findings for the increased contrasts (CTx+\u2009>\u2009HC; CTx+\u2009>\u2009CTx\u2013) was against expectations. At closer inspection, only 25 foci of significant increases in brain activation in CTx+\u2009compared to controls (across 5 individual studies) in our ALE meta-analysis could be identified. The low number of foci can partially explain the non-significant findings of our meta-analysis. Similarly, our ALE meta-analysis did not reveal significant findings for the CTx+\u2009< HC contrast, possibly due to the low number of areas of significant decreases in CTx\u2009+\u2009patients compared to healthy controls (21 foci, across 8 individual studies). The ALE method combines significant activation coordinates across multiple studies to uncover which brain regions are most frequently implicated in the literature (Eickhoff et al.,  : Eickhoff et al.,  ). Moreover, the non-significant findings suggest that the brain regions, which revealed differences in activation in the individual studies, stem from widespread brain regions and therefore the meta-analysis cannot detect significant regions of convergence. \n\nIn addition, heterogeneity in the samples across the included studies may have hindered convergence in our meta-analysis (Muller et al.,  ). It has been suggested that functional brain alterations may follow a pattern which progresses over time, with increased compensatory brain activation occurring shortly after chemotherapy cessation and normalising over time, and decreased brain activation persisting over time (Koppelmans et al.,  ; Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ; Sousa et al.,  ). For example, the time between completing chemotherapy and fMRI scan varied considerably among studies. Five studies examined the acute effects of chemotherapy (i.e., < six months post-treatment) of which nearly half found increased cortical activation in CTx+\u2009patients (2 studies, 40%; Kesler et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ). Our finding of reduced activation in the precuneus in cancer patients who received chemotherapy compared to no chemotherapy controls was sourced from two studies (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ), which tested cancer survivors in the chronic stage (i.e., > 10\u00a0years post-treatment). We suggest that increased brain activation in cortical regions could not be observed due to the combined acute and chronic effects of chemotherapy examined. To this end, convergence of activation in the precuneus in the CTx+\u2009< CTx\u2013 contrast may have been found due to a number of communalities across the two studies (from the same research institutes) reporting this finding, including the use of similar inclusion\/exclusion selection criteria for cancer patients (e.g., the type of chemotherapeutic agent), the fMRI task (i.e., episodic memory) and scanning protocols (de Ruiter et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Correlation between functional brain alterations and cognition \n  \nA review of the fMRI literature demonstrated that the majority of previous studies (5\/7) did not find an association between altered brain activation patterns and cognitive performance in CTx+\u2009patients. Only two of these studies reported a significant relationship and only one study (de Ruiter et al.,  ) provided sufficient information to compute an effect size. Specifically, we found a strong correlation between altered brain activation and cognitive functioning, such that increased pathology predicts poorer performance on cognitive tasks (i.e., executive function and episodic memory) following chemotherapy. Despite the limited evidence, several functional neuroimaging studies have characterised brain function profiles as \u2018biomarkers\u2019 of cognitive functioning (e.g., Kesler et al.,  ). We suggest that these interpretations may be premature and future research examining the relationship between brain-based measures and detailed cognitive assessments is warranted. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThere are three notable limitations that impact interpretation of the current results. First is the relatively small number of task-related fMRI studies that have been published. The cluster of reduced activation in the precuneus was found from two of four studies in the CTx+\u2009<\u2009CTx\u2212\u2009contrast (Table  ). Considering Eickhoff et al. ( ) recommends around 17\u201320 studies in each dataset to obtain robust results, our ALE analyses may not hold sufficient power to detect small effects, partial out subject-specific variation and ensure that results are not led by single experiments (Muller et al.,  ). Nonetheless, our meta-analysis has combined the most fMRI data on this topic to date. To consolidate findings and clarify other neural abnormalities in CTx+\u2009patients, additional task-related fMRI studies need to be conducted to run a comprehensive meta-analysis on the same topic with a larger sample (e.g., 20 studies) in the future. \n\nThe second limitation of the present study is the variation in clinical sample characteristics across the selected fMRI studies (as can be seen in Appendix 2). First, the mix of chemotherapeutic drug combinations may have resulted in fewer robust patterns. Animal models have shown that some agents are more neurotoxic than others (Christie et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ). For example, studies included a combination of blood-brain-barrier permeable (e.g., methotrexate, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide) and impermeable chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin), which can induce mixed effects on the CNS (Carozzi et al.,  ). Second, as raised above, the variability in post-chemotherapy time intervals may facilitate divergent brain activation patterns. With the studies ranging from over one-month (Pergolizzi et al.,  ) to 13\u00a0years (Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ) after chemotherapy, it is possible that a mixture of transient compensatory mechanisms and long-term reduced brain alterations are present within this literature. The current number of available studies is too small to separate data according to the abovementioned variables. As the field progresses and more studies are published, we can pool data based on these clinical subgroups and consequently, discover further patterns of altered brain activation in CTx+\u2009patients. \n\nThe third limitation of our study is that analyses may be hampered by inconsistencies across the methodological features of the included studies (as can be seen in Table  ). First, the fMRI tasks utilised varied across studies; they comprised an assortment of executive function (i.e., Tower of London), memory (i.e., paired associates learning and levels of processing) and attention (i.e., n-back) tasks. This is a relevant issue, as tasks belonging to different neuropsychological domains activate different brain regions (Sim\u00f3 et al.,  ). Future research would benefit from employing fMRI tasks from the Human Connectome Project dataset (Barch et al.,  ), which have been well-validated and demonstrate reliable activation in function-specific regions, producing data amenable to concatenation. Second, the results of ALE meta-analyses are guided by statistically significant regions identified in previous studies in the form of stereotaxic coordinates (Eickhoff et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The probability of the activity of a voxel or cluster differing between groups is largely affected by the choice of statistical threshold applied. In our meta-analysis, 58% of studies employed low uncorrected thresholds. Studies using less stringent statistical thresholds are more likely to report findings that are significant than studies with stricter thresholds (Acar et al.,  ). This undoubtedly explains some of the variability observed in the literature on functional brain alterations in cancer patients. While ALE is able to remove some between-study variability (i.e., sample size), the fact that the analysis exclusively combines data for statistically significant sites only, suggests it may introduce bias (Acar et al.,  ). Future researchers should take this bias into account by applying cluster-level family-wise error correction (  p  \u2009<\u2009.05), as this thresholding procedure has low susceptibility to false positives (Muller et al.,  ). \n\nDespite these limitations, patterns of abnormal brain activation are emerging from task-related fMRI findings on cancer survivors. A strength of the current study lies in the ALE approach used to collate data across diverse neuroimaging studies to clarify known inconsistencies (Sousa et al.,  ). We also performed the most up-to-date literature search of task-related fMRI data on cognitive deficits in cancer patients. For example, compared to a previous ALE analysis (Kesler,  ), we included six additional studies that were not previously incorporated (Correa et al.,  ; Menning et al.,  ; Pergolizzi et al.,  ; Stouten-Kemperman et al.,  ; Vardy et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present ALE meta-analysis is one of the first to combine a series of recent task-related fMRI studies to identify reliable regions of altered brain activation patterns in CTx+\u2009patients. After accounting for cancer-related variables, we found a pattern of reduced activation in the left precuneus of CTx+\u2009patients. Our results provide insight into a possible chemotherapy-induced alteration in cancer survivors, potentially guiding targeted treatment strategies. Further studies are needed to perform a larger-scale meta-analysis using harmonised task-related fMRI protocols, evaluating the effects of chemotherapeutic agents and post-chemotherapy time intervals on brain activation patterns. With continued investigation, fMRI may be considered a useful biomarker of cognitive deficits in the future. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9581855,"text_md5":"262f8727bdc1d8e3b44584d617444df8","field_positions":{"authors":[0,92],"journal":[93,112],"publication_year":[114,118],"title":[129,273],"keywords":[287,374],"abstract":[387,1885],"body":[1894,38446]},"batch":2,"pmid":35366180,"doi":"10.1007\/s11682-022-00655-4","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581855","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9581855"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9581855\">9581855<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9581855  Mapping cognitive deficits in cancer patients after chemotherapy: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of task-related fMRI studies"}

To this aim, we conducted a neuroimaging   meta  -analysis to compare the brain activity during social perception in patients with PD versus healthy controls. Our results show that PD patients exhibit a significantly decreased response in the basal ganglia (putamen and pallidum) and a trend toward decreased activity in the mirror system, particularly in the left parietal cortex (inferior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus). This reduced activation may be tied to a disruption of cognitive resonance mechanisms and may thus constitute the basis of impaired others\u2019 representations underlying action and emotion perception. We also found increased activation in the posterior cerebellum in PD, although only in a within-group analysis and not in comparison with healthy controls. This cerebellar activation may reflect compensatory mechanisms, an aspect that deserves further investigation. We discuss the clinical implications of our findings for the development of novel social skill training programs for PD patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.,  ). It is usually associated with manifest motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia and akinesia, but neurocognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders can also be observed (for recent reviews, see  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Within the neurocognitive sphere, PD can be characterized by disorders of social cognition (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Social perception is one of the main social abilities affected in patients with PD ( ), particularly for what concerns action observation ( ), face perception ( ), and emotion recognition ( ). These social anomalies may lead to a wide range of negative outcomes, such as loneliness, stigma, and dehumanization, which might impair the patient\u2019s life more than other symptoms ( ). Despite this evidence, the neural substrates of social perception deficits in PD remain to be clarified ( ). \n\nPD is characterized by neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia, particularly the dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra ( ). Although social deficits in PD have been related to dopamine depletion in these nuclei ( ), particularly in the putamen ( ), alterations in the functioning of other brain regions may contribute to the impairment. Among these, the cerebellum \u2013 which is known to be involved in cognitive processing beyond motor control ( ,  ) - may play a critical role ( ). Indeed, abnormal cerebellum activity has been observed in PD patients during both cognitive (e.g.,  ,  ,  ) and social perception (e.g.,  ) tasks, as well as during rest conditions (e.g.,  ). Moreover, PD patients may show a hyper-metabolism in the cerebellum, possibly as a compensatory effort ( ): it is likely that the increased activity or connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop compensate the hypofunction in the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit to maintain function at a near normal level ( ,  ). Indeed, the results of several studies suggest that the cerebellar hyperactivation allows patients with PD to execute motor tasks at the same level as healthy controls (e.g.,  ). Moreover, machine-learning classification has shown that morphological alterations in the cerebellum are predictive of PD ( ). Importantly, however, the association between cerebellar activity and motor symptoms of PD is complex: in stark contrast to the compensatory mechanism hypothesis, changes in cerebellum activation have been associated with motor dysfunction of PD, such as resting tremor ( ), bradykinesia, and dyskinesias ( ). \n\nIn addition to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, other regions seem to be associated with social perception alterations in PD.   reported that emotion recognition in PD patients was associated with decreased responses in mirror neuron areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the supplementary motor cortex compared to healthy controls, possibly reflecting a disruption of neural resonance and thus be the basis of impaired emotion recognition in PD. In turn, other studies reported a somehow opposite pattern showing increased activation in somatosensory cortices (parietal lobe) during emotion recognition, this enhanced activation likely functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced striatal activation ( ). Furthermore, other studies reported a sub-cortical dysfunction during social perception processes in PD, particularly in the amygdala ( ). Neuroimaging results, however, have been overall inconsistent across studies ( ). \n\nMeta-analyses integrate experimental findings stemming from separate experiments into a unifying statistical model, thus highlighting the consistency of neural patterns shared by such experiments ( ). Although a recent   meta  -analysis by   addressed the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and motor functions in PD, a neuroimaging   meta  -analysis for social processing in PD has not been carried out so far. Here, we implemented a coordinate-based   meta  -analysis on this topic, to clarify: (a) the neural bases of social perception processing in patients with PD and (b) the differences in social perception-related brain activation between patients with PD and healthy control (HC) participants. Specifically, we aimed to highlight the convergence across multiple experiments on social perception processes in patients with PD. Based on the literature, we expected to find in PD patients compared to healthy controls: a) a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia (see  ) and possibly b) evidence of increased activity in the cerebellum during processing of social information, which, as highlighted above, may be indicative of either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ), or motor dysfunction ( ). Regarding effects in the parietal cortex, we do not have specific hypotheses, considering that opposite results have been reported (see   for compensatory mechanisms, and   for defective mechanisms). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Rationale of the   meta  -analytic approach \n  \nWe used a set of ALE   meta  -analyses to investigate the neural basis of impaired social perception in PD patients and their specificity with respect to healthy control individuals. Meta-analyses can overcome the limitations that individual neuroimaging experiments suffer from ( ). To carry out the   meta  -analysis for this study, we resorted to ALE, a statistical approach that capitalizes on Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates to integrate previously published experimental results ( ). Using ALE, we carried out two different analyses: one on PD patients\u2019 data, and one on HC participants\u2019 data. After that, we contrasted the respective   meta  -analyses between the two groups. Our goal was to identify the group-specific brain activations underlying social perception, irrespective of experimental materials (i.e., verbal or pictorial stimuli) and employed tasks (e.g., implicit or explicit; action observation or evaluation tasks; etc.). \n\nBy taking into account the variety of experimental procedures (i.e. materials and tasks) that have been used in studies on social perception, and by aggregating such variety   meta  -analytically, we can more confidently ensure the generalizability of our results beyond specific methodological choices ( ). The criteria for including studies in our   meta  -analysis were defined by M.A., and then verified by the other authors. This multiple verification by independent investigators can minimize the selection bias ( ). \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nOur literature selection started by searching on Pubmed ( ) for the following keyword strings: \u201csocial cognition Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial cognition Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201ctheory of mind Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cempathy Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cemotion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cface Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbody Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201csocial perception Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cbiological motion Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201cpoint light display Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d, \u201caction observation Parkinson PET\u201d, \u201cfacial Parkinson   f  MRI\u201d and \u201cfacial Parkinson PET\u201d.

Empirical studies using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (  f  MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), excluding studies using other neuroimaging techniques (i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)) with different spatial and temporal resolution. \n\n3. Studies based on whole-brain images and analyses, thus excluding reports of neuroanatomically more restricted analyses produced by the application of regions of interest (ROIs) or small volume correction (SVC) ( ). \n\n4. Studies on individuals diagnosed with PD, in which the presence and the severity of the impairment was assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) ( ). We decided to include this selection criteria as a check for the clinical evaluation of PD, given that UPDRS is the most well-established scale for assessing disability and impairment of PD ( ). Importantly, no studies were excluded for not fulfilling this criterion. \n\n5. Studies reporting the results of within-group comparisons, between-group comparisons, or both. More specifically, we selected coordinates from: (i) within-group simple effects, or\/and (ii) between-group comparisons (i.e., PD vs. HC). We included the within-group data into the analyses to get a better overview on whether a specific brain area was more strongly associated with one group than the other, while still showing activation in both groups, or else whether the same brain area was exclusively activated in just one group (e.g.,  ). By including coordinates from different types of contrasts (i.e., both between and within), we tried to maximize the number of included papers with a specific focus on social perception in each group. \n\n6. Functional neuroimaging studies focused on social perception. More specifically, we ascertained to only include studies that reported statistical contrasts specifically targeting: \n\na) Human face and human action perception, involving the representation of other individuals. Therefore, we retained only tasks requiring participants to process stimuli eliciting a representation of others\u2019 actions and contrasting this with control conditions without human representation ( ), as well as tasks comparing the perception of faces versus non-meaningful mosaic-like colored patterns ( ). \n\nb) Direct comparisons between emotional stimuli and control stimuli (emotion\u00a0>\u00a0neutral in others;  ). We included paradigms in which participants attended to emotional stimuli (e.g., faces expressing positive and\/or negative emotions) aimed to elicit emotional processing (either explicit or implicit), and contrasting this kind of emotional representation with control conditions in which there was no emotional characterization (e.g., neutral faces;  ). \n\nc) Positive correlations between brain activity and performance in social tasks (e.g., emotional facial recognition (EFR) task;  ) or in neuropsychological tests assessing aspects related to social deficits (e.g., depression;  ). \n\nWe excluded 760 irrelevant articles based on titles and abstracts. Closer full-text inspection of the remaining 110 articles according to the above selection criteria lead to the further exclusion of studies that did not employ   f  MRI or PET techniques (8 studies); review articles (4 studies); studies adopting either ROIs or SVC for statistical analyses (13 studies); studies not focusing on either PD patients (6 studies) or social perception (57 studies); studies not reporting essential information, such as x\/y\/z coordinates (8 studies). Fourteen studies in total fulfilled the above specified criteria. \n\nWe sought to increment the number of compatible studies by closely inspecting studies that did not enter our first-pass literature search but either quoted, or were quoted by, the 14 selected studies. We also closely inspected recent review articles and   meta  -analyses focused on cognitive processes in PD patients ( ,  ). This second-pass search yielded 13 additional studies matching our inclusion criteria, thus increasing the total number of selected studies to 27 ( ). Of these 27 previously published studies, 25 studies reported activation foci for PD patients and could thus be included in the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on PD patients ( ). These 25 studies provided 25 independent experiments (i.e. individual comparisons reported) with overall 455 PD subjects and 204 foci. In turn, 18 studies reported activation foci for healthy control individuals, and could enter the within-group ALE   meta  -analysis on healthy controls. These 18 studies provided 18 independent experiments, with overall 317 HC subjects and 196 foci ( ). The number of studies entering the two   meta  -analyses satisfied methodological recommendations on the ALE method ( ,  ), particularly ensuring that results would not disproportionally represent just a few experiments (see also  ).   \nOverview of the 27 studies included in the   meta  -analysis on the neural bases of social perception in both patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). \n    \n\nAnother important methodological caveat is that the presence of more than one experiment including the same participants can undermine the validity of the   meta  -analytic results. To cope with this problem, we pooled the coordinates from all the relevant contrasts of a study as if they derived from just one experiment, thus effectively adjusting for within-group effects ( ). This issue concerned 14 out of 27 studies. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe used the GingerALE software 3.0.2 ( ) to conduct a set of ALE analyses aiming at the identification of the brain areas associated with social perception in either PD patients, HC, or both groups. We followed the method described by  , resulting in the same procedure reported in  . In a first step, each of the activation coordinates derived from the selected studies, keeping separate those related to PD patients from the HC ones, was taken as the centre of a three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution capturing the spatial uncertainty intrinsically associated with the coordinate data. All coordinates gathered from the selected studies that were not already in the MNI space were manually converted from the Tailairach to the MNI space by using the transformation tool supplied with GingerALE ( ). The set of activation coordinates of each experiment was used to calculate probability distributions in the image space, which was then fitted in every voxel to yield a modeled activation (MA) map. The combination of the MA maps produced the ALE scores representing the convergence across experiments of activation in each brain voxel ( ). In order to provide reliable statistical estimates (i.e. \u201ctrue\u201d convergence as opposed to random convergence), the ALE scores were contrasted against an empirically defined null distribution ( ). The null distribution is generated by random spatial association between experiments, with the distribution of foci within any given experiment maintained fixed. To this aim, a voxel was sampled at random from each MA map, and the union of the obtained values was calculated. This permutation was iterated 1,000 times and at each iteration the obtained ALE score was retained, yielding a densely sampled ALE null distribution. The comparison between the \u201ctrue\u201d and the null distribution effectively instantiates random-effects statistics, which represent the above-chance convergence across experiments, mitigating the possible preponderance of coordinate clustering in just one or in a small subset of experiments. To correct for multiple comparisons across voxels and protect against false positive errors, we adopted a p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations ( ). \n\nIn a second analytical step, the significance maps that were separately obtained from, respectively, the PD and HC studies, were used to calculate direct comparisons between PD patients and HC, and the conjunction analyses across the two groups, to unveil, respectively, specific and common   meta  -analytic activation effects. This is accomplished by first generating a conjunction image, namely the voxel-wise minimum value across the ALE images for PD and HC, representing common brain activations in the two groups ( ). Subsequently, two ALE contrasts images were generated by directly subtracting one ALE image from the other. To correct for study size, GingerALE implements a random permutation of coordinates in two groups of the same size as the original datasets. A null distribution was generated by iterating a random permutation 1,000 times, each time subtracting the ALE images of the two simulated groups. The \u201ctrue data\u201d were then compared to the null distribution at every voxel. The ALE subtraction scores were converted to Z scores. For the between-group comparisons, given the unavailability of family wise error type corrected cluster-level inference in the GingerALE software ( ), we adopted a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold (as in previous publications, see for example,  ,  ,  ,  ) and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. For exploratory purposes, in order to also reveal possible increased or decreased   meta  -analytic activation effects showing a trend towards statistical significance, we also run the within-group analyses adopting a slightly less conservative statistical threshold of\u00a0<\u00a00.1 cluster-level threshold with family wise error type correction, with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 cluster-forming threshold and 1,000 permutations. This less conservative threshold then also constituted the input for the between-group comparisons for which, as previously noted, family wise error type correction is unavailable in GingerALE, and where we therefore again used a conventional uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 threshold and a minimum cluster volume size of 100\u00a0mm  with 1,000 permutations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Social perception in patients with Parkinson disease \n  \nSocial perception processes in PD patients recruited consistent activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, alongside the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI) (  a;  ).

In turn, only a few studies have focused on the neural correlates of social perception deficits in PD patients, with rather inconsistent results. Here, we used a coordinate-based neuroimaging   meta  -analysis procedure to highlight the consistency in the available findings. This is the first neuroimaging   meta  -analysis that aimed to clarify the neural bases of social perception impairments in PD patients. We expected to find a decreased activation in the frontal cortex and in the basal ganglia and possibly an increased activity in the cerebellum in PD patients, compared to HC participants. \n\n### Social perception in PD patients \n  \nOur results show that during social perception tasks PD patients reveal consistent activations in a bilateral network involving the middle and inferior occipital gyri and the fusiform gyrus, as well as the right middle temporal gyrus and the right posterior cerebellum (lobule VI). \n\nBrain responses elicited by social perception tasks have been previously found in the temporal and fusiform cortex of PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ), in agreement with our results. It is well known that the fusiform gyrus plays a fundamental role in face processing ( ,  ,  ). Other regions in the middle and superior temporal sulcus are crucially involved in social perception, and particularly in the perception of biological motion involving body parts such as faces, hands, and postures of conspecifics ( ,  ,  ). \n\nOur data are also consistent with increasing evidence showing the involvement of the posterior (lateral) cerebellum in social perception tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), as suggested also by connectivity studies showing bidirectional closed loops between the posterior cerebellar lobe and the mentalizing network ( ). In particular, we found a specific activation in the lobule VI. Lobule VI to Lobule IX represent the posterior cerebellar lobe, which is separated by the primary fissure from the anterior lobe (lobules I-V) and by the posterolateral fissure from the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X). The posterior lobe (particularly lobules VI and VII) has been associated with language, spatial, executive, working memory, and social-affective tasks ( ), rather than motor tasks ( ). The role of the cerebellum in social prediction and social perception in healthy participants has been recently supported by noninvasive brain stimulation (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and neuroimaging data (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nA general role of the posterior cerebellum in social cognition has been assumed in relation to supporting optimal predictions about social interactions ( ). In the motor domain, motor sequence predictions are created by the cerebellum and are then compared with feedback signals from external inputs. In this way, online adjusting of motor action execution becomes possible ( ). It is nowadays acknowledged that the cerebellum constructs internal models also for purely mental states, without movements or somatosensory feedback ( ,  ,  ). In this view, the posterior cerebellum may be involved in the processing of social stimuli by providing internal models of social interactions, thus allowing predicting\/anticipating others\u2019 behaviors in the social environment ( ,  ,  ). Recently, also data from neuropsychological studies in children with congenital ( ) and acquired ( ) cerebellar damage supported the role of the cerebellum in social prediction. Nevertheless, as discussed in the Introduction, the exact nature of increased cerebellar activation in PD remains elusive, with contrasting interpretations favoring either beneficial compensatory mechanisms ( ) or motor dysfunction ( ). \n\n\n### Social perception in healthy controls \n  \nDuring social perception tasks, HC subjects displayed consistent activation in left basal ganglia. \n\nIn addition to their motor function, the basal ganglia also subserve cognitive functions ( ,  ,  ). Previous studies have pointed to a critical role of basal ganglia in social cognition processes such as emotion regulation and recognition as well as reward processing ( ,  ; for review see  ,  ). The basal ganglia, through the selection of relevant and the filtering of irrelevant emotional stimuli ( ), promote quick and appropriate behavioral responses ( ). The continuous repetition of these selection process (relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli) leads to a reinforcement of neural emotional responses, which may become largely automatic ( ). \n\n\n### Commonalities and differences between PD patients and HC during social perception tasks \n  \nWe found greater activation in healthy subjects compared to PD patients in the left basal ganglia. In turn, patients with PD had no greater activation than controls. Also, we did not find any common significant activation between patients with PD and healthy control individuals during social processing in brain areas related to recognition of social signals. However, this latter finding likely depends on the limited number of available studies reducing statistical power (for similar results, see  ,  ). \n\nSocial impairments are frequent in several basal ganglia disorders (e.g. in Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome) and have been associated with fronto-striatal dysfunctions ( ,  ). Different studies showed that the beta rhythms in basal ganglia during action perception are partially overlapping with the changes reported during action execution ( ,  ,  ), supporting the idea that basal ganglia may support mirror network patterns of activation ( ,  ). Both neuroimaging findings ( ,  ) and neuropsychological studies ( ) support the idea that socio-emotional symptoms in PD are explained by a mirror network alteration, involving also the basal ganglia ( ). \n\nThere is converging evidence that the posterior cerebellum may provide compensatory support to the dysfunctional basal ganglia in PD patients ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Accordingly to our result, several studies included in our   meta  -analysis showed posterior cerebellum activations in PD patients (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Although the direct comparison targeting stronger   meta  -analytic activations in PD than in HC did not yield any significant effects in the posterior cerebellum (possibly due to the limited sample size, see  ,  ,  ), at a qualitative level, we found an activation of the right posterior cerebellum when PD patients were analyzed alone, whereas no comparable activation was found in HC subjects. Based on these qualitative differences alone, and due to the lack of a significant   meta  -analytic effect in the direct comparison, a strong claim for compensatory cerebellar activation in PD patients is not supported. Further evidence in larger study and   meta  -analytic samples is required to better elucidate this issue. \n\n\n### Exploratory analyses \n  \nUsing a less conservative threshold, we found that, during social tasks, healthy control subjects displayed a trend towards significant activation in the left IPL, alongside the left IPS and the left postcentral gyrus. A trend towards a statistically significant activation increase for HC compared to patients with PD in the left IPL and IPS also emerged in the between-group analysis. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging experiments suggested that the parietal cortex is involved in the processing of social and emotional information in HC ( ). A causal role for the parietal cortex in social perception was also supported by the results of a   meta  -analysis on brain lesion studies ( ). \n\nIt has been shown that visual processing of facial emotional expressions leads to activations in the IPL ( ,  ). The IPS seems to support the adaptive online control of actions ( ,  ) and is involved in action goal coding ( ). Both action perception and action execution are represented in the IPS ( ). Moreover, the IPS is also involved in face processing ( ) and emotion differentiation ( ). All these socio-emotional processes are supported by the basic mirror neuron mechanisms, which allow to respond to social stimuli of conspecifics with an internal brain representation of their movements and actions ( ). \n\nOur results, although only trendwise, thus confirm the hypothesis of an impairment of the mirror neuron resonance system in patients with PD. Lesions of IPL\/IPS extending to the somatosensory areas and supramarginal gyrus can lead to social perception deficits ( ). Furthermore, decreased activation and connectivity patterns between the IPL, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) in patients with PD were shown during both resting state conditions ( ) and motor tasks ( ), probably reflecting an impairment in the neural systems supporting motor preparation and initiation ( ). The posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) represents the visual input of the human mirror neuron system, from pSTS the information is forwarded to the parietal cortex ( ). Finally, information is forwarded to the inferior frontal gyrus and the ventral premotor cortex, where action goals are coded ( ). Thus, deactivation of mirror neuron areas in the parietal cortex may be one reason for a deficit in the neural mechanism for social resonance, and may consequently be a putative basis for impaired social perception in PD ( ; see also  ). However, considering that our results only represent a statistical trend, more solid evidence is required to support this interpretation. \n\n\n### Possible confounding variables \n  \nConsidering variability of both clinical conditions and clinical treatment (e.g., levodopa equivalent daily dose) between different patients with PD, it would be important to consider these aspects when investigating the neural outcomes of PD. Particularly, the type of dopaminergic treatment, the use of deep brain stimulation, and a predominant left side motor symptom onset seem to have a noticeable effect on social processing in PD (e.g.,  ). Unfortunately, considering the low number of studies focused on social perception on PD, we were not able to contrast studies with different medication conditions, nor to select only studies using a specific medication condition. Moreover, even within an individual study there can be heterogeneity in the medication status of PD patients (e.g.,  ). Most of the studies included in our   meta  -analysis did not report the side of motor symptom onset, nor information regarding treatment with deep brain stimulation. This is probably why also in other   meta  -analyses on PD these aspects were not considered (e.g.,  ). The lack of control for these clinical variables, however, represents a limitation of our results. For clarity, we provide a table in the   with information pertaining to these clinical aspects for each study (  Table S1  ). \n\n\n### Conclusion and future directions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results suggest that social perception deficits in PD patients involve the left basal ganglia, and we also found a trend toward a decreased activity in the mirror system areas. An important question for future research regards the putative compensatory role of the posterior cerebellum in PD. \n\nAt a practical level, our results can guide the design and the implementation of neuro-psychological training programs for PD patients, supporting the crosstalk between basic scientists and clinical researchers ( ). Action observation training (AOT) in PD patients enhanced the execution of spontaneous movements ( ,  ), and observing and performing a target movement simultaneously aids patient performance ( ). This could happen since these trainings lead to a stronger activation of the brain network that subtends motor control ( ), which is minimally damaged in the first stages of PD (e.g.,  ). This stronger activation may cause a brain system reinforcement, compensating the alterations in motor execution areas. Based on our results, it might be useful to add social stimuli to this training (e.g., images or video clips depicting emotional faces, interacting people, social gestures), promoting the observation and imitation of social behavior, so that PD patients could counteract the deterioration of simulation systems underlying social perception. Critically, the effects of this type of social training may be further enhanced by combining the behavioral approach with posterior cerebellar non-invasive stimulation to boost the compensatory effect of cerebellum activity (e.g.,  ,  ; see also   for a review on the possible benefit in using non-invasive brain stimulation in PD). \n\n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9112018,"text_md5":"9bddd5eb3809ab85493c95067f8d1519","field_positions":{"authors":[0,100],"journal":[101,116],"publication_year":[118,122],"title":[133,215],"keywords":[229,336],"abstract":[349,2030],"body":[2039,37734]},"batch":2,"pmid":35569229,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2022.103031","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9112018","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9112018"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9112018\">9112018<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9112018  Action and emotion perception in Parkinson\u2019s disease: A neuroimaging meta-analysis"}

Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as \u2018emotion,\u2019 \u2018attention,\u2019 \u2018episodic memory,\u2019 etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOnes of main missions of cognitive neuroscience and psychology is to understand each cognitive function   per se   and to understand the human brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. To this end, it is vital to relate dozens of cognitive functions, which will provide integrated views for the entire cognition in the human brain and will enable to characterize each cognitive function by relating it to others. Such understanding will provide testable hypotheses for the cognitive neuroscience and psychology communities. In addition, it will give the artificial intelligence community guidelines and ideas to develop novel brain-inspired AI algorithms ( ). \n\nSeveral efforts in psychology have been conducted to reveal hidden relationships among cognitive functions. Developing atlases and\/or ontologies for psychological concepts is one of these endeavors to do so ( ;  ;  ;  ). Using such ontological data has been shown to be efficient for probing the neural bases of cognitive functions ( ). Therefore, we consider that building atlases and ontological databases for psychological constructs are promising approaches. However, currently existing atlases and ontological databases are highly conceptual but not sufficiently empirical, which means that most of the relationships are proposed based on the \u2018common senses\u2019 in psychology. It also may lead to missing many meaningful relationships latent in the experimental data which have become big data nowadays. Another effort is to compare cognitive concepts (or psychological constructs) with each other by trying to identify relationships in idiosyncratic features or performances in several cognitive tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) as well as by investigating overlaps in neural substrates using neuroimaging and neuropsychological methods ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). While these approaches provide insights based on empirical facts, completing such low-profile tasks exhaustively is challenging. \n\nThe magnitude of such exhaustive explorations of common or dissociated neural bases among many cognitive functions may dampen the willingness of identification of relationships among them. However, leveraging neuroscientific knowledge is still expected to be effective to our aim because the cognitive functions that overlapping brain regions are responsible for should be interrelated. Additionally, we also consider that the cognitive functions that connected brain regions are responsible for should be interrelated. Therefore, the use of large-scale meta-analysis databases with knowledge about network topology of the brain is essential to find relationships among cognitive functions to characterize each function and the entire cognition in the brain. \n\nBrainMap ( ,  ;  ) and Neurosynth ( ;  ) are databases specialized toward linking cognitive functions to brain regions. The former is a manually constructed database and includes activation coordinates and ontological data (e.g., behavioral domain, task paradigm, and stimulus modality) reported in fMRI studies. The latter is an automated database including activation coordinates and terms extracted from fMRI studies. We can reconstruct pseudo-activation patterns underlying the reports in each study using the stored activation coordinates. Therefore, we are able to relate cognitive functions investigated in the study to the (pseudo-)activation patterns. For instance, the BrainMap\u2019s team proposed an approach to provide interpretations of independent components of brain activity based on the cognitive functions ( ;  ;  ). In another instance, brain parcellation related to cognitive functions was performed by applying decoding based on the cognitive data in BrainMap to parcels identified using connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project database ( ). In addition, a Bayesian topic model that relates components of cognitive functions to well-localized brain regions was developed ( ). This enables decoding of functionality, expressed as rich text information, from any pattern of brain activity. The approaches using BrainMap or Neurosynth are effective for identifying functionalities of sub-divided brain areas, such as the temporoparietal junction ( ), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( ), the insula ( ), the striatum ( ), and the medial frontal cortex ( ). More generally, we can construct pseudo-activation maps corresponding to various cognitive functions ( ). Hereafter, we term such a pseudo-activation map cognitive function map (CFM). \n\nHere, we explore the relationships among dozens of cognitive functions on the basis of two simple assumptions: (1) cognitive functions that overlapping brain regions are responsible for should be interrelated, and (2) cognitive functions that connected brain regions are responsible for should be also interrelated. To this end, we analyze the CFMs derived from the meta-analysis database with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Therefore, we consider the relationships among cognitive functions from a network neuroscience perspective, which is the subfield of neuroscience to reveal complex but well-organized interdependencies among brain regions using the methods of network analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We use these methods to reveal relationships among cognitive functions. \n\nIn the present study, we analyzed 109 cognitive functions from the viewpoints of connectivity and network analysis using RSFC. First, we provide a comprehensive view of those cognitive functions by constructing relational mapping among them based on the distances quantified as the strengths of RSFCs between the CFMs. This facilitates understanding the brain as a relational network among cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis (in philosophy) of each cognitive function by sub-dividing corresponding CFM on the basis of the connectivity between each voxel within the CFM and the other CFMs, resulting in decomposition of the concept of the function into several sub-concepts. Next, by applying clustering analysis to the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM RSFC, we constructed a whole-brain parcellation where each parcel is labeled with a vector whose components are the degrees of associations to the 109 cognitive functions. Then, by applying matrix factorization to the matrix constructed by concatenating these vectors, we identified six cognitive factors, including \u2018concept processing,\u2019 \u2018action and expression,\u2019 \u2018vision and attention,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 \u2018value and judgment,\u2019 and \u2018memory.\u2019 Each parcel had degrees of contributions with those factors. Using methods of network analysis to characterize the network consisting of the parcels, we quantified the diversity of the information sources\/receivers for the six factors, identified three densely connected subnetworks which are specialized for \u2018concept processing,\u2019 \u2018action and expression,\u2019 and \u2018vision and attention,\u2019 and found (un-)uniformity of factors associated with the parcels within each network community. \n\nThe goals of our research are to exhaustively reveal relationships among cognitive functions and relationships between cognitive functions and network characteristics in the brain. Although several previous studies partially suggested such relationships by focusing on some part of the cognitive functions, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive effort to those subjects, at least explicitly. Therefore, the main contribution of the present study is, firstly, to provide promising ways to construct comprehensive knowledge of organizations of dozens of cognitive functions as exhaustively as possible. Moreover, we also contribute to providing hopeful ways to reveal relationships between dozens of cognitive functions and network characteristics in the brain. Indeed, we found several new insights into the relationships among cognitive functions and the relationships between cognitive functions and network characteristics. These were achieved by the fusion of large-scale meta-analysis of studies of functional brain mapping and methods in the network analysis. \n\nTaken together, we suggest the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of a task-based fMRI database with network neuroscience approaches to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions to understand each cognitive function   per se   and the human brain as a relational system consisting of cognitive functions. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nFifty-two subjects (21 women) without a history of neurological or psychiatric diseases participated in this study. The mean ages of the male and female subjects were 21.5 and 22.3 years (standard deviation, 1.27 and 6.94 years), respectively. All subjects were right-handed. They had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. We did not use any power analysis to determine the sample size but decided the size by reference to previous resting-state fMRI studies (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). To recruit participants, we mainly used announcements through Web sites (including SNS) and snowball sampling. \n\nThe study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the institutional ethics committee of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), with written informed consent from all subjects, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional ethics committee of the NCNP approved the study protocol (Approval No. A2014-072). \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nWe used a 3T MRI scanner (Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an 8-channel head coil for all measurements. Structural images were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared-rapid-gradient-echo sequence. The parameters used were: flip angle = 8\u00b0, voxel size = 1 mm isotropic, TR = 2000 ms, TI = 990 ms, TE = 4.38 ms, and number of voxels = 208 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 208. Functional images were acquired with a T2 -weighted echo-planar imaging sequence. The parameters used were: flip angle = 90\u00b0, voxel size = 3 mm (isotropic, with no slice gap), TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, and number of voxels = 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 44. The slices were acquired in interleaved order. \n\n\n### Resting-State fMRI \n  \nWe acquired 148 volumes of images. As TR was 3 s, the total acquisition time was approximately 7.4 min. During imaging, a fixation point centered on a gray background was presented. We instructed the subjects to look at the fixation point and to think of nothing in particular. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of MRI Data \n  \nWe performed the preprocessing mainly using FSL (FMRIB Software Library Version 5.0.6 ) ( ). All steps were executed by running commands in FSL from custom-made shell scripts. \n\nFirst, we applied slice-time correction to functional images using the slicetimer command. Next, we conducted head motion correction using the mcflirt command ( ) with the \u2018-stages 4 -sinc_final -meanvol -mats -plots\u2019 option. Afterward, we applied the bet command ( ) to structural images to extract the brain regions from whole images. For these structural images, the flirt command ( ;  ;  ) was executed with the MNI152_T1_2mm_brain template as a reference. In this step, we used six degrees of freedom, resulting in rigid-body transformation. Therefore, we executed this step only for alignment and changing the resolution to 2 mm. Then, we applied the bet command to the mean functional image and obtained registration parameters of the image to the 2-mm-resolution structural image using the flirt command. Using these parameters, we registered all functional images to the 2 mm-resolution structural image, resulting in 2-mm-resolution functional images. Next, we obtained non-linear transformation parameters by applying the fnirt command to the 2-mm-resolution structural image, with the MNI152_T1_2mm template as a reference. Then, we transformed the 2-mm-resolution functional images using the applywarp command with the non-linear transformation parameters. This yielded 2-mm-resolution functional images that were standardized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 space. Additionally, we masked these functional images with the regions of the MNI152 standard brain and smoothed them with a 5-mm full-width at half-maximum. These functional images were used in the following analyses. \n\nAdditionally, the structural image was standardized into the 1-mm-resolution MNI 152 space followed by the recon-all process in Freesurfer (version 5.3.0 ). This yielded cortical and subcortical atlases ( ;  ) standardized into the 1-mm-resolution MNI 152 space. \n\nIn the analyses for the resting-state fMRI shown in the following subsections, we excluded subjects whose translational head motions were 1 mm or more or whose rotational head motions were 1\u00b0 or more, since head motion severely affects the inference of RSFC ( ;  ). Our criterion is more stringent compared with the conventional criteria from previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). According to the criterion, we excluded twenty-five subjects We did not adopt any other criterion for excluding data. \n\n\n### Whole-Brain Anatomical Atlas \n  \nTo construct a whole-brain anatomical atlas, we used the output files of the recon-all process in Freesurfer. As described above, the input file for the process was an individual structural image standardized into the MNI152 space. Therefore, the output file provided the whole-brain atlas for each subject standardized into the MNI152 space. In this atlas, each voxel is labeled with an intensity to specify the anatomical area according to the Freesurfer convention. \n\nWe decomposed the whole-brain atlas for each subject to the anatomical regions. For each region, we aggregated the atlases for all subjects into one average atlas by the following method. First, for each voxel, we counted the number of subjects whose individual atlases for the region included the voxel and assigned it to the voxel. Then, we binarized the resulting image with a threshold of the number of subjects for the inclusion of voxels into the aggregated atlas, which made the number of voxels in the image closest to the mean of the number of voxels composing the region across the subjects. This provided an average atlas across the subjects for the anatomical regions. Finally, we merged these average atlases into one whole-brain anatomical atlas on the MNI152 standardized brain. In this whole-brain atlas, each voxel is labeled with the intensity indicating the corresponding anatomical region in a manner following the Freesurfer convention. \n\n\n### Construction of Pseudo-Activation Maps \n  \nWe constructed a pseudo-activation map for each cognitive function. To this end, we followed the method based on \u03c7  statistics described previously ( ). We will give an in-depth explanation of the procedure in the remainder of this section. In the procedure, we used version 0.4 of Neurosynth data downloaded from the Neurosynth page on GitHub . \n\nFirst, for the articles registered in Neurosynth data, we obtained titles, keywords, and abstracts by accessing PubMed  using the Entrez Programing Utilities (E-utilities) API  executed from the Biopython module ( ) in Python. Then, we counted the appearances of cognitive concepts in the title, keywords, and abstract for each article. As for the cognitive terms considered in this study, we prepared 702 concepts. Of these, 692 were extracted from the list named \u2018concepts\u2019 in Cognitive Atlas ( ). The extraction date was 8\/18\/2014. We added ten cognitive terms. The cognitive terms that we considered are listed in  . \n\nWe considered a cognitive term to be present in an article if the term appeared one or more times per 100 words in the text merged from the title, keywords, and abstract of the article. We included only the cognitive terms that appeared in ten or more articles in the following analyses. Additionally, we discarded the terms that are used as general words in neuroscience literature, such as \u2018focus\u2019 and \u2018strength.\u2019 Thus, we selected the 121 cognitive terms shown in   as the targets to be considered in this study. \n\nThen, we reconstructed the binary activation map on the 2-mm-resolution MNI 152 brain for each article registered in Neurosynth data by the following steps. First, we transformed the coordinates reported in the Talairach brain into the MNI brain using icbm2tal transform ( ). Then, we assigned the number \u20181\u2019 to the voxels located within 10 mm of the registered coordinates and the number \u20180\u2019 to the other voxels. Based on these binary activation maps, we calculated the \u03c7  statistics for each cognitive term, in which we compared the appearance of the term and activation of the voxel. Additionally, we calculated the \u03d5 coefficients corresponding to the \u03c7  statistics. Thus, we obtained \u03c7  and \u03d5 maps for each cognitive term. For convenience, in the following statistical test, these maps were masked by voxels that were activated in 3% or more articles, which reduced the number of voxels to be tested. \n\nBased on the \u03c7  test using the \u03c7  map, we constructed a pseudo-activation map for each cognitive function in the following manner. We executed multiple-test corrections using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure for controlling the false discovery rate ( ) with   q   = 0.05. This yielded a significant mask for each cognitive function. Additionally, we constructed a mask for each cognitive function where the positive values of \u03d5 coefficients indicated a positive correlation. Applying these masks to \u03c7  or \u03d5 maps, we obtained pseudo-activation maps where the pattern of significant positive activation induced with the cognitive function is expressed. We call these pseudo-activation maps CFMs. In the present study, 109 CFMs had significant voxels. Therefore, we focused on these 109 cognitive functions ( ). \n\n\n### Two-Dimensional Embedding of Cognitive Concepts Based on the CFM-to-CFM RSFC Matrix \n  \nWe constructed a two-dimensional relational map among the 109 cognitive functions based on the time-series data of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals for each CFM. First, we extracted the time-series data of BOLD signals of resting-state fMRI for each voxel in the whole-brain mask. To reduce artifacts due to motion and signal drift, six head motion parameters and six differential values of head motion plus the linear trend and constant component were regressed out. Then, a 0.009\u20130.08 Hz band-pass filter was applied to remove the putative non-neuronal signals according to previous reports ( ;  ;  ;  ). We used the 5th-order Butterworth digital filter. This filter was applied in forward and backward. We confirmed that further increase of the order led to little change the resulting waveform. In addition, the average signals of the gray matter region, white matter region, and ventricles were regressed out. Those data were transformed to   Z  -scores by each voxel to erase the intensity bias between the voxels. For all voxels for all subjects, the maximum and minimums   Z  -scores were 5.32 and \u22124.89, respectively. By applying the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test to each voxel of each subject, we found that 0.38% voxels were judged as non-normal distributions. Such a preprocessing flow was used also in the further analyses described below. \n\nThen, for each subject, we obtained the mean signal for each CFM by averaging the signals across voxels in the CFM. We calculated the correlation matrices between signals of CFMs and averaged them across the subjects, resulting in the CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix. By shifting and scaling the RSFC values, we obtained the CFM-to-CFM similarity matrix in which the minimum and maximum values were 0 and 1, respectively. Applying spectral clustering (see the next paragraph) to the similarity matrix, we identified clusters of cognitive functions. In this step, we determined the number of clusters as the value corresponding to the maximum of silhouette coefficients ( ) up to 12 ( ). \n\nThe reason why we used the spectral clustering to identify the clusters of cognitive functions is that our problem in this analysis was based on the similarity matrix (not on the feature vectors). For convenience to the readers, we give a brief introduction to spectral clustering ( ). The procedure of the spectral clustering consists of two steps. The first step is to embed data into a representational space. In this space, coordinates (or representations) of the data are determined to minimize a loss defined with the similarity matrix and the coordinates. This minimization problem is reduced to the eigenvalue problem. Except for parameters used in the numerical calculus to solve the eigenvalue problem, the parameter that we need to set is the dimension of the representational space that is equal to the number of eigenvectors that we consider. Throughout the present study, we set this value to the same as the number of clusters. The second step is to cluster the data based on the coordinates in the representational space. In this step, we need to determine the way to cluster. Here, we used k-means clustering. \n\nFinally, we applied multidimensional scaling ( ) to the CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix using the scikit-learn module in Python and obtained the relational map that involves two-dimensional embedding of the 109 cognitive functions, in which the well-correlated pairs of cognitive functions were located as closely as possible. To check a distortion caused by the embedding, we calculated the stress that is defined as the difference between given dissimilarities and distances in the embedding space and is the value to be minimized in the multidimensional scaling. \n\n\n### Subparcellation of CFMs \n  \nFor each cognitive function and subject, the resting-state fMRI BOLD signals of the voxels in the corresponding CFM were extracted and preprocessed in the same manner as described in the previous sections. Now we focus on a CFM that we term target CFM. We calculated the correlation values between the processed signals of all voxels in the target CFM and the mean signals obtained from the other CFMs by averaging signals across the voxels belonging to the CFMs. These correlation values were averaged across the subjects. Thus, we obtained the target CFM voxel-to-CFM RSFC matrix. For instance, if we express the number of voxels in the \u2018emotion\u2019 CFM as   N   (emotion), the RSFC matrix has a dimension of   N  (emotion)\u00d7108, since we considered 109 cognitive functions. \n\nThen, we executed principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. We determined the number of principal components required to explain 95% of the total variance. Finally, we applied k-means clustering to the resulting data, in which we set the number of clusters as five. \n\n\n### Whole-Brain Parcellation Based on Voxel-to-CFM Functional Connectivity \n  \nWe conducted whole-brain parcellation based on RSFC. First, we extracted the time series data of BOLD signals of resting-state fMRI for each voxel in the whole-brain mask and calculated the mean signal for each CFM. These procedures were the same as those described above. \n\nFrom these processed data, we obtained a matrix of voxel-to-CFM RSFC by calculating correlation coefficients between the processed BOLD signals of the 160,296 voxels in the whole-brain mask and the processed BOLD signals of the 109 CFMs for each subject. Then, we transformed them into Fisher\u2019s   Z   values and averaged them across the subjects. We applied inverse Fisher\u2019s   Z  -transform to this and obtained the mean voxel-to-CFM RSFC matrix in which each row was a 109-dimension feature vector for each voxel. To reduce the number of dimensions, we performed principal component analysis by solving the eigenvalue problem for the covariant matrix for the voxels. We determined the number of principal components required to explain 95% of the total variance. Based on this dimension-reduced matrix, we constructed a similarity matrix between voxels, where the similarity was defined as the exponential of the correlation coefficient between two voxels. To consider the spatial constraint, we set the similarity between the voxels that were not neighbored to 0, according to a previous study ( ), resulting in a sparse similarity matrix. \n\nTo obtain whole-brain parcellation, we applied multiclass spectral clustering ( ) to this similarity matrix using the scikit-learn module in Python with \u2018discretize\u2019 (to use the optimal discretization approach searching a discrete partition closest to the continuous representations to identify data clusters in the representational space identified with spectral embedding) and \u2018amg\u2019 options. (The reason why we adopted the spectral clustering in this analysis was to use the spatial constraint mentioned above.) Since this algorithm requires the similarity matrix to be connected, we randomly chose 500,000 pairs of voxels and assigned them a weak positive value (0.0001). We set the number of clusters to 200 that was determined by reference to several existing atlases ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This resulted in whole-brain parcellation with 199 parcels. One cluster was discarded because it was empty (no voxel). We assigned each parcel a label vector that was the mean voxel-to-CFM RSFC obtained by averaging voxel-to-CFM RSFCs across the voxels belonging to the parcel, which represents the relatedness between the parcel and the 109 cognitive functions (parcel-to-CFM RSFC matrix). \n\n\n### Dimensionality Reduction Using the Non-negative Matrix Factorization \n  \nWe applied the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) ( ,  ) to the parcel-to-CFM matrix to reduce the dimensionality, which was executed using the NIMFA module ( ) in Python. Before this process, we set the negative values in the matrix to 0. \n\nThe NMF is a method to decompose a non-negative data matrix (  X  ) into a non-negative coefficient matrix (  Y  ) and a non-negative basis matrix (  Z  ). The objective of the NMF is to approximate   X   by   YZ  . Thus, we used the Frobenius norm ||  X\u2212YZ  ||  as the cost function and minimized it subject to the   Y   \u2265 0 and   Z   \u2265 0. Our purpose in the dimensionality reduction was to identify well-interpretable low dimensional representations for the parcels. In the preprocessing procedure, we regressed the mean time-course of the gray matter signals out from the BOLD data. Although this is efficient to remove artifacts resulting from biological and equipment factors ( ;  ;  ), it is suggested that this procedure tends to cause artifactual negative correlation ( ;  ). Therefore, to lead better interpretation for the parcels, focusing only on the positive RSFCs is appropriate. Therefore, we chose the NMF as the way for dimensionality reduction. \n\nThe number of factors is a key parameter to be predefined in the NMF. A previous study suggests that the inflection point in the decrementing line of residual sum of squares (RSSs) with an increment of the values of the numbers of factors yields the adequate number ( ). We can detect the inflection point as the crossing point between the curved lines fitted to RSSs before and after the point. Therefore, we first calculated the differentials of the RSSs and fitted them to straight lines. We repeated the linear regression and obtained the sums of the squared errors of before-point and after-point lines while changing the point. We determined the inflection point as the point realizing the minimum value of the summed squared error ( ). Using the value corresponding to the point as the number of factors, we conducted the NMF with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based initialization ( ). \n\nSince the output vectors constituting the bases were not normalized, we scaled them to generate unit vectors and applied the inverse operation of the scaling to the coefficient matrix to keep the product invariant. \n\n\n### Heat-Diffusion Analysis of Information Sources\/Receivers \n  \nWe extracted the time series data of BOLD signals of resting-state fMRI for each parcel in the whole-brain parcellation obtained above. These data were preprocessed in the same manner described in the previous sections. We calculated correlation coefficients between the processed BOLD signals of the parcels and obtained a parcel-to-parcel RSFC matrix averaged across subjects. We set the negative values and diagonal components in the matrix to 0 and treated it as an adjacency matrix   A  . In addition, we defined the degree matrix   D   in which the diagonal components were   D   = \u2211  A   and the other components were 0. From these matrices, we defined graph Laplacian matrix   L   =   D\u2212A   ( ), which is the homolog of the negative Laplacian \u2212\u2207 . \n\nFor each NMF factor, we regarded the values of the NMF coefficients as the intensities of the heat sources distributed over the parcels. Based on the heat source distribution, we calculated the steady temperature distribution on the graph whose links were defined by the adjacency matrix   A   between parcels as graph nodes in the following manner, according to a procedure developed in network theory ( ). In the usual partial differential equations, the temperature diffusion \u03c8 with heat sources   f   is governed by the equation \u2202\u2061  \u03c8  \/\u2202\u2061t =   D  \u2207 \u2061  \u03c8  \u2212  \u03b2   \u03c8   + f, where   D   is a diffusion coefficient and \u03b2 is a decay constant. As an analog of this equation for the graph, we obtained the equation \u2202\u2061\u03c8\/\u2202\u2061t = \u2212  D  L\u03c8\u2212  \u03b2  \u03c8 + f, where   f   is the vector of heat source distribution defined as the NMF coefficient. As we consider the steady state \u2202\u2061\u03c8\/\u2202\u2061t = 0. Therefore, the steady temperature distribution is \u03c8 = (  D   L   +   \u03b2   E  ) f, where   E   is an identity matrix. We set   D=1   and   \u03b2   = 1 in the main analysis. \n\nThe temperature distribution was calculated for each NMF factor. The temperature of the parcels for each NMF factor represents a degree of information conveyed from the factor. Thus, each parcel has a vector of temperatures of the NMF factors. From the vector, we calculated the Gini coefficients that represent disparity of conveyed information among the NMF factors. If a parcel receives information from only one factor, the value of the Gini coefficient becomes 1. Conversely, if a parcel receives information from all factors uniformly, the value becomes 0. \n\nWe defined the Gini coefficient for each cognitive function as the mean of 10 Gini coefficients of parcels whose parcel-to-CFM RSFCs for the function were the top ten values. In other words, we averaged the ten Gini coefficients of parcels that were the most related to the cognitive function and considered the resulting mean as the Gini coefficient for the function. \n\nIn an additional analysis, we investigated the effects of the parameter values. Since the result is dependent only on the ratio of   D   and \u03b2, only   D   was varied and \u03b2 was fixed (  \u03b2   = 1). Here, we compared the Gini coefficients between NMF factors. For each factor, we calculated an inner product between the vector of the Gini coefficients for cognitive functions defined above and the vector of the corresponding NMF basis that was normalized to make the summation one. We call this inner product weighted sum of the Gini coefficients. Intuitively, the weighted sum of the Gini coefficients expresses the mean of the Gini coefficients for the cognitive functions assigned to the factor. \n\n\n### Local Density Identification in the Parcel-to-Parcel Network Using Clique Percolation \n  \nIn this analysis, we first created the parcel-to-parcel network by defining the connectivity among parcels by thresholding the adjacency matrix   A   with 0.3. Then, we applied the clique percolation method ( ) to this network to investigate the local densities of connectivity in this network using the networkX Python module. In graph theory, K-clique implies the fully connected subgraph consisting of K nodes. In the clique percolation method, first, K-cliques are identified. Then, pairs of K-cliques are connected to form a cluster if they share a (K-1)-clique. Furthermore, if the cluster shares a (K-1)-clique with another K-clique, it is assimilated to the cluster. This process is iteratively executed. When we set K to a large value, the resulting cluster becomes a densely connected subgraph. \n\n\n### Community Analysis on the Parcel-to-Parcel RSFC Matrix \n  \nBy shifting and scaling the values in the parcel-to-parcel RSFC matrix, we first obtained the parcel-to-parcel similarity matrix in which the minimum and maximum values were 0 and 1, respectively. To identify the community structure in the parcels based on the similarity matrix, we applied spectral clustering to the parcel-to-parcel similarity matrix using the scikit-learn module in Python. As is the case with the clustering of cognitive functions, we used the k-means method to identify data clusters in the representational space identified with spectral embedding. The number of communities was set at the value maximizing the silhouette coefficients ( ) up to 20 ( ). The other parameters were set to the default values. \n\n\n### Reliability Check of RSFC Matrices \n  \nSince the analyses described in the above subsections were basically based on the RSFC matrices defined as the correlation matrices, checking the reliabilities of the estimations is worthful to evaluate the stabilities of the results. Especially, we should be careful about the possible instabilities that might be caused by the smaller data size compared to the data stored in the recently developing large-scale databases such as the Human Connectome Project database ( ;  ). To this end, we calculated the standard errors of means (SEMs) of the RSFCs. Accordingly, we observed the small levels of the values (\u223c0.035) compared to the absolute RSFC values ( ), which means that the effects of the instabilities caused by the small data size were substantially limited. \n\nWe also conducted a correlation analysis between the RSFCs estimated from the present data and the Human Connectome Project data ( ). We used only 706 of about 2000 data in S500 dataset because of resource limitation. The preprocessing pipeline was the same as the one explained above. The correlation coefficients are acceptable (0.94 for CFM-to-CFM RSFCs, 0.84 for voxel-to-CFM RSFCs, and 0.58 for parcel-to-parcel RSFCs). Again, those results suggest that the small size of the present data affected the results limitedly. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Relational Mapping for Cognitive Functions \n  \nIn the present study, we aimed to elucidate the relationships among the cognitive functions in the human brain. To obtain a comprehensive overview of the human cognition, a visualization of the whole picture representing the relationships among cognitive functions is required. To this end, we began our analysis with the 109 CFMs which were reconstructed as pseudo-activation maps corresponding to 109 cognitive functions ( ). By applying multidimensional scaling to the CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix (  and  ), we provided a relational mapping that involved two-dimensional embedding of the cognitive functions, in which the closely related cognitive functions were located close to each other ( ). In addition, we identified six clusters of cognitive functions (cognitive clusters) using the spectral clustering method with the silhouette coefficients (  and  ). Roughly, the red-purple cluster included \u2018self and others\u2019-related functions, the blue cluster included \u2018executive function\u2019-related functions, the orange cluster included \u2018language\u2019-related functions, the yellowish-green cluster included \u2018value and judgment\u2019-related functions, the red cluster included \u2018action and expression\u2019-related functions, and the green cluster included \u2018vision and attention\u2019-related functions. \n  \nRelational mapping and clustering of cognitive functions based on the cognitive function map (CFM)-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities (RSFCs).   (A)   Examples of the reconstructed CFMs.   (B)   The CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix.   (C)   Relational mapping of cognitive functions. The locations of cognitive functions in the two-dimensional plane were determined by applying multidimensional scaling to the CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix. Furthermore, spectral clustering was applied and resulted in six clusters of cognitive functions, in which, roughly, the red-purple cluster included \u2018self and others\u2019-related functions, the blue cluster included \u2018executive function\u2019-related functions, the orange cluster included \u2018language\u2019-related functions, the yellowish-green cluster included \u2018value and judgment\u2019-related functions, the red cluster included \u2018action and expression\u2019-related functions, and the green cluster included \u2018vision and attention\u2019-related functions. \n    \nClustering of the cognitive functions based on the CFM-to-CFM RSFC matrix. \n    \nTo check a distortion caused by the embedding, for each embedding dimension up to ten, we calculated the stress that is an index quantifying the deviation of distances in the embedding space from the distances defined based on the similarity matrix. The decline of stress is shown as the scree plot in  . According to the scree criterion, an optimal dimension seems to be four. Although the two-dimensional mapping has good readability, this means that it was somewhat distorted and could not exactly express the strengths of the RSFCs between the CFMs. Therefore, we also provide figures that are similar to   but show the positive and negative strengths of RSFCs using red and blue colors, respectively ( ). \n\n\n### RSFC-Based Conceptual Analysis of Cognitive Functions \n  \nOne of the bottlenecks preventing us from understanding information processing during cognitive functions is that we do not have sufficient in-depth knowledge of the concepts of these cognitive functions. Therefore, we require so-called conceptual analysis of the cognitive functions (based not on philosophical deliberation but on neuroscientific evidence) to elucidate their deeper meanings. Here, we propose a method of conceptual analysis based on the voxel-to-CFM RSFCs ( ). In this method, first, we selected a cognitive function (e.g., \u2018emotion\u2019) and the corresponding CFM. For all voxels within the selected CFM and the 108 remaining CFMs, a voxel-to-CFM RSFC matrix was constructed ( ). Then, we applied k-means clustering to the matrix and subdivided the CFM for the cognitive function into five clusters ( ). Finally, each cluster was related to the 108 remaining cognitive functions based on cluster-to-CFM RSFCs. \n  \nConceptual analysis of cognitive functions based on subdivisions of the cognitive function maps (CFMs).   (A)   Schematic illustration of voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities (RSFCs) between voxels in a CFM of cognitive function under consideration (e.g., \u2018emotion\u2019) and the other CFMs.   (B)   Example of subdivision of the CFM of \u2018emotion\u2019 obtained by applying k-means clustering to the CFM. In this analysis, the number of clusters was fixed to five. Each color corresponds to each cluster resulting from the subdivision.   (C)   Examples of subdivision-based conceptual analyses for \u2018emotion\u2019 (upper), \u2018prospective memory\u2019 (middle), and \u2018thought\u2019 (lower). The cluster-to-CFM RSFCs are shown with the names of corresponding cognitive functions. For each cluster, the cluster-to-CFM RSFCs are defined as the mean values of the voxel-to-CFM RSFCs for the voxels belonging to the cluster. \n  \nAs examples, the results for \u2018emotion,\u2019 \u2018prospective memory,\u2019 and \u2018thought\u2019 are shown in  . The subdivision of the \u2018emotion\u2019-corresponding CFM suggests that \u2018emotion\u2019 is constructed of the subfunctions related to decision-making (cluster 1), vision (cluster 2), self and others\u2019 minds (cluster 3), fear (cluster 4), and comprehension of abstract meanings (cluster 5). The subdivision of the \u2018prospective memory\u2019-corresponding CFM suggests that \u2018prospective memory\u2019 is constructed of the subfunctions related to memory (cluster 1), intelligent decision (cluster 2), motion (cluster 3), emotional decision (cluster 4), and executive function (cluster 5). The subdivision of the \u2018thought\u2019-corresponding CFM suggests that \u2018thought\u2019 is constructed of the subfunctions related to self and others\u2019 minds (cluster 1), imaginary navigation (cluster 2), logical intention and intelligence (cluster 3), emotional decision (cluster 4), and memory (cluster 5). \n\nThe results for all cognitive functions are provided in  . In this analysis, we set the numbers of clusters identical (i.e., five) across all CFMs by considering interpretability. On the other hand, showing results from the clustering in which the numbers of clusters were determined based on the silhouette coefficients are beneficial. Therefore, we provide these results in which the numbers of clusters were determined based on the silhouette coefficients (up to twelve clusters) in  . \n\nThe nifti-formatted images of the subdivided CFMs will be downloadable from the authors\u2019 web page. \n\n\n### Cognitive Function-Based Whole-Brain Parcellation \n  \nNetwork analyses using brain parcels that are associated with cognitive functions as network nodes are promising to offer insights into the characteristics of each function   per se   and the relationships among those functions. To construct such parcels, we administered a novel whole-brain parcellation method in which voxels were assembled to one of 199 clusters (or parcels) by applying spectral clustering to the voxel-to-CFM RSFC matrix ( ). Each resulting parcel was characterized by its relatedness with the 109 cognitive functions (i.e., parcel-to-CFM RSFCs), defined as mean voxel-to-CFM RSFCs over the voxels belonging to the parcel (  and  ). Their links to the anatomical brain regions are provided in  . \n  \nWhole-brain parcellation based on cognitive function maps (CFMs).   (A)   Schematic illustration of voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities (RSFCs). A correlation coefficient between resting-state activities of each voxel and CFM was calculated, and was defined as the RSFC between them.   (B)   Parcellation was obtained by applying spectral clustering to the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM RSFC matrix. Each panel on the right corresponds to each resulting parcel.   (C)   The resulting parcellation consisting of 199 parcels. \n    \nExamples of parcels resulting from cognitive function-based whole-brain parcellation. Four examples of the parcels. Maps on a standard brain (left in each parcel) and top 10 relatedness with cognitive functions (right in each panel) are shown. The relatedness was defined as mean voxel-to-cognitive function map resting-state functional connectivities over the voxels belonging to the parcel. \n  \nWe also show the correspondence between the present parcellation and the Glasser\u2019s atlas ( ) in  . We found that the voxels belonging to one parcel in the present parcellation are assigned to several parcels in the Glasser\u2019s atlas. This is natural since the number of parcels in the Glasser\u2019s atlas is larger than ours. We show the ratios of voxels assigned to the most overlapping region, the second most overlapping region, the third most overlapping region,\u2026in  . Thirty six percent of the voxels are included in the most overlapping regions in the Glasser\u2019s atlas. Up to the fourth most overlapping regions, 84% of the voxels are included in them. \n\nThe nifti-formatted CFM and parcellation images will be downloadable from the authors\u2019 web page. \n\n\n### Cognitive Factor Identification Based on Dimensionality Reduction Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization \n  \nThe 109 cognitive functions were not independent of each other. Some functions were highly interrelated, and therefore, had common latent cognitive factors. We believe that all cognitive functions can be characterized by combinations of a few latent cognitive factors. When a group of cognitive functions is commonly dependent on such factors, the parcel-to-CFM RSFCs of members of the group should be similar. Thus, to identify the latent cognitive factors, we applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to the parcel-to-CFM RSFC matrix ( ). \n  \nIdentifying cognitive factors using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).   (A)   Procedure for identification of cognitive factors. First, the parcel-to-cognitive function map (CFM) resting-state functional connectivity matrix was thresholded with zero. Then, NMF was applied to the thresholded matrix, and the NMF coefficient and basis matrices were identified. The rows and columns of the NMF coefficient matrix correspond to parcels and NMF factors (cognitive factors), respectively. The rows and columns of the NMF basis matrix correspond to factors and CFMs, respectively.   (B)   The NMF coefficient values for each NMF factor are mapped on the parcels (shown as dots) located according to coordinates on a standard brain using heat mapping. \n  \nThe number of NMF factors was determined to be six according to the evaluation of the residual sum of squares. The top ten components for each basis vector (row vector in the identified NMF basis matrix) with the corresponding cognitive functions are provided in  . All components in the bases are shown in  . The NMF coefficient matrix is shown in  . We found that these cognitive factors roughly corresponded to \u2018concept processing\u2019 (factor 1), \u2018action and expression\u2019 (factor 2), \u2018vision and attention\u2019 (factor 3), \u2018executive function\u2019 (factor 4), \u2018value and judgment\u2019 (factor 5), and \u2018memory\u2019 (factor 6). \n  \nCognitive factors defined using non-negative matrix factorization of the parcel-to-CFM RSFC matrix. \n    \nFor each factor, the heat map of the NMF coefficients for the corresponding parcels are shown in  , in which we observe factor-specific spreading patterns. The factor 1-related parcels are located on the left inferior parietal cortex, left superior and middle temporal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior frontal cortex. The factor 2-related parcels are located on the bilateral sensorimotor areas and the superior temporal cortices. The factor 3-related parcels are located on the bilateral occipital cortices. The factor 4-related parcels are located on the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices and supramarginal gyri. The factor 5-related parcels are located on the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices. The factor 6-related parcels are located on the bilateral precuneus areas and the inferior parietal cortices. \n\n\n### Diversity of Information Sources\/Receivers Is Dependent on Cognitive Factors \n  \nSome cognitive functions may need various kinds of information to be realized while others may require only limited kinds of information. Similarly, information derived from some cognitive functions may be required to realize various kinds of cognitive functions while other information may be needed only from a small number of cognitive functions. We considered the diversity of informational interactions to be dependent on cognitive factors. Therefore, we quantified the diversity of information sources or receivers that were collected by parcels in the parcel network. To clarify our method, we assumptively describe some parcels, functions, or factors as   sources   in the present section. However, we note that these may be   receivers   because our method did not identify the directions of informational interactions. \n\nFirst, for each parcel, we defined information sent from a cognitive factor as steady pseudo-temperature calculated from the heat diffusion equation in the network with heat sources whose intensities were defined by the NMF coefficient vector (column vector of the NMF coefficient matrix) ( ). This resulted in a temperature distribution over the parcel network for each cognitive factor. We observed that the temperatures of some parcels were roughly uniform across all cognitive functions, which implies equal collection of information. On the other hand, in another parcel, only one factor provided a high temperature and the other factors provided low temperatures, which implies a polarized collection of information. To quantify the degree of polarization, we used the Gini coefficients of the distributions of temperatures across cognitive factors ( ). Smaller Gini coefficients express more uniformity over cognitive factors, suggesting more diverse information sources\/receivers. \n  \nCognitive factor-dependent diversity of informational interactions.   (A)   Heat source (left) and temperature (right) distributions on the parcels for the cognitive factor 1. The heat source values were defined as the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) coefficient values of the corresponding column. Temperatures were calculated at steady states of the diffusion process governed by the graph Laplacian.   (B)   The Gini coefficient distribution. For each parcel, the Gini coefficient represents inhomogeneity of temperatures across the factors. The Gini coefficients and polar graph of temperature for the parcel circled with magenta and blue are shown on the right.   (C)   Example plots between the Gini coefficient values and parcel-to-cognitive function map (CFM) resting-state functional connectivities (RSFCs). Upper and lower plots correspond to the CFMs of \u2018episodic memory\u2019 and \u2018object recognition,\u2019 respectively. Each dot expresses each parcel. The parcels that have the 10 largest RSFCs are red-colored. The means and standard deviations of the Gini coefficients for these red-colored parcels are shown as the centers and radiuses of the red circles, respectively. The means are also indicated by the red dotted line.   (D)   The transposed NMF basis matrix, sorted by the Gini coefficients. The cognitive function corresponding to each CFM is shown on the right. \n  \nMoreover, we investigated the 109 cognitive functions in terms of the diversity of information sources\/receivers. For each cognitive function (or CFM), we averaged the Gini coefficients of the parcels whose parcel-to-CFM RSFCs were among the top ten ( ). The resulting value was regarded as the Gini coefficient for the corresponding cognitive function. Upon sorting the NMF bases by the Gini coefficients of the cognitive functions, we observed cognitive factor-dependent differences in the diversity of information sources\/receivers (  and  ). The factor 6-related cognitive functions tended to collect information from the most diverse sources\/receivers. The factor 5- and 4-related functions had the second- and third-most diverse information sources\/receivers, respectively. The diversity of information sources\/receivers for the factor 1-related functions was moderate. The factor 2- and 3-related functions collected information from the most polarized sources\/receivers. \n\nThe method used in this section has two parameters: diffusion coefficient   D   and decay constant \u03b2. Therefore, as an additional analysis, we investigated the effects of those parameter values. Since the result is only dependent on the ratio of those parameters, we only varied the diffusion coefficient  D  . As we observed, the Gini coefficients for the cognitive functions highly loaded by some factors were small and others were large. Thus, we compared the weighted sums of the Gini coefficients that express the means of the Gini coefficients for the cognitive functions assigned to the factors (see section Materials and Methods) between factors ( ). Throughout the parameter region, we found qualitatively similar results to the one shown above except for the factor 3 that relates to vision and attention. The value of the weighted sum of the Gini coefficients for the factor 3 was largest when the diffusion coefficient was small, which means that the diversity of information sources\/receivers was lowest. However, the diversity (indexed with the weighted sum of the Gini coefficients) relative to the others increased with an increase in the diffusion coefficient, and, finally became highest. Since the diffusion coefficient decides the range of information transmission, this result suggests the factor 3 (relating vision and attention) changes the relative diversity of informational interactions depending on the state of information transmission. \n  \nEffect of the value of the diffusion coefficient on the weighted sum of the Gini coefficient. Log-log plots of the weighted sums of Gini coefficients with varying the diffusion coefficient. Throughout the parameter region, relative orders are qualitatively similar except for the factor 3. The weighted sum of Gini coefficients for factor 3 moves from largest (i.e., lowest diversity of informational interaction) to smallest (i.e., highest diversity of informational interaction). \n  \n\n### Cognitive Factor-Dependent Difference in Densities of Local Connectivity \n  \nThe connection density of network which processes a cognitive function is an important factor to specify computational characteristics of the function. Using the clique percolation method, we identified local subnetworks within the parcels that were densely connected ( ). By increasing the clique threshold K, subnetworks whose connectivity were denser came to the surface. When K was set to 8, we identified three densely connected subnetworks. By extracting the NMF coefficients for the parcels belonging to densely connected subnetworks, we found that these subnetworks were highly related with the factors 1 (blue), 2 (yellow), and 3 (green). The parcels composing each subnetwork are shown with the anatomical information in  . \n  \nIdentifying densely connected subnetworks using clique percolation method. Subnetworks are color-coded and the non-negative matrix factorization coefficients of the parcels belonging to the subnetworks are shown in corresponding colors. The clique threshold K is a criterion for densities of connectivity in subnetworks to be identified. The connectivity becomes dense with an increase in K. When   K   = 3, all parcels were interconnected, which implies only one network was identified. When   K   = 5, 11 subnetworks were identified. When   K   = 8, three subnetworks were identified, in each of which the parcels were densely interconnected. \n  \nThe blue densely connected subnetwork includes the following regions: the left temporal cortex, left inferior parietal cortex, left supramarginal gyrus, left orbitofrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis), left superior frontal cortex, left rostral middle frontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, left frontal pole, and a small part of the left temporal pole. \n\nThe yellow densely connected subnetwork includes the following regions: the bilateral putamen, bilateral pallidum, bilateral caudal anterior cingulate cortices, bilateral posterior cingulate cortices, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyri, bilateral transverse temporal gyri, bilateral superior parietal cortices, bilateral supramarginal gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral precentral gyri, bilateral postcentral gyri, bilateral paracentral lobules, bilateral insula, bilateral pars opercularis (mainly left), and the bilateral superior frontal gyri (slightly lateralized to the left hemisphere). \n\nThe green densely connected subnetwork includes the following regions: the bilateral cerebellum, bilateral lateral occipital cortices, bilateral cuneus, bilateral pericalcarine cortices, bilateral lingual gyri, bilateral fusiform gyri, bilateral inferior parietal cortices, and the bilateral superior parietal cortices. Additionally, a small part of the inferior temporal cortex is included. \n\n\n### Network Communities That Are Uniformly or Diversely Associated With Cognitive Factors \n  \nPrevious studies suggest that the RSFC network has a modular or community structure ( ;  ;  ,  ). Such a community is considered as a module of information processing. To elucidate the information processing executed in each community, it is important to reveal whether the community is related to uniform or diverse kinds of cognitive functions. To this end, we identified the community structure by applying spectral clustering to the parcel-to-parcel RSFC matrix and investigated the functional uniformity or diversity of each community ( ). The number of communities was set to 10, which maximized the silhouette coefficients. The NMF coefficients for the parcels belonging to the identified communities showed uniformity and diversity in their association with the cognitive factors in a community-dependent manner. The communities 2 and 8 specifically associated with cognitive factors 3 and 2, respectively. Conversely, the community 4, which was mainly located in the cerebellum, associated with diverse cognitive factors. \n  \nCharacterizing communities in the whole-brain network with the cognitive factors. Ten network communities were identified using spectral clustering. The parcels belonging to each community are shown by magenta dots. For each community, the subpart of the non-negative matrix factorization coefficient matrix corresponding to the parcels in the community is shown on the right. The lowest row shows the row mean of the matrix. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we endeavored to show a whole picture of the human cognition and to reveal characteristics of each cognitive function that constitutes it. To this end, we investigated the relationships among 109 cognitive functions based on two ideas: (1) the cognitive functions that overlapping brain regions are responsible for should be interrelated, and (2) the cognitive functions that connected brain regions are responsible for should be also interrelated. Especially, we characterized 109 cognitive functions based on the CFM and RSFC-determined relationships among them. First, we presented a relational mapping that involved two-dimensional embedding of the cognitive functions using the RSFCs among CFMs. Then, we performed conceptual analysis in which a cognitive function was analyzed to identify the subfunctions constituting it, based on the RSFCs between voxels in the targeted CFM and the remaining CFMs. Moreover, we obtained a novel whole-brain parcellation in which each parcel had the vector of relatedness with these cognitive functions. Based on the network analyses using the parcels, we identified six cognitive factors, quantified the diversity of information sources\/receivers for each cognitive function and factor, found the densely connected subnetworks associated with specific cognitive factors, and identified the communities that were associated with uniform or diverse cognitive factors. Altogether, we suggest the effectiveness of our approach in which we combined a large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions to understand each cognitive function   per se   and the human as a relational system consisting of cognitive functions. \n\n### Implications of the Results and Comparisons With Previous Studies \n  \nCategorization of cognitive functions is an essential first step not only for the scientific understanding of the brain but also for the clinical application of neuroscientific knowledge for diagnosis of psychiatric diseases. In this study, we provided such categorizations using two methods. One was based on the clustering on the CFM-to-CFM network and also yielded six cognitive clusters, including \u2018language,\u2019 \u2018action and expression,\u2019 \u2018vision and attention,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 \u2018value and judgment,\u2019 and \u2018self and others.\u2019 The other was based on the NMF, and yielded six cognitive factors: \u2018concept processing,\u2019 \u2018action and expression,\u2019 \u2018vision and attention,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 \u2018value and judgment,\u2019 and \u2018memory.\u2019 \n\nWe show the entire correspondences between the cognitive clusters and the factors in  . The cognitive factors \u2018action and expression,\u2019 \u2018vision and attention,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 and \u2018value and judgment\u2019 roughly correspond to the cognitive clusters that are labeled with the same names. The \u2018memory\u2019 factor mainly relates to the \u2018self and others\u2019 cluster. Additionally, we like to stress that several functions that are strongly associated with the \u2018memory\u2019 factor (e.g., \u2018memory retrieval\u2019 and \u2018prospective memory\u2019) belong to the \u2018executive function\u2019 cluster. The \u2018concept processing\u2019 factor seems to relate to the cognitive clusters in a complex manner. Considering the NMF basis vector, it is suggested to be related to both \u2018language\u2019 and \u2018self and others\u2019 clusters. Therefore, the concepts of \u2018memory,\u2019 \u2018concept processing,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 \u2018language,\u2019 and \u2018self and others\u2019 are entangled, and the information processing relating these concepts may be executed through close interactions among them. \n  \nCorrespondences between cognitive clusters and factors. Correlation coefficients between NMF basis vectors for the factors and presence\/absence vectors of cognitive functions for the clusters are shown. In the presence\/absence vectors, the presences and absences in the cluster were assigned to \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019, respectively. \n  \nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which describes the current standardized criteria to diagnose psychiatric diseases, the neurocognitive domain is categorized into six subdomains consisting of \u2018complex attention,\u2019 \u2018executive function,\u2019 \u2018learning and memory,\u2019 \u2018language,\u2019 \u2018perceptual-motor,\u2019 and \u2018social cognition\u2019 ( ). We found rough correspondences between the categorizations in DSM-5 and our results. The \u2018complex attention\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 is considered to be included in the \u2018vision and attention\u2019 cognitive factor and cluster in the present study. The \u2018executive function\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 probably corresponds to the cognitive factor and cluster labeled with the same name in this study. The \u2018learning and memory\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 mainly relates to the \u2018memory\u2019 factor in this study. Since the immediate memory is included in the \u2018learning and memory\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5, this may relate to the \u2018executive function\u2019 cognitive factor and cluster in this study that involves \u2018maintenance\u2019 and \u2018working memory.\u2019 The \u2018language\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 roughly corresponds to the \u2018language\u2019 cluster in our analysis. Furthermore, it also relates to the \u2018action and expression\u2019 cluster in this study because it includes \u2018syntax,\u2019 \u2018listening,\u2019 \u2018communication,\u2019 and so on. Additionally, the \u2018language\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 probably has a close relationship with the \u2018concept processing\u2019 and \u2018action and expression\u2019 factors in this study. The \u2018perceptual-motor\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 mainly relates to the \u2018action and expression\u2019 and \u2018vision and attention\u2019 factors and clusters in this study. The \u2018social cognition\u2019 subdomain in DSM-5 mainly relates to the \u2018value and judgment\u2019 and \u2018self and others\u2019 clusters in this study. It may also relate to the \u2018concept processing\u2019 and \u2018value and judgment\u2019 factors. \n\nThe relational mapping among cognitive functions that we obtained provides several insights into the mechanisms of cognition. We found that the default-mode network was located in a position close to \u2018self and others\u2019-related cognitive functions (e.g., \u2018theory of mind\u2019 and \u2018autobiographical memory\u2019) and social cognitive functions (e.g., \u2018social cognition\u2019 and \u2018decision-making\u2019). In fact, many studies suggest that these cognitive functions share underlying neural substrates ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We also found that \u2018phonological processing\u2019 was located close to the \u2018executive function\u2019 cluster. This seems to be consistent with Baddeley\u2019s working memory system ( ), in which phonological loop interacts with central execution. From the same point of view, we can link \u2018episodic memory\u2019 with episodic buffer in Baddeley\u2019s system, since it was also located close to the \u2018executive function\u2019 cluster. More globally, we observed that the \u2018executive function\u2019 cluster neighbored the \u2018self and others\u2019 cluster, centering on the \u2018default-mode network.\u2019 Several studies reported cooperative activity between the brain areas related to these cognitive functions when subjects experienced spontaneous thoughts ( ) and engaged in creative tasks ( ) and mental simulations ( ). Thus, our relational mapping of cognitive functions provides a whole picture of cognition which is feasible because it includes many known neurocognitive relationships. A study to survey relationships among cognitive functions whose aim was similar to ours was conducted using text analysis of neuroscience literature ( ). In this study, the authors identified networks among 100 cognitive concepts, among 100 anatomical regions, and among combinations of both on the basis of the co-occurrences of the terms in the texts. More recently, a study reported the relations among 120 cognitive functions using hierarchical clustering based on correlations between pseudo-activation patterns, not RSFCs ( ). Owing to methodological variations between the present and those studies, the present study can endow another picture complementing these studies. \n\nIn the present study, we proposed a novel method for conceptual analysis of cognitive concepts based on the CFMs and RSFCs in the brain. This yielded functional subdivisions of the cognitive concepts. Each sub-concept was characterized by its relatedness with the other cognitive concepts. We found several unexpectedly characterized sub-concepts. A sub-concept of \u2018emotion\u2019 that is characterized by functionality involving comprehension of abstract meanings is one such unexpected sub-concept. This may imply that we need emotional processing to receive an implicit message from linguistic expressions. Conversely, emotional processing may require analysis of abstract meanings. Further, we found that \u2018thought\u2019 had a sub-concept related to imaginary navigation. Navigation is considered to be handled by the grid and place cell systems. Several studies have shown that these systems play roles not only in physical spaces but also in abstract spaces such as social relationships, features of objects and events, and relational knowledge ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, imaginary navigation in an abstract space may be generally used in thoughts. \n\nIn the analysis for diversity of informational interactions, we observed that the nodes associated with cognitive functions that were closely related to the \u2018memory\u2019 factor interacted with the most diverse information. Since our analyses did not indicate the directions of the interactions, it was not clear whether these nodes were information sources or receivers. If the nodes play the role of information source, our result suggests that information processed with \u2018memory\u2019-related functions is necessary to realize a wide range of cognitive functions. Conversely, if the nodes are receivers of information, it suggests that execution of \u2018memory\u2019-related cognitive functions need information from a wide range of cognitive functions. Since the \u2018value and judgment\u2019- and \u2018executive function\u2019-related cognitive functions also have relatively diverse informational interactions, these results suggest similar implications. To support these results, an analysis to clarify the interaction directions will be required. In the additional analysis, the behavior of the factor relating to \u2018vision and attention\u2019 is insightful since it suggests that the diversity of informational interaction highly depends on the range of information transmission. Since the efficacy of information transmission changes depending on the brain state such as wakefulness and sleep ( ), our observation may suggest that the role of visual and attentional processing on the entire cognitive information processing changes when the brain state shifts. \n\nWe identified a densely connected subnetwork that was highly related to the \u2018concept processing\u2019 factor as well as the subnetworks related to the \u2018action and expression\u2019 and \u2018vision and attention\u2019 factors. The \u2018concept processing\u2019 subnetwork included a direct pathway between the Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas and an indirect pathway passing through the left inferior parietal cortex, which has been previously identified as constituents of the perisylvian language networks ( ). Moreover, we detected participation of a wide range of structures in the left prefrontal cortex, including the lateral, medial, and orbital regions as well as the frontal pole in this subnetwork. Since these areas involve various aspects of higher-order cognition ( ;  ), this subnetwork suggests the existence of an integrated cognitive function that is highly dependent on language processing but is contributed also from functions beyond language processing. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that functional communities exist in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ). The studies have emphasized functional specificities of the communities. On the other hand, we found differences in the degrees of functional specificities of the communities, in which some communities were specifically associated with one cognitive factor while other communities were associated with diverse cognitive factors. One of the communities associated with the most diverse cognitive factors was located mainly in the cerebellum. Although the cerebellum was previously considered to be related to motor functions, it is now recognized that the cerebellum involves a remarkably wide range of cognitive functions ( ;  ;  ), which is consistent with our results. Viewing the internal models in the cerebellum ( ) as a general controller working on various mental activities may give rise to a theoretical foundation for the diversity of cerebellar functionality ( ). Additionally, a theoretical study ( ) suggests that the cerebellum is considered a kind of universal machine, the so-called liquid state machine ( ), which may also support our finding. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nThere are several limitations to the present study which should be addressed in future studies. While constructing the CFMs, we used abstract texts to count the occurrences of cognitive terms. We did not utilize contextual information. Therefore, we did not discriminate as to whether the occurrences meant activation or deactivation. Additionally, to ensure that a term was the main topic in a study, we only used the frequency of the occurrences in its title, abstract, and keywords. Utilization of contextual information is a promising way to improve our analyses. The methods being developed in the field of natural language processing will probably provide such ways. Additionally, the use of natural language processing technics can provide us useful data revealing the constraints of inferring relationships among cognitive functions. \n\nCompared to the datasets stored in the recently developing large-scale databases such as the Human Connectome Project database ( ;  ), the dataset used in the present study was small with respect to both the number of subjects and the number of scan volumes. Although we checked the reliabilities of the RSFC matrices and we consider that the outlines of the results are validated, especially in details of the results, some instabilities caused by the small data size were probably not removed. Therefore, we should continuously revise and establish knowledge suggested from our observations. \n\nThe number of parcels in the cognitive function-based whole-brain parcellation was determined not based on data but by reference to several existing atlases ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The selection of the number is a trade-off problem. The larger number of parcels results in a set of smaller parcels. This is suitable to reflect spatial heterogeneity in the brain. On the other hand, since the BOLD signal of the parcel is calculated by averaging the signals over the voxels within it, the signal of a smaller parcel tends to be more fluctuated. Several studies suggest that estimations of network characteristics in the brain depend on a resolution of parcellation ( ;  ). Therefore, we need to address the issue of the number of parcels in the future study. \n\nThe connectivity measures used in this study were undirected and did not provide any information regarding dynamic causality and logical orders. On the other hand, we expect that the identification of directions in connectivity will provide useful insights into the issues dealt with in the present study. One representative instance is the analysis of the diversity of informational interactions, in which we found that cognitive functions highly related to the \u2018memory\u2019 factor interact with the most diverse kinds of information. If those cognitive functions are information sources (or receivers), this result suggests certain roles (or mechanisms) of memory-related information processing in the entire cognitive information processing. Similarly, directional information is required in the RSFC-based conceptual analysis, in which we observed that \u2018emotion\u2019 should implicate a sub-concept related to comprehension of abstract meanings. To determine whether emotional processing contributes to comprehension or vice versa, we need to identify the direction of connectivity between the CFM corresponding to \u2018emotion\u2019 and the CFMs of the cognitive functions related to comprehension of abstract meanings. Another instance in which directional information is required is the relational mapping of cognitive functions. This is expected to reveal the hierarchical dependencies among the cognitive functions, which will provide a more sophisticated perspective for the mechanism of the entire human cognition. To these ends, we may use methods of time series analyses, including the dynamic causal modeling ( ,  ), Granger causality ( ;  ), and transfer entropy ( ;  ). \n\nIn our relational mapping, we used multidimensional scaling to embed cognitive functions. Although this method provided an easily interpretable overview of the relationship among cognitive functions, the distances between them were more or less distorted. Therefore, we need more sophisticated embedding methods. The t-SNE may be such a method ( ;  ). Recently, embedding methods into non-Euclidean spaces, such as Poincar\u00e9 embedding, has been proposed ( ). Such a non-Euclidean embedding method is considered to reveal other types of information regarding the relationships among cognitive functions. In addition, on the basis of CFMs, RSFCs, and other useful neuroscientific tools, exploring ontological relations [e.g.,   is-a   and   part-of   relationships ( ;  ;  )] is an important future direction. \n\nThe methods and results provided in the present study let us clarify the meaning of each cognitive concept and obtain an analytic and synthetic understanding of the relationships among cognitive concepts. This possibly provides an empirical sketch of the research domains of cognitive neuroscience, which has been the aim of neuroimaging studies involving meta-analytical methods ( ). Moreover, this will stimulate the research fields of biological brain- and\/or cognition-inspired artificial intelligences ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) by providing guidelines for understanding human cognition as a whole. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nRaw data cannot be shared publicly because the sharing of raw data was not ethically approved.

{"text":"Pastrnak, Martin and Simkova, Eva and Novak, Tomas\nSci Rep, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nInsula activity in resting-state differentiates bipolar from unipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nNeuroscience\nBiomarkers\nMedical research\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nSymptomatic overlap of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major diagnostic and therapeutic problem. Mania in medical history remains the only reliable distinguishing marker which is problematic given that episodes of depression compared to episodes of mania are more frequent and predominantly present at the beginning of BD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a non-invasive, task-free, and well-tolerated method that may provide diagnostic markers acquired from spontaneous neural activity. Previous rs-fMRI studies focused on differentiating BD from MDD depression were inconsistent in their findings due to low sample power, heterogeneity of compared samples, and diversity of analytical methods. This meta-analysis investigated resting-state activity differences in BD and MDD depression using activation likelihood estimation. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies which compared MDD and BD currently depressed patients between Jan 2000 and August 2020. Ten studies were included, representing 234 BD and 296 MDD patients. The meta-analysis found increased activity in the left insula and adjacent area in MDD compared to BD. The finding suggests that the insula is involved in neural activity patterns during resting-state that can be potentially used as a biomarker differentiating both disorders. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDepressive episodes are characteristic for both, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) . Because the diagnostic criteria for depressive episodes are the same in both disorders , establishing the correct diagnosis is difficult yet important as each requires different treatment . \n\nSeveral clinical characteristics and biological markers have been shown to increase the probability of diagnosing BD rather than MDD , but none of them is included in diagnostic criteria, nor generally accepted without further exploration. The presence of mania in medical history remains the only accepted diagnostic marker that differentiates the two disorders. In addition to often unavailable or inconclusive psychiatric history, the diagnostic process is even more difficult given that episodes of BD depression compared to episodes of mania are longer, more frequent, and predominantly present at the beginning of BD . Misdiagnosis is common and presents a dire problem: up to 40\u201360% of bipolar patients are misdiagnosed as unipolar and only 20% receive the correct diagnosis within the first year which may considerably increase risks of inappropriate drug prescription, switching to mania, prolonged illness duration, risk of recurrence, suicide and overall poorer treatment responses . Hence, biologically relevant diagnostic markers of BD and MDD depressions would significantly improve the diagnostic process, yet are still unavailable. \n\nWhile the pathological processes in psychiatric disorders (e.g. MDD and BD) are mostly unknown and the diagnosis is not data-driven and remains a clinical decision, the field of neuroimaging may contribute considerably in identifying biomarkers . If found, rapidly growing advances in technology and data analysis may facilitate the utility of such biomarkers on levels of specificity and sensitivity that is relevant even for clinical use. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging modality that focuses on low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal . As opposed to the paradigm or task-based fMRI, in rs-fMRI the participants are usually asked to lay still in the scanner, with eyes closed or fixated on a cross-hair, and do nothing in particular. Depending on the used method of analysis, rs-fMRI enables to examine patterns of neural activity and connectivity at rest . Rs-fMRI has a high potential for clinical use as it is non-invasive, safe, without task demands on the participants, relatively short, and well-tolerated even by severely depressed individuals . \n\nPresuming depressive episodes manifest with different activity in neurocircuitry in BD and MDD, these should be reflected in rs-fMRI scans. Numerous studies attempted to use rs-fMRI and various approaches to data analysis to find resting-state differences between patients with bipolar and unipolar depression. Mostly dorsolateral prefrontal, limbic, and midline structures were reported as differentiating the disorders in various measures of resting-state , but no conclusive convergence of the results was reported yet. This inconsistency may arise from the diversity of methods used in the analyses, and the heterogeneity of the compared samples, which often differ across studies in size, clinical state, and comorbidities. Also, in fMRI studies, the cluster-wise inference (CWI) approach is often used in statistical analyses. This may present a problem as it was recently suggested that CWI in parametric statistical methods may lead to inflated false-positive rates, especially when lenient or uncorrected cluster-defining threshold is used . Thus, heterogeneity may well result from false positives findings. \n\nA quantitative meta-analytical approach may compensate for several of the aforementioned issues. It can attenuate the false-positive rates and the problem of sample comparability in terms of size and psychopathological variability . To further enhance comparability across the studies, current psychosis should also be an exclusion criterion being more prevalent in BD compared to MDD . In addition, psychotic mood episodes may be associated with additional brain abnormalities relative to nonpsychotic episodes and another confounding variable would have to be addressed. Finally, considering relatively indistinct diagnostic boundaries between bipolar disorder II and MDD, and metabolism  and genetic  studies suggesting a neurobiological difference between BD I and II, rather the narrow phenotype of BD I should be preferably investigated. \n\nThe uniformity of analytical methods is another challenging problem. Namely, there are only a few studies that compared depressive episodes in MDD and BD and used identical analytical methods. One way to overcome this is to focus on spatial information, e.g. brain-regions or their anatomical coordinates, of the reported differences in resting-state and include rs-fMRI studies regardless of the used analytical method . However, this still limits the inclusion process to studies that do not restrict their rs-fMRI scans and following analysis to any particular brain regions. This approach also does not provide information on the nature of these differences such as functional connectivity or revealing functional networks. Instead, it provides identification of brain regions that have a high probability to contain information relevant for distinguishing BD from MDD depression. \n\nThe present meta-analysis aims to identify converging spatial information associated with alterations in spontaneous brain activity that differentiate patients with BD and MDD depression, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) . To enhance the validity of the results, the meta-analysis focuses on whole-brain rs-fMRI studies, with currently depressed, non-psychotic BD and MDD participants. If found, identified brain regions may be targeted for testing of new hypotheses and the development of neural biomarkers for the diagnosis of BD and MDD. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe inclusion process resulted in ten eligible studies  with nine samples (two studies were performed on the same sample ) with a total of 234 BD and 296 MDD subjects. From the included studies, 7 experiments with 16 foci were extracted for the BD\u2009>\u2009MDD contrast and 6 experiments with 13 foci were extracted for the MDD\u2009>\u2009BD contrast. \n\nPooled analysis weighted by sample size of each study revealed only trend to younger age (BD: mean \u2009\u00b1\u2009SD  30.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3\u00a0years; MDD: 32.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u00a0years; t\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.64, p\u2009=\u20090.10), and lower female proportion (BD: 54.1\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9%; MDD: 61.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8%; \u03c7 \u2009=\u20093.18, p\u2009=\u20090.07), but lower severity of depression (HAMD; BD: 23.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9; MDD: 25.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2; t\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092.11, p\u2009=\u20090.03) in BD compare to MDD participants. Two studies included medication-free participants, while in two studies medication status was not specified. In remaining studies (n\u2009=\u20095; BD\u2009=\u2009150, MDD\u2009=\u2009194), comparable use of antidepressants (BD 38%, MDD 46%, p\u2009=\u20090.14), but higher rate of antipsychotics (BD 26%, MDD 4%, p\u2009\u02c2\u20090.001), lithium (BD 12%, MDD 0%, p\u2009\u02c2\u20090.001), and other mood stabilizers (BD 32%, MDD 2%, p\u2009\u02c2\u20090.001) was found in BD patients. \n\nAll included studies had an upper-medium to high quality. The summary of the studies is detailed in Table  .   \nStudies included in the meta-analysis, methods of analysis, demographics, clinical data, medication, between-group contrasts, number of foci, main study outcome and study quality. \n  \n AD   antidepressant,   ALFF   amplitude of low frequency fluctuations,   AP   antipsychotics,   BD   bipolar disorder,   Conf.   whether medication was used as a confound,   DC   degree centrality,   fALFF   fractional ALFF,   HAMD   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\u201417 items or 24 items,   Li   lithium,   MDD   major depressive disorder,   MS   mood stabilizer other than lithium,   N   number of subjects,   N\/A   information not available,   N.S.   no significant group differences,   ReHo   regional homogeneity,   SD   standard deviation. \n\n*Same sample. \n  \n\nFor the BD\u2009>\u2009MDD comparison, the ALE meta-analyses did not find any significant converging clusters (Table  ).

No increased activity was found in BD subjects compared to MDD. The main implication of this finding is that the left insula may be involved in neural activity patterns during the resting state that can be potentially used as biomarkers differentiating both disorders. \n\nIn this study, only whole-brain rs-fMRI studies unrestricted to pre-selected brain-regions with currently depressed, nonpsychotic, and BD I and MDD participants were included. This led to a drop in included studies, but also increased the overall validity of the results. Assuming the main heterogeneity of findings in included studies resulted from the variability in imaging acquisition method and statistical analyses, ALE focused on spatial convergence was found to be the best meta-analytical option for this type of study . \n\nCluster level FWE correction was applied in the meta-analysis which is regarded as the most appropriate method for statistical inference when using ALE . In individual comparative studies, CWI is considered to be prone to false positive findings . However, to use a voxel-wise inference in ALE would be too strict, especially when a rather small number of included studies was used. Therefore, to mitigate the CWI bias, in this ALE meta-analysis a recommended two-level thresholding with stricter thresholds was used . First, on the voxel-level, the forming of clusters in the ALE image was thresholded on an uncorrected p\u2009<\u20090.0001. Second, the emergent clusters were tested on a threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.05 against 5000 permutations which were generated based on the original data sets. Thus, the surviving clusters should represent a true non-random convergence across the studies. \n\nNext to the utility of the found regions as potential targets for future studies, the question arises what does the convergence of increased local activity in MDD relative to BD mean. ALE provides identification of non-random spatial convergence of included foci across the studies . Higher activity in insula in MDD relative to BD as revealed by ALE may then represent an increased local neural activity, local over-connectivity, or increased connectivity with other regions of the brain. Furthermore, an increase in MDD relative to BD may not correspond to an increase relative to healthy subjects. \n\nIn support of our findings, there is emerging evidence of increased insular activity  and connectivity  in MDD relative to BD and controls. In addition, decreased regional metabolism in medication-free BD compared to controls was found in left dorsolateral and midline brain-regions, including the insula . Moreover, while structural changes may not necessarily correspond with an increase or decrease in brain-region activity or connectivity, insular grey matter thickness was reported to be increased in MDD relative to controls , and decreased in BD  even before the onset of the illness. The decrease in grey matter volume in the insular and anterior cingulate cortex, both nodes of the salience network , was also found in first-degree relatives of BD . Reduction in gray matter volume in these structures, and potentially associated dysregulation of the salience network, may indicate an endophenotype of BD. \n\nThere are also studies that suggest opposite or mixed findings . Nevertheless, they still indicate abnormalities located in the insula and structurally or functionally adjacent brain-regions and pathways (i.e. claustrum), which displayed differences in MDD relative to BD. Taken together, there is a growing body of evidence supporting that insular activity and connectivity is increased, or at least different, in resting-state MDD relative BD (and controls). \n\nIncreased activity and connectivity in insula in MDD may be interpreted in line with current knowledge about the functional properties of the structure and clinical observations. The insula is a multimodal integration region that evaluates the emotional and motivational salience of external and internal stimuli . Typically, two functionally distinct regions are recognized in the insula . First, visceral, somatosensory, vestibular, and motor inputs are relayed to the posterior insula. From there, they are forwarded to the second part, the anterior insula, where the re-representation of these inputs is integrated with emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals collected from cortical and subcortical regions. The anterior insula together with the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala form the salience network (SN)  and is also interconnected to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum . Furthermore, the anterior insula has been entitled the \u201climbic sensory area\u201d connected with the anterior cingulate cortex, the \u201climbic motor area\u201d . In other words, the anterior insula is associated with visceral sensation, and the anterior cingulate cortex is associated with autonomic and emotional control. Lastly, the salience network has been implicated in detecting both interoceptive and external salient changes, signal for recruitment of additional processing, orient attention toward and react to salient stimuli, and switching between inward-oriented (e.g. default mode network (DMN) ) and externally directed cognition (e.g. central executive network(CEN) . \n\nFollowing this, increased activity in insula and adjacent neurocircuitry may correspond to clinical observations in which MDD patients report, among other MDD symptoms, increased introspective self-focus, rumination, and preoccupation on bodily states (somatic-muscular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and autonomic symptoms) . BD patients, on the other hand, display overall inhibition, emotional dampening, heaviness, tiredness of the body, slower thinking, inner tension, and fearfulness . In other words, MDD patients are more focused on the inside and preoccupied with self-focus on their inner world (rumination) and bodily symptoms, and BD patients are more inhibited, blunted, and fearful. \n\nFrom the perspective of functional connectivity and networks, the observed increased self-focus on inner states corresponds with the increased activity within DMN found in both MDD and BD . However, increased activity within the SN  and increased connectivity between the SN (specifically insula) and DMN was found in MDD , which suggests an increased input from visceral and bodily states in MDD. In BD, the connectivity within and from the SN seems to be impaired, suggesting a dysregulated salience associated with a dysregulation of emotional control . A recent study on the connectivity dynamics in neural networks also found that the switching rate of DMN was decreased in both MDD and BD relative to controls, suggesting an inability to navigate away from internal emotional and cognitive states . However, MDD displayed a lower switching rate in SN and striatum relative to healthy controls and BD, which corresponds with increased insular activity on one hand, and decreased regulation of DMN by SN on the other . \n\nIncreased activity in the claustrum in MDD was a rather surprising finding. No included study reported this region as differentiating the two disorders. One explanation is that claustrum was a component of larger significant clusters in the included studies, but more prominent structures nearby, such as insula or putamen, were labeled instead. Moreover, automated anatomical labelling atlases used in neuroimaging only rarely include claustrum (see AAL v3 ). And conversely, it is possible that the true finding was insula and the claustrum was the result of an oversensitive atlas used in GingerALE software. Finally, the claustrum may be a result of a false-positive convergence of overlaps of surrounding significant structures. All these notions suggest caution in the interpretation of this finding. \n\nThe claustrum is still a poorly understood structure with high connectivity in the brain . It is structurally and functionally connected with cortical and subcortical brain regions known to be compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders including the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, pre- and post-central gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and basal ganglia ; and likely acts as a relay node within several neural networks, which were proposed to be impaired in mental disorders . Still, studies on claustrum in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders are sparse and its ontogenetic origin is still debated. From the sparse available research reduced volume , hypoactivity , and reduced metabolic activity  in claustrum were reported in MDD; and reduced grey matter  and increased metabolism  was reported in BD. Currently, the claustrum is considered to belong to the insular cortex , rather than the putamen and basal ganglia . In this light, our findings suggest that distinct MDD and BD abnormalities in the claustrum are likely linked to altered insular functions and salience processing . \n\nThe study has several limitations. The first cluster of limitations is related to the analyzed populations. MDD and BD differ in several characteristics that might affect the results but are difficult to control on both, the single-study level and the meta-analysis. Aggregated data showed different gender distribution and depression severity, and even age-comparable groups do not preclude dissimilar illness duration as the younger age at onset is more prevalent in BD. However, as MDD and BD groups were comparable in age, gender, and depression severity in all included studies, the difference on the whole-sample level likely had a limited impact on the ALE results. \n\nAnother issue that should be considered is the effect of different medications in MDD and BD. Two studies enrolled non-medicated participants, another two did not specify the medication status, but in the others, a higher rate of antipsychotics, lithium, and other mood stabilizers in BD groups was indicated. Especially antipsychotics are of relevance because they have been reported to lower or normalize insular activity in psychosis . However, there are also studies showing opposite or no effect . In addition, a former review has shown that in bipolar fMRI studies, both task-based and resting state, the antipsychotic medication had no altering effect on the results . While the effect of the medication cannot be fully discarded without direct control, it is plausible to assume the lower insular activity in bipolar relative to unipolar depression is not a result of medication. \n\nThe next limitation is the small overall number of included experiments and the resulting sample sizes. This might have increased the likelihood that the ALE results were driven by a few experiments with a larger sample size . Indeed, the largest study included by Yao et al.  that represents one-fifth of the whole dataset (N\u2009=\u2009131) is one of the two main contributors to the results; the second one is the study by Liu et al. . And if either of the studies is removed from the dataset, the meta-analysis would yield no significant results. Importantly, other studies do contribute to the results as well, but the two studies are the leading contributors. Furthermore, Yao\u2019s study is the only one with a mixed BD I and II sample and besides the sample size, this might be another issue to be considered. \n\nThe ALE method has limitations as well. One limitation is that ALE takes into account only reported foci, which may omit other significant regions within the reported clusters. \n\nAnother drawback of ALE is that studies with no reported significant findings are not accounted for in the calculation. There were studies in both contrast groups (BD\u2009>\u2009MDD and MDD\u2009>\u2009BD) that indeed did not report significant findings in both directions (see Table  ). This may have led to an overestimation of the findings. \n\nThe exclusion of ROI-to-Voxel or ROI-to-ROI studies, which was justified to accommodate ALE requirements, also presents a potential bias of non-reporting of significant results. On the other hand, the risk of bias by including such studies would render the results highly unreliable. \n\nFinally, as stated above, ALE does only inform of non-random convergence of findings. This cannot fully dismiss the risk of identifying meaningless false-positive convergences (e.g. convergence in white matter, ventricles, etc.). In other words, it may pinpoint an insignificant region only because it was surrounded by true significant structures. \n\nIn conclusion, the current meta-analysis applied the ALE method to identify convergence of results of resting-state fMRI studies that compared MDD and BD currently depressed individuals. The results showed that the left insula and potentially claustrum might be involved in neural activity patterns during resting state that can be used as biomarkers differentiating both disorders. The finding is in line with clinical observations in which MDD patients display more pronounced symptoms (ruminative self-focus, focus on bodily symptoms) associated with abnormal functions of neurocircuitry involving insula and adjacent brain regions than BD patients. Future studies should confirm our findings on a larger sample, e.g. on more than ten datasets, and explore their sensitivity and specificity in differentiating both disorders. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nPrior to the study initiation, the study was pre-registered on PROSPERO ( ) with project ID CRD4201811443. The study was conducted in compliance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines for systematic review and met-analysis . \n\n### Search strategy and selection of studies \n  \nA systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases. A secondary search was conducted on the Google Scholar (GS) database. All searches were confined from January 2000 to August 2020 and performed by MP. In PubMed, WOS and Scopus titles, keywords, and abstract searches were conducted using the following terms: (bipolar OR bipolar disorder) AND (unipolar OR depression OR depressive episode OR major depressive disorder OR depressive disorder) AND (fMRI OR functional magnetic resonance) AND (rest OR resting state). In GS, a combination of the same keywords was used and the search was limited to the first 200 articles sorted by relevance. After removing duplicates, the systematic search in PubMed, WOS and Scopus identified 1508 studies. Two researchers (MP, ES) independently screened the titles, keywords, and abstracts of the studies for relevance and filtered out non-English, non-peer-reviewed, and unpublished articles. Sixty-two articles passed the initial screening of PubMed, WOS and Scopus studies and their reference lists were searched for additional potential studies with no new results. Screening of GS studies did not identify any additional articles. Two researchers (MP, ES) evaluated the full-texts of the 62 articles on the following criteria for study inclusion: (1) age of participants 18+, (2) reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach whole-brain contrasts comparing BD and MDD subjects in rs-fMRI, (3) both compared samples currently depressed, (4) moderate severity of depression when enrolled (MADRS\u2009\u2265\u200920, HAMD\u2009\u2265\u200917), (5) at least ten subjects per group. Subsequently, excluding criteria were applied: (1) reported psychiatric or neurological comorbidity, (2) study included only bipolar type II participants, (3) seasonal depression, dysthymia, (4) psychosis, (5) only task-based MRI experiments reported, (6) independent component analysis (ICA) performed and only a specific component was examined, (7) only a priori region of interest (ROI) analysis or seed-based functional connectivity analysis performed. Potential disagreements between the evaluators were to be resolved by the third author (TN). \n\nExclusion criteria 6 and 7 were based on the recommendation from BrainMap (see  ) according to which studies that intentionally restrict the image acquisition and\/or analysis to pre-selected ROI (or a specific ICA component) that is smaller than the whole brain should be excluded. Because the ALE algorithm assumes that activity in each voxel in the brain is equally likely to occur, foci from pre-selected ROIs may be reported as significant and result in an increase in false-positive rate. Studies, which were not based on BOLD (e.g. perfusion studies), were excluded as well. \n\nFrom the 62 studies, 52 were excluded after full text read. The remaining ten rs-fMRI studies used amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF)  and fractional ALFF (fALFF) , regional homogeneity (ReHo) , and degree centrality (DC) . The process is summarized in the PRISMA flowchart shown in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nPRISMA flowchart showing the process of identifying the articles included in the meta-analyses. \n  \n\n\n### Study quality assessment \n  \nIndividual study quality was assessed with a 10-point checklist (Supplementary material  ) based on previous meta-analytic studies  for the quality of the sample sizes, diagnostic procedures, demographic and clinical parameters, the fMRI acquisition parameters, analysis method, and the quality of reported results. The quality of every included paper was reviewed by two authors independently (MP, ES). Ratings were compared and inconsistencies were discussed in order to obtain a consensus score. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nFrom each included article MNI coordinates (e.g. foci) of reported peak values of significant between-group differences corrected for multiple comparisons were extracted (MP). No study used Talairach coordinates. Coordinates were assigned to two subgroups based on directionality to avoid that opposite findings across studies enhanced each other in the following analysis. The first group contained findings of increased DC, ReHo, ALFF, and fALFF in BD compared to MDD (BD\u2009>\u2009MDD). In the same manner, the second group included findings of increased resting-state measures in MDD compared to BD (MDD\u2009>\u2009BD). In each directionality subgroup, the lower n of the two samples (BD or MDD) from each study was assigned in the foci datasets, which were used in the meta-analytic calculation. The actual n of MDD and BD samples was used in calculations of heterogeneity (pooled analyses) of demographic and clinical variables across the studies. As each study may report findings in one or both directionalities and use different methods of analysis, findings in one directionality and\/or analysis were referred to, according to the convention, as experiments. Hence, any study may contain coordinates from one or more experiments. Foci from different experiments conducted on the same samples, either within one study or in different studies, were grouped together. This was the case of two studies  which compared the same MDD and BD sample, but used different analytical methods (e.g. ALFF and ReHo). Their findings for each directionality were grouped together in the main ALE meta analysis calculations and the samples were handled as one study in pooled analyses. \n\nScanning parameters of included rs-fMRI studies are available in Supplementary material  . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nGingerALE v3.02 ( ) software was used for the meta-analysis. After entry, the coordinates were masked using the conservative standard mask from GingerALE. ALE method treats each foci in a given experiment as a three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution that represents the spatial uncertainty associated with the coordinate. The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of these Gaussian functions was determined automatically by GingerALE based on the number of subjects per experiment . This accommodated the assumption that a larger sample size in an experiment provides more reliable approximations of the true activation effect and was therefore modeled by smaller Gaussian distributions and vice versa. Next, a model activation (MA) map was generated for each experiment by combining the probability distributions. To limit the cumulative effect of multiple foci close to each other within a given experiment, the non-additive approach was applied, which generated MA maps by taking the maximum probability across overlapping Gaussians . Final ALE scores were computed on a voxel-by-voxel basis by taking the union across these MA maps. The resulting ALE image was thresholded on a cluster forming threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.0001 and corrected with a family-wise error correction with cluster-level inference threshold at p\u2009<\u20090.05 and 5000 permutations . \n\nThe main ALE meta-analysis was conducted for both directionality subgroups (e.g. BD\u2009>\u2009MDD and MDD\u2009>\u2009BD). Supplementary ALE meta-analytic calculations were also conducted for each modality and directionality subgroup. Datasets with foci and ALE calculations are available at   (Open Science Framework). \n\nAll analyses were calculated in MNI space. Anatomical labels were automatically assigned by GingerALE. Visualizations were created using Mango version 3.0.4 ( ) and a high-resolution anatomical template with isotropic voxels in MNI space as distributed with GingerALE. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8379217,"text_md5":"ef4a58cdbc86cb5c1cc4a6865a7b2e64","field_positions":{"authors":[0,50],"journal":[51,58],"publication_year":[60,64],"title":[75,194],"keywords":[208,249],"abstract":[262,1721],"body":[1730,31904]},"batch":2,"pmid":34417487,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-021-96319-2","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8379217","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8379217"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8379217\">8379217<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8379217  Insula activity in resting-state differentiates bipolar from unipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis"}
{"text":"Gong, Jiaying and Wang, Junjing and Qiu, Shaojuan and Chen, Pan and Luo, Zhenye and Wang, Jurong and Huang, Li and Wang, Ying\nTransl Psychiatry, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nCommon and distinct patterns of intrinsic brain activity alterations in major depression and bipolar disorder: voxel-based meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nEpigenetics and behaviour\nBipolar disorder\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIdentification of intrinsic brain activity differences and similarities between major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) is necessary. However, results have not yet yielded consistent conclusions. A meta-analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies that explored differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) between patients (including MDD and BD) and healthy controls (HCs) was conducted using seed-based   d   mapping software. Systematic literature search identified 50 studies comparing 1399 MDD patients and 1332 HCs, and 15 studies comparing 494 BD patients and 593 HCs. MDD patients displayed increased ALFF in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), bilateral insula extending into the striatum and left supramarginal gyrus and decreased ALFF in the bilateral cerebellum, bilateral precuneus, and left occipital cortex compared with HCs. BD showed increased ALFF in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula extending into the striatum, right SFG, and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and decreased ALFF in the bilateral precuneus, left cerebellum (extending to the occipital cortex), left ACC, and left STG. In addition, MDD displayed increased ALFF in the left lingual gyrus, left ACC, bilateral precuneus\/posterior cingulate gyrus, and left STG and decreased ALFF in the right insula, right mPFC, right fusiform gyrus, and bilateral striatum relative to BD patients. Conjunction analysis showed increased ALFF in the bilateral insula, mPFC, and decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum in both disorders. Our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that MDD and BD show a common pattern of aberrant regional intrinsic brain activity which predominantly includes the insula, mPFC, and cerebellum, while the limbic system and occipital cortex may be associated with spatially distinct patterns of brain function, which provide useful insights for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in affective disorders, and developing more targeted and efficacious treatment and intervention strategies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAffective disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD, or unipolar depression) and bipolar disorder (BD), are highly prevalent and debilitating conditions associated with high suicide rates and a heavy social burden . BD is characterized by recurrent depressive and manic\/hypomanic episodes, and the depressive episodes are the most common mood manifestation of the illness . Approximately 69% of patients with BD are initially misdiagnosed with MDD, and patients meet with an average of four physicians before they are correctly diagnosed with BD , leading to inappropriate treatment, poor clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs. The identification of objective biomarkers based on neuroimaging techniques will not only facilitate more accurate differential diagnosis between the two affective disorders, but will also advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MDD and BD. \n\nNeuroimaging evidence has identified brain structural and functional alterations in multiple neuronal circuits in both MDD and BD . A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) demonstrated that common and distinct patterns of grey-matter volume changes in MDD and BD, such as the prefrontal cortex, insula, and limbic system . However, findings from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies may be confounded by differences in the experimental design of the studies and in the tasks themselves . Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) provides a noninvasive and task-free approach that removes some performance-related confounds, and provides a reliable measure of \u2018baseline\u2019 brain activity and connectivity . The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), an index to measure changes in resting-state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals, reflects cyclic modulation of gross cortical excitability and long distance neuronal synchronization . It\u2019s a relative and indirect measure of spontaneous brain activity. The current ALFF might be the most comparable measure to the resting positron emission tomography (PET). Both PET and ALFF measure the unconstrained, baseline state of mental activity. PET measures an averaged level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) or oxygen metabolism across a period of time, whereas ALFF measures the deviation, rather than the mean, of the BOLD signal . The ALFF index was found to be stable, reliable and useful in characterizing the intrinsic or spontaneous brain activity in various brain diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease , posttraumatic stress disorder , MDD , and BD . Several previous studies have employed ALFF to investigate the pathophysiology of affective disorders, and found widespread aberrant regional spontaneous brain activity, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) , precuneus\/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) , temporal gyrus , occipital gyrus , cerebellum , insula , and limbic regions . However, these results are often inconsistent, probably due to the small sample sizes, age ranges, clinical heterogeneity, and different methodology. Furthermore, it is at present unclear to what extent specific or common spontaneous brain activity alterations occur in MDD and BD given the paucity of direct comparisons. \n\nThe aim of this study was, therefore, to perform a quantitative and voxel-based meta-analysis of ALFF changes in MDD and BD, by taking advantage of the larger number of whole-brain rs-fMRI studies published in recent years. This is expected not only to enable a more precise understanding of the common and distinct pathophysiology of MDD and BD, but also to contribute to the identification of potential biomarkers for prevention and intervention in affective disorders. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources, study selection, and quality assessment \n  \nA comprehensive search of studies published between January 1st, 2000 and April 9, 2019 was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SinoMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang databases using the keywords: (1) \u201cdepression\u201d OR \u201cdepressive disorder\u201d OR \u201cmajor depression\u201d OR \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d OR \u201cdepressed\u201d OR \u201cunipolar disorder\u201d; AND \u201camplitude of low frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cALFF\u201d OR \u201clow frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cLFF\u201d OR \u201camplitude of low frequency oscillation\u201d OR \u201cLFO\u201d; (2) \u201cBipolar Disorder\u201d OR \u201cBipolar Disorders\u201d OR \u201cDisorder, Bipolar\u201d OR \u201cPsychosis, Manic-Depressive\u201d OR \u201cPsychosis, Manic Depressive\u201d OR \u201cManic-Depressive Psychosis\u201d OR \u201cManic Depressive Psychosis\u201d OR \u201cAffective Psychosis, Bipolar\u201d OR \u201cBipolar Affective Psychosis\u201d OR \u201cPsychoses, Bipolar Affective\u201d OR \u201cPsychosis, Bipolar Affective\u201d OR \u201cPsychoses, Manic-Depressive\u201d OR \u201cManic-Depressive Psychoses\u201d OR \u201cPsychoses, Manic Depressive\u201d OR \u201cMania\u201d OR \u201cManias\u201d OR \u201cManic State\u201d OR \u201cManic States\u201d OR \u201cState, Manic\u201d OR \u201cStates, Manic\u201d OR \u201cDepression, Bipolar\u201d OR \u201cBipolar Depression\u201d OR \u201cManic Disorder\u201d OR \u201cDisorder, Manic\u201d OR \u201cManic Disorders\u201d; AND \u201camplitude of low frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cALFF\u201d OR \u201clow frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cLFF\u201d OR \u201camplitude of low frequency oscillation\u201d OR \u201cLFO\u201d. In addition, the references of the included studies and relevant review articles were checked for additional relevant studies. \n\nStudies that satisfied the following conditions were included in the meta-analysis. (1) Patients had been diagnosed with BD or MDD between 18 and 60 years old; (2) ALFF comparison of patients with BD or MDD versus HCs was conducted. As we know, fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, is the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) range to that of the entire frequency range (0\u20130.25\u2009Hz). The approach of fALFF may effectively suppress non-specific signal components in the resting-state fMRI, and therefore would significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity in detecting regional spontaneous brain activity, but is not as stable as ALFF in gray matter regions . Thus, we only focused on ALFF studies in this meta-analysis. (3) Three-dimensional coordinates (Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) were reported for the whole-brain ALFF analysis. (4) Significant results were reported using thresholds for significance corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds. And (5) the study was published as an original article (not as a letter or an abstract) in a peer-reviewed English or Chinese language journal. \n\nDatasets were excluded if (1) patients with MDD\/BD diagnosed with comorbid neurological or psychiatric diseases; (2) the data were unavailable (e.g., missing neuroanatomical coordinates) even after the authors were contacted by email or telephone; (3) the data overlapped with those of another included publication; (4) a region-of-interest approach was used. \n\nWe used a 10-point checklist involved in previous meta-analysis of rs-fMRI studies to assess the quality of each study selected for this meta-analysis (Table   in Supplementary materials) . Literature search, study evaluation, and selection were independently performed by three investigators (G.J.Y., Q.S.J., and C.P.). Any discrepancies were resolved by a fourth investigator (W.Y.) for a final decision. The current study was conducted with reference to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines for the meta-analyses of observational studies . \n\n\n### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nA meta-analysis of ALFF differences between patients and HCs was conducted for MDD and BD separately using the seed-based   d   mapping (SDM) software package (version 5.15 for Windows) in a standard process ( ). The SDM approach uses effect sizes to combine reported peak coordinates that are extracted from databases with statistical parametric maps, and it recreates original maps of the effect size of ALFF difference between patients and HCs. We performed the analysis as described in the SDM tutorial and related publications and used MRIcron software ( ) to visualize SDM maps. \n\nThe SDM approach was briefly described here. We first extracted peak coordinates and effect size (e.g.,   t  -values) of differences in ALFF between patients and HCs from each dataset. A standard MNI map of the ALFF differences was then separately recreated for each dataset using an anisotropic Gaussian kernel. The mean map was finally generated by voxel-wise calculation of the random-effects mean of the dataset maps, weighted by the sample size, intra-dataset variability, and between-dataset heterogeneity. To optimally balance false positives and negatives, we used the default SDM kernel size and thresholds (full width at half maximum (FWHM)\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005, uncorrected for false discovery rate (FDR), peak height   Z  \u2009=\u20091, cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels) . It should be noted that this FWHM kernel is intended to assign indicators of proximity to reported coordinates but not to smooth any image that is different in nature. \n\nNext, a quantitative meta-analytic comparison of altered ALFF between MDD and BD was conducted by calculating differences between the two groups in each voxel and the statistical significance was determined using a standard randomization test . During this process, we included age (i.e., mean age) and sex (i.e., sex distribution) as covariates. The meta-analysis used the default kernel size and thresholds in SDM to optimize sensitivity while controlling false positives:   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 with peak height   Z  \u2009>\u20091 and a cluster extent of >10 voxels . \n\nIn addition, the overlap of ALFF-decrease\/increase between MDD and BD via conjunction of thresholded meta-analytic results-maps was investigated. To test the reliability of the overlapping approach and to provide a mean statistical significance, we performed a Monto Carlo simulation with 5000 iterations. In each iteration step, we generated two Gaussian distribution brain maps within the 20% GMV mask based on the statistical mean and standard deviation of the   t  -maps of the MDD and BD. We first conducted an FDR correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) for each of the two simulated maps and then overlapped the two maps in MNI space. Next, we determined the intersection regions and recorded the number of voxels within these regions. Finally, we compared the number of voxels in the actual interaction regions with these in the simulated data with a null distribution. \n\nIn addition, we repeated the meta-analyses above in subgroups, i.e., in unmedicated and depressed subgroup patients, respectively. We did not do the same analyses in other subgroups for their limited number of studies. \n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nFollowing preprocessing of the data, a whole-brain voxel-based jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the findings by iteratively repeating the same analysis, excluding one dataset each time . This analysis is to establish the extent to which the results could be replicated. If a brain region remained significant in all or most of (>50%) the combinations of studies, we considered the finding to be highly replicable . \n\n\n### Analysis of heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nA heterogeneity analysis was conducted using a random effects model with   Q   statistics to explore unexplained between-study variability in the results. Heterogeneous brain regions were obtained using the default SDM kernel size and thresholds (FWHM\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005, uncorrected for FDR, peak height   Z  \u2009=\u20091, cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels) . \n\nIn addition, Egger\u2019s test was performed using the Stata\/SE 12.0 software for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) to assess possible publication bias by extracting the values from statistically significant relevant peaks between patients and HCs . A   p  -value less than 0.05 was considered significant. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nMeta-regression analyses were carried out to examine the effects of clinical variables (e.g., illness duration, Hamilton depression rating scale [HAMD] score, Young mania rating scale score [YMRS]), which could potentially influence the analytic results. The results were weighted by the square root of the sample size. To minimize the reporting of spurious relationship, we selected a more conservative threshold of   p  \u2009=\u20090.0005 as used in previous studies , requiring abnormalities to be detected both in the slope and in one of the extremes of the regressor, and discarding findings in regions other than those detected in the main analyses. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies \n  \nThe first research strategy generated 737 matches. After initially removing the duplicates and reviewing the titles and abstracts, 66 studies were identified as potentially eligible for inclusion. After a detailed review of the full article text, 21 studies were excluded. Finally, 45 studies reporting 51 datasets that investigated ALFF differences between patients with MDD and HCs were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The second research strategy generated 146 matches. After initially removing the duplicates and reviewing the titles and abstracts, 16 studies were identified as potentially eligible for inclusion. After a detailed review of the full article text, 6 studies were excluded. Finally, 10 studies investigated ALFF differences between patients with BD and HCs were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Five studies compared both MDD and BD with control subjects. To sum up, we included 50 studies on MDD and 15 studies on BD. Among them, patients in 33 of 50 studies on MDD were unmedicated, and in 46 studies were in depressed state; while patients in 3 of 15 studies on BD were unmedicated, and in 6 studies were in depressed state.

No significant differences were observed between patients with MDD and HCs with respect to age (standardized mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u2009\u223c0; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u2009\u22124.222 to 4.976,   t  \u2009=\u20090.163,   p  \u2009=\u20090.871) or sex distribution (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20092.104,   p  \u2009=\u20090.154). The mean score from the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) was 23.1. \n\n\n#### BD \n  \nThe included datasets reported ALFF differences between 494 patients with BD (243 males and 251 females; mean age\u2009=\u200929.2 years; mean illness duration\u2009=\u200936.8 months) and 593 HCs (270 males and 323 females; mean age\u2009=\u200929.8 years). Of the 494 patients, 210 (42.5%) were depressed at the time of scanning, 73 (14.8%) were euthymic, 58 (11.7%) were manic, 3 (0.6%) were mixed, and 1 (0.2%) was hypomanic; mood state was not available for 149 patients (30.2%). In relation to bipolar subtypes, 95 patients were type I and 128 patients were type II; the subtype was not available in 271 patients. No significant differences were observed between patients with BD and HCs with respect to age (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u223c0; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22124.314 to 3.200,   t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.305,   p  \u2009=\u20090.763) or sex distribution (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20093.563,   p  \u2009=\u20090.066). The mean score from the HAMD was 16.4 and mean YMRS score was 9.6. \n\n\n#### MDD versus BD \n  \nMDD and BD patients were not similar with respect to sex (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20099.566,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) and mean age (  t  \u2009=\u20092.545,   p  \u2009=\u20090.013). Duration of illness was greater in BD (36.8 months vs. 11.9 months,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Predictably, the proportion of depressed patients was higher in the MDD group (92% vs. 43%). \n\nThe demographic, clinical, imaging characteristics, and quality scores of the included studies in this meta-analysis were well described in Table   in supplementary materials. \n\n\n\n### ALFF differences of the main meta-analysis \n  \n#### MDD versus HCs \n  \nAs illustrated in Fig.  , the meta-analytic brain map showed both decreased and increased ALFF in MDD patients relative to HCs. Patients with MDD displayed increased ALFF in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, mPFC, and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), bilateral insula extending into the striatum, and left supramarginal gyrus, and decreased ALFF in the bilateral posterior lobes of cerebellum, bilateral precuneus, and left occipital cortex compared with HCs. These areas did not show significant between-study heterogeneity (all   p   values\u2009>\u20090.05). Egger\u2019s tests of publication bias were nonsignificant except in the left cerebellum and occipital gyrus (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). A jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that in MDD patients, the most robust data were obtained for increases in ALFF in the right SFG, left insula, and left supramarginal gyrus and decreases in ALFF in the bilateral cerebellum, and left precuneus, replicable in all 56 datasets. The increased ALFF in the right insula and decreased ALFF in the left occipital gyrus and right precuneus remained replicable, as they were significant in at least 54\/56 of the datasets. The results from the SDM analysis were summarized in Table  .    Brain regions showed significant ALFF differences between groups based on the meta-analyses.  \nMeta-analyses results regarding   a   ALFF difference between MDD and HCs,   b   ALFF difference BD and HCs,   c   ALFF difference between MDD and BD (vs. HCs), as well as   d   conjunction of MDD and BD (vs. HCs).

Patients with BD displayed increased ALFF in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (including the orbital prefrontal cortex), bilateral insula extending into the striatum, right SFG (including the mPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and right temporal pole, and decreased ALFF in the left posterior lobes of cerebellum (extending to the occipital cortex), bilateral precuneus, left ACC, and left superior temporal gyrus (STG). These areas did not show significant between-study heterogeneity except the right mPFC (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). Egger\u2019s tests of publication bias were nonsignificant (all   p   values\u2009>\u20090.05). A jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that in BD patients, the most robust data were obtained for increases in ALFF in the right IFG, left insula, right SFG (orbital prefrontal gyrus), and right occipital gyrus and decreases in ALFF in the left cerebellum, and right precuneus, replicable in all 15 datasets. The increased ALFF in the left IFG, and right SFG (orbital part) and decreased ALFF in the left ACC and left STG remained replicable, as they were significant in at least 12\/15 of the datasets (Table  ). \n\n\n#### (MDD vs. HCs) versus (BD vs. HCs) \n  \nAs illustrated in Fig.  , the meta-analytic brain map showed both decreased and increased ALFF in MDD patients relative to BD patients. MDD displayed increased ALFF in the left lingual gyrus, left ACC, bilateral precuneus\/PCC, and left STG, and decreased ALFF in the right insula, right mPFC, right fusiform gyrus, and bilateral striatum relative to BD patients (Table  ). \n\n\n#### (MDD vs. HCs) and (BD vs. HCs) conjunction \n  \nAs illustrated in Fig.  , the conjunction analysis revealed that both MDD and BD had increased ALFF in bilateral insula, mPFC, and decreased ALFF in the left posterior lobe of cerebellum. \n\n\n#### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nIn patients with MDD, meta-regression analysis indicated that higher HAMD score was correlated with greater increases in ALFF in the right ACC. In patients with BD, meta-regression analysis revealed that higher HAMD score exhibited larger decreases in ALFF in the right PCC. Mean illness duration was not associated with any MDD or BD-related ALFF changes. The results of the meta-regression analyses were presented in Table  .   \nResults of meta-regression analyses for MDD and BD. \n  \n MDD   major depressive disorder,   BD   bipolar disorder,   HAMD   Hamilton depression scale,   YMRS   Young Manic Rating Scale,   BA   Brodmann area,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute,   SDM   seed-based d mapping. \n  \n\nIn addition, the results for meta-analyses on unmedicated subgroups were provided in Fig. S  and Table  , while the results on depressed subgroups were provided in Fig. S  and Table   in the Supplementary materials. The main results remained largely unchanged. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this paper, we report findings from the largest voxel-based meta-analysis conducted to date of ALFF studies in MDD and BD. We compared results to identify both common and different patterns of spontaneous brain activity alterations. MDD and BD shared increased ALFF in the bilateral insula and right mPFC, and decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum posterior lobe, suggesting that altered intrinsic activity in these regions is common to both disorders. Several regions, including the limbic system and occipital cortex, differed between conditions, indicating that these disorders may be associated with spatially distinct patterns of brain function. \n\nThe insula is a cortical structure with extensive connections to many areas of the cortex and limbic system, which implicated in disparate cognitive, affective, and regulatory functions, including interoceptive awareness, emotional responses, and empathic processes . We found increased ALFF in the bilateral insula (extending into the striatum) in MDD and BD, suggesting a consistently abnormal pattern of intrinsic activity in both disorders. Furthermore, increasing ALFF of the right insula was significantly greater in BD than MDD. A recent multimodal meta-analysis  noted increased ALFF and regional CBF (rCBF) in the left insula in MDD. Of note, this meta-analysis included eight ALFF studies and eight rCBF studies. More recently, several rs-fMRI studies found altered functional connectivity between the insula-centric salience network (SN) and the default mode network (DMN), and the central executive network (CEN) in MDD and BD . The insula-mediated dynamic switching between the DMN and the CEN facilitates access to cognitive resources, such as attention and working memory, when a salient event is detected. Thus, altered strength in the connectivity in these networks affects cognitive deficits in some cases of affective disorders . Previous task-based fMRI studies found abnormal activity of the insula during executive functioning tasks and emotional processing tasks in MDD  and BD , which may partly explain the difficulties in cognitive and emotional integration in affective disorders. Moreover, changes in insula activity occur with a variety of treatments for depression, including medication, deep brain stimulation, and cognitive behavior therapy, suggesting a role for this region in mediating antidepressant response and remission more generally . Several meta-analysis of structural morphometric studies also found reduced grey-matter volume in the bilateral insula in MDD and BD . Thus, functional and structural abnormality of the insula may be a key neurobiological feature of affective disorders. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex is considered as a key neuronal region in regulating attention, cognitive control, motivation, and emotion . We found increased ALFF in the prefrontal cortex in MDD and BD. In MDD, these alterations were predominantly located in the most bilateral SFG, including the mPFC, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and ACC, while in BD these alterations were located in the bilateral IFG (including the orbital prefrontal cortex) and right SFG (including the mPFC and dorsolateral PFC). The conjunction analysis indicated that ALFF of the right mPFC was robustly higher in both conditions, suggesting a consistent intrinsic activity abnormal pattern across disorders. A recent meta-analysis confirmed the association between rumination and DMN core regions- the mPFC subsystem activation. Based on those findings, they suggested a hypothesis of how DMN regions support rumination and presented the implications of this model for treating MDD characterized by rumination . Several studies showed that people who engaged in ruminative responses to depressive symptoms had higher levels of depressive symptoms over time, after accounting for baseline levels of depressive symptoms . Another meta-analysis of VBM study reported that both MDD and BD shared similar patterns of lower grey-matter volume in the mPFC . These findings of the mPFC, in conjunction with increased ALFF in the bilateral insula findings, suggest the increased intrinsic activity of the mPFC and insula could be a compensatory response to structural deficits in both MDD and BD. Several proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS) studies found abnormal levels of glutamate\u2009+\u2009glutamine (Glx) within the prefrontal cortex in MDD  and BD . Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. A combined fMRI-MRS study found glutamate concentration in the mPFC correlated with the ALFF in the same area of the MDD patients, suggesting a unique functional-metabolic coupling . Glutamate could coordinate both the vascular and metabolic responses to neuronal activity underlying functional imaging signal changes . Post-mortem studies also noted increased levels of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex of both MDD and BD , suggesting a perturbed frontal glutamate system. Taken together, these observed changes of the prefrontal cortex possibly lead to abnormalities in cognition, behavior, and emotion in affective disorders. \n\nWe found decreased ALFF in the left posterior lobes of cerebellum (mainly in lobule VI and crus I) in MDD and BD, and decreased ALFF in the right posterior lobes of cerebellum (mainly in lobule VI) in MDD, suggesting disrupted intrinsic activity of the posterior cerebellum in both disorders. A previous meta-analysis of eight ALFF studies demonstrated decreased ALFF in the cerebellum in medication na\u00efve patients with MDD . The anterior hemisphere of the cerebellum is regarded as being primarily related to motor learning and coordination while the posterior lobe is involved in emotion, awareness, and cognitive processing of higher-order functions in humans . There is increasing evidence that the cerebellum is connected to cortical areas involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders . Abnormal structure and function in the cerebellum (especially in the cerebellar posterior lobules VI, VIIa (Crus I), IX, and in the posterior area of the vermis)  have been reported in both BD and MDD patients, including abnormalities of gray matter volume , glucose metabolism , functional activity, and connectivity . Moreover, dysregulation between the limbic cerebellum and the well-known limbic cerebral networks consequent to a cerebellar lesion is at the root of BD, at least the manic state, and provides a new framework for interpreting cerebellar modulation in the regulation of mood in specific psychiatric conditions . Cerebellar dysfunction might slow the data integration necessary for mood state awareness, resulting in difficulty of depressed cerebellar damage patients in explicitly recognizing their mood . Therefore, our findings provide additional evidence for the involvement of cerebellar dysfunction in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. \n\nIn addition, we found decreased ALFF in the left occipital cortex in MDD and decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum (extending to the occipital cortex) in BD. Furthermore, BD showed lower ALFF in the left lingual gyrus than MDD. The occipital lobe contains most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex and contributes to visual information processing and communication with the cerebral cortex, and plays a role in the perception of facial emotion . Few studies have reported the occipital lobe changes in mood disorders. However, some studies found structural , functional , and metabolic  abnormalities in the occipital cortex in MDD and BD. Moreover, several researches considered the model of selective bias in processing and interpretation for emotional information to be one of the risk factors of MDD for young people and that attention to negative information may maintain depression . Taken together, these findings of disrupted intrinsic activity in the occipital cortex suggest that processing bias in affective disorders may be initiated as a perceptual visual bias, which may cause a series of cognitive and affective symptoms. \n\nMDD and BD showed different ALFF changes, most prominently in the left ACC, left occipital cortex, right PCC, right insula and right medial orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore, our findings of increased ALFF in the ACC are specific to MDD, and decreased ALFF in the PCC\/ precuneus is specific to BD, suggesting that a differential pattern of intrinsic activity in the limbic system may potentially differentiate these two disorders. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that higher HAMD scores were associated with greater increase of ALFF in the ACC in MDD, and were associated with greater decrease of ALFF in the PCC in BD. Therefore, altered intrinsic activity of the cingulate cortex is very likely a state effect. The cingulate cortex is an important interface between emotional regulation, sensing and action. Previous task-based fMRI studies found abnormal ACC activation during the facial emotional processing  and executive control paradigm  in MDD but not in BD, potentially indicating different pathophysiologic processes, especially in emotion regulation and attentional control neural circuitry in MDD versus BD . In addition, activation patterns in the ACC, especially the subgenual ACC, have been shown to successfully predict treatment response for antidepressant medication and electroconvulsive therapy . However, several studies found decreased glial density , gray matter volume , and cortical thickness  in the ACC in MDD and BD. The relationship between functional and structural alterations in these conditions remains unclear; and further research is essential to understand potential functional and\/or structural disease-specific alterations within affective disorders in the limbic system. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis meta-analysis had some limitations. First, we could not determine whether these functional alterations were part of the pathogenesis or a consequence of these disorders because of the nature of cross-sectional studies. Second, the samples used in the studies differed between disorders with respect to treatment status. Given that psychotropic medications can have effects on brain function, it is difficult to be certain that results are not entirely independent from medication status. However, because the subgroup analysis of drug-naive MDD patients yielded similar findings as data from the whole group analysis (Fig. S  and Table  ), the effects we observed to seem most likely to be illness related rather than treatment-related. A further limitation is the difference in mood states of MDD and BD patients. The majority of patients with MDD were currently depressed at the time of scanning, while the majority of BD participants were euthymic or depressed, and the limited number of studies in each category prevented statistical analysis of mood state effects. Third, clinical details were often insufficiently reported in the studies for comprehensive and powerful subgroup or meta regression analyses. Including a range of clinical variables in future neuroimaging studies would benefit future meta analyses greatly. Relevant clinical information could include bipolar subtype (e.g., I\/II), mental state at the time of scanning (e.g., depressive, manic, and euthymic phase), rating scale scores, medication status, type of medication administered (e.g., antidepressant, mood stabilizer and antipsychotics), and duration of administration, details of comorbidities, age of onset\/duration of illness, and number of episodes. Finally, age and sex were significantly different between MDD and BD patients in this study. But we included age and sex as covariates in conducting a quantitative meta-analytic comparison of altered ALFF between MDD and BD. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, the current meta-analysis demonstrates that MDD and BD show a common pattern of aberrant regional intrinsic brain activity, which predominantly includes the insula, mPFC, and cerebellum. In addition, the two conditions also show distinct patterns of brain activity alterations in the limbic system regions (particularly in the cingulate cortex) and occipital cortex. These findings seem to imply that MDD and BD have more brain functionally similar than they are different. These results expand on a growing literature exploring resting-state activity in MDD and BD, which provide useful insights for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in affective disorders, and developing more targeted and efficacious treatment and intervention strategies. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7573621,"text_md5":"181a9fb6e3bd2598bb2464fcf76a6b82","field_positions":{"authors":[0,125],"journal":[126,143],"publication_year":[145,149],"title":[160,296],"keywords":[310,353],"abstract":[366,2574],"body":[2583,36433]},"batch":2,"pmid":33077728,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-020-01036-5","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7573621","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7573621"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7573621\">7573621<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7573621  Common and distinct patterns of intrinsic brain activity alterations in major depression and bipolar disorder: voxel-based meta-analysis"}

We identified over 200 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies via NeuroSynth that met our inclusion criteria and fell within bilateral Crus II areas related to \u2018sequencing\u2019 during mentalizing (coordinates\u2009\u00b124\u2009\u221276\u2009\u221240; from earlier studies) and mere social \u2018mentalizing\u2019 or self-related emotional cognition (coordinates\u2009\u00b126\u2009\u221284\u2009\u221234; from NeuroSynth), located in the cerebellar mentalizing network. A large majority of these studies (74%) involved mentalizing or self-related emotional cognition. Other functions formed small minorities. This high incidence in Crus II compares very favorably against the lower base rate for mentalizing and self-related emotions (around 35%) across the whole brain as revealed in NeuroSynth. In contrast, there was much less support for a similar role of Crus I (coordinates\u2009\u221240\u2009\u221270\u2009\u221240 from earlier \u2018sequencing\u2019 studies) as only 35% of the studies were related to mentalizing or self-related emotions. The present findings show that a domain-specific social mentalizing functionality is supported in the cerebellar Crus II. This has important implications for theories of the social cerebellum focusing on sequencing of social actions, and for cerebellar neurostimulation treatments. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFor a long time, it was believed that the cerebellum is exclusively involved in motor control. During the last decades, however, a paradigmatic shift took place supported by empirical evidence, indicating that the cerebellum also supports non-motor mental functions ( ), especially in the posterior lobe, which is evolutionary younger ( ). Even more recently, accumulating evidence suggests that the posterior cerebellum also supports social cognition ( ,  ). Social cognition is the process of perceiving and interpreting the behavior and state of mind of people, including the self ( ;  ;  ). One of the most advanced human social cognitive functions involves interpreting a person\u2019s mind, termed \u2018mentalizing\u2019. It requires insight in the mental state of another person or the self, ranging from understanding concrete here-and-now intentions, causes, emotions and beliefs, to abstract social inferences in terms of personality traits ( ;  ;  ;  ), past or future autobiographic events ( ;  ;  ), as well as hypothetical thoughts ( ). Distortions in mentalizing are considered to cause anomalies in social and affective functioning, such as in autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia and pre-frontal syndromes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAlthough neuroimaging studies on mentalizing focused mainly on the cerebral cortex, more specifically the mentalizing\/default network ( ;  ;  ;  ), a seminal meta-analysis by Van Overwalle and colleagues ( ,  ) provided novel evidence that mentalizing processes are also sub-served by the posterior cerebellum, which is part of the mentalizing\/default network of the cerebellum ( ). Mentalizing should be distinguished from mirroring, which refers to social understanding by directly observing human bodily motion (of limbs, arms, hands, etc.). In mirroring, social understanding is limited to inferring the goal of human biological movement by direct matching to a representation in one\u2019s memory of own actions and their goals ( ;  ;  ;  ). Mirroring is supported by the mirror network, a part of the sensorimotor network located in the cerebrum ( ) and anterior cerebellum ( ), which falls beyond the scope of the present meta-analysis. \n\n### Mentalizing in the posterior cerebellum \n  \nAlthough consensus is growing that mentalizing is sub-served by the posterior cerebellum ( ,  ,  ), it is unclear whether this process is unique and specialized in some areas in the posterior cerebellum. Are some areas in the posterior cerebellum uniquely activated during this mentalizing process, or are many other processes sub-served? If specific areas in the posterior cerebellum are preferentially engaged in mentalizing, which mentalizing functions are mostly supported? The aim of this paper is to address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of cerebellar areas that are involved in social mentalizing and other functions. For this, we use a somewhat unusual strategy: Instead of screening all social studies and looking up which cerebellar areas are activated, we turn this classic procedure upside down and select specific areas known to be strongly involved in social cognition, and look at all the studies, irrespective of domain, that reported activation in these areas. This is novel, because previous meta-analyses demonstrated only that the cerebellum played a role in social cognition, but did not focus on the relative contribution of the posterior cerebellum during social cognition and mentalizing in particular, or on specific mentalizing functions that it may underlie. \n\nThere is indeed evidence revealing that the posterior cerebellum might not be preferentially engaged for social cognition after all. An early functional meta-analysis of the cerebellum ( ;  ) did not report social functions, but pointed to a plethora of other non-social processes that the cerebellum might support. These involved, apart from the classic function of motor perception and execution, other cognitive functions such as semantics, language and executive control. The meta-analysis by Van Overwalle and his team ( ,  ) provided evidence that mentalizing is sub-served by the posterior cerebellum, but did not investigate how unique this process is. A recent meta-analysis ( ) provided evidence for social cognition in the cerebellum, but the task was limited to the perception of biological motion of geometric shapes, which is not very representative of human social mentalizing. Recent studies with cerebellar patients documented dysfunctions in lower and higher levels of mentalizing, but did not relate each dysfunction with specific cerebellar areas ( ;  ). In sum, although earlier work demonstrated that the cerebellum is involved in social cognition, it did not address the question of how unique this involvement is in comparison with other psychological processes, nor did it compare systematically which distinct mentalizing processes are supported by the cerebellum. \n\n\n### Social action sequences in the posterior cerebellum \n  \nTo answer these questions, it is instructive to briefly review recent developments on the theoretical role that the cerebellum might play during mentalizing. There is general agreement that the main function of the cerebellum involves motor implementation, monitoring and automatization, through the construction of implicit internal models of motor behavior and its anticipated somatosensory consequences. It has been suggested that during evolution, a more advanced function developed whereby the cerebellum constructs internal models of pure mental processes in the form of event sequences, without involvement of overt movements and somatosensory responses ( ;  ;  ). This learning and automatization of action sequences in internal cerebellar models allow to send out immediate error signals when unexpected events or environmental changes occur. Applied to social cognition, this evolutionary recent function may support intuitive social understanding of human action and facilitate corrective insight and adaptation to novel social circumstances ( ;  ). Internal cerebellar models may also allow humans to plan actions in advance and to engage in social interaction, by anticipating various potential sequences of responses of other agents and alternative ways to reach one\u2019s goal. In support of this view, several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity studies confirmed that there are strong links between the posterior cerebellum and key mentalizing areas in the cerebral cortex, such as the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the medial frontal cortex (mPFC) ( ,  ,  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIf these theoretical claims are correct, then mentalizing might engage the cerebellum most strongly when predicting an appropriate sequence of social actions that require the understanding of an agent\u2019s mental state. A key aspect of mentalizing is that observers should be able to understand another person\u2019s belief even when that belief contradicts reality. This aspect is investigated during false belief tasks: unbeknownst by a protagonist, an object is displaced and the critical question is where the protagonist will look for the object (e.g. upon his or her return). To illustrate, if Anne removes Sally\u2019s candy from a basket to a box during Sally\u2019s absence, where will Sally look for her candy when she returns? It takes children up to about 4 years before they can adequately respond to this task by pointing to the original location of the object (where the protagonist Sally saw it last: the basket) rather than where the object is currently located (the box). The original location (involving the correct response) is termed \u2018false\u2019 because it refers to a situation that does not reflect the current \u2018true\u2019 location. \n\nIn a recent pilot study ( ), patients with generalized cerebellar lesions showed the greatest impairments compared to healthy control participants when they had to generate the correct order of four cartoon-like pictures that required the understanding of false beliefs. There were no significant impairments for generating the correct order of routine events that involved mechanical sequences (e.g. a car hitting a rock, then hitting and breaking a tree downhill) or social scripts (e.g. going to the groceries by entering the building, picking items, paying, saying bye and leaving). This seems to indicate that a key social function of the cerebellum involves the correct sequencing of social actions that require the understanding of mental states. A follow-up fMRI study involving healthy subjects ( ) also employed this picture sequencing task, and extended it with true beliefs stories (which only require an understanding of another person\u2019s beliefs that coincide with reality) and with a similar verbal version of the task. The results showed that both false and true belief stories in both, pictorial and verbal task versions, engaged the bilateral posterior cerebellum more than non-social mechanical stories. The cerebellar areas recruited during this study are the starting point of our meta-analysis, as discussed below. \n\n\n### Regions of interest and hypotheses \n  \nTo test the mentalizing role of the posterior cerebellum, we queried the NeuroSynth database (neurosynth.org) for all studies that fell within pre-designated regions of interest (ROIs), and categorized all studies for their mentalizing and non-mentalizing functionality. \n\nTo isolate ROIs specialized for mentalizing in the posterior cerebellum, we started from recent fMRI studies that investigated a key aspect of cerebellar mentalizing: generating the correct sequence of social events that require the understanding of a person\u2019s beliefs. In the study by   previously mentioned, a contrast involving sequencing of true and false belief stories against non-social mechanical stories (including pictorial and verbal stories; total n\u2009=\u200973) revealed activation in the right posterior cerebellum Crus II with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates 25\u2009\u221275\u2009\u221240 (see also  ). Exactly the same right Crus II ROI was also identified in an earlier connectivity study by   ( ; see also  ) that pooled 5 studies (total n\u2009=\u200991) investigating the role of the cerebellum in abstract social reasoning, including person trait inferences and hypothetical counterfactuals. \n\nGiven this evidence, we defined this right Crus II peak as our primary ROI 1 together with its left mirror location (ROI 2), and denoted these as \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs given their potential role during social action sequencing (see Figure  ). Note that these two \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs are clearly located within the mentalizing network demarcated by  . They are also quite close to two lateral Crus II cluster peaks reported in a recent meta-analysis by   ( ;\u2009\u221224\u2009\u221279\u2009\u221236; 20\u2009\u221278\u2009\u221234; about 6\u20138 mm away). \n  \nRegions of interest and results of the meta-analysis for the \u2018Mentalizing\u2019 and \u2018Emotional self-experiences\u2019 Task (sub)categories (the remaining task categories are indicated by white bars). ROIs taken from a top view (z\u2009=\u2009\u221240;\u2009\u221234) and a back view (y\u2009=\u2009\u221275;\u2009\u221270;\u2009\u221284). The sequencing ROIs 1, 2 and 5 are superimposed on the parcellation of 7 networks from Bruckner et al. (2011), where the white area reflects the mentalizing\/default network, and the neighboring light grey area the executive network. The mentalizing ROIs 3 and 4 are taken from NeuroSynth. ROIs 1\u20134 are in Crus II, ROI 1 with MNI coordinates 25\u2009\u221275\u2009\u221240 ( ; Van Overwalle   et al.  ,  ), ROI 2 as it is the left counterpart with MNI coordinates\u2009\u221225\u2009\u221275\u2009\u221240, ROIs 3 and 4 with MNI coordinates\u2009\u00b126\u2009\u221284\u2009\u221234 from the mentalizing (topic 8 and 28) meta-analysis in NeuroSynth. ROI 5 is in the right Crus I with MNI coordinates\u2009\u221240\u2009\u221270\u2009\u221240 (Van Overwalle   et al.  ,  ). \n  \nIn addition, we derived two bilateral Crus II ROIs from the automated social \u2018mentalizing\u2019 meta-analyses in NeuroSynth (ROIs 3 and 4 with MNI coordinates\u2009\u00b126\u2009\u221284\u2009\u221234, extracted from the 50 topics set in the NeuroSynth database as of July 2018 (topic #8 and #28, which contains 1054 and 951 studies respectively;  ; for more details, see  ). Other extractions that include \u2018mentalizing\u2019 as keyword were also available, such as from the 100 topics set (topic #071, which contains 688 studies) and the 200 topics set (topic #145, which contains 478 studies). Although these sets are arguably more precise, they nevertheless contain fewer studies that might be relevant (e.g. topic #071 from the 100 topics set included the top-loading term \u2018non-verbal\u2019 and excluded some studies using exclusively verbal material). Moreover, the selected coordinates for ROIs 3 and 4 fall right in the clusters of these alternative topics sets. It is interesting to note that the 200 topics set has two topics that include \u2018mentalizing\u2019 as a keyword, one with mentalizing as main topic (#145) identified before and which shows robust cerebellar activity, while the other (#154) involves predominantly social interaction and shows essentially no cerebellar activity. \n\nBecause we will use the NeuroSynth database also for identifying studies of interest for our meta-analysis, it might seem that taking these \u2018mentalizing\u2019 ROIs 3 and 4 from the same database results in a sort of double dipping. Nonetheless, an independent analysis of their underlying functions is important because it is still unclear which mentalizing and non-mentalizing functions might be related to these two \u2018mentalizing\u2019 ROIs 3 and 4, and to what extent these are similar to the other \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs 1 and 2. Moreover, as we will see later, many studies reporting coordinates in ROIs 3 and 4 do not involve task activations, but indirect neural measures such as connectivity, volume and so on. These are only remotely related to mentalizing processes, and therefore were eliminated from our analysis. Consequently, the present analysis of ROIs 3 and 4 might be considered as an additional validation and deeper scrutiny of the automated NeuroSynth meta-analysis; it will be interesting to learn whether the automated NeuroSynth topical meta-analyses for mentalizing make sense or not. \n\nWe hypothesize that these four ROIs are most likely specialized for mentalizing (including emotional self-experience as they refer to mentalizing about the self). If this prediction is correct, we expect a great majority of mentalizing functions to be recruited by these posterior cerebellar areas, in comparison with non-mentalizing functions and in comparison with the base rate of mentalizing functions across the whole brain in the NeuroSynth database. Given the evolutionary role of the cerebellum in motion, we further predict that within the mentalizing functions, the following input material will recruit our ROIs most prominently: observed or verbally described human movements or actions (e.g. facial and bodily expressions; visual information on human actions), which induce mental inferences (e.g. on other\u2019s emotional states and true or false beliefs), and perhaps also remembered or imagined human actions (e.g. autobiographic memories), based on the assumption that even (static) pictures and verbal descriptions may easily generate notions of dynamic action. In contrast, other input such as the mere physical presence of humans or judgments without any sequence of events will recruit our ROIs less likely, such as trait judgments based on trait adjectives (i.e. they imply past actions but do not directly refer to a sequence of actions). \n\nFinally, from the study mentioned earlier by   on sequencing true and false belief stories, another peak was identified using the same procedure involving a contrast of true and false belief stories against non-social mechanical stories, in the left posterior cerebellum Crus I located somewhat more peripherally with MNI coordinates\u2009\u221240\u2009\u221270\u2009\u221240 (see also  ). This peak served as ROI 5. To the extent that ROI 5 is very close to the executive network ( ) as can be observed in Figure  , it might reveal relatively less empirical support for mentalizing functionality, and as such may serve as a sort of baseline to estimate the relative contribution of mentalizing reasoning in the posterior cerebellum in more general. \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Selection of studies \n  \nThe fMRI studies reviewed in the current meta-analysis were taken from the NeuroSynth database (neurosynth.org). A study was defined as a single fMRI experiment, and all coordinates from all task-related analyses in each study were eligible (in\u00a0the same manner as in NeuroSynth). No attempt was made to include studies from other databases, because as far as we are aware, NeuroSynth is currently the only one that allows to select studies on the basis of pre-defined ROIs. An overview of the identification of studies, their screening and eligibility is given in Figure  .\n \n  \nPrisma diagram of the meta-analysis on Mentalizing and Emotional self-experiences. \n  \nAs detailed in the introduction, we selected five ROIs in the posterior cerebellum that were related to mentalizing (Figure  ). Note that for the right \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROI 1, the data from   were pooled across pictorial and verbal sequencing tasks. A contrast comparing sequencing of true and false belief stories against non-social mechanical stories (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE-corrected) resulted in a cluster peak with MNI coordinates 25\u2009\u221275\u2009\u221240 after rounding to the next 5 mm, and which matched exactly with the ROI of  . Afterward, in NeuroSynth, the MNI coordinates of the right and left \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs were automatically rounded to even values\u2009\u00b124\u2009\u221276\u2009\u221240.\n \n\nWe identified all studies in NeuroSynth within a radius of 6 mm around the coordinates of all five ROIs. From these, we selected studies that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: \n  \nMRI studies that reported functional results. Consequently, MRI studies involving only resting state or connectivity analyses, structural or volumetric measurements, an independent or principal component analysis, or coupled with EEG measurements, were excluded. PET studies were also excluded. \n  \nfMRI results expressed in MNI template ( ) to make sure that the reported peaks fell within the 6 mm radius. Studies with Talairach coordinates ( ) were excluded because, contrary to the claim on the NeuroSynth website, more often than not, Talairach coordinates were not converted to MNI coordinates. In addition, converting coordinates from Talairach to MNI might be potentially very biased for the cerebellum, because this area is the furthest away from the zero brain coordinates. Moreover, fMRI studies with incorrectly reported coordinates in NeuroSynth or in the original study (i.e. not located within the anatomical area indicated) were also excluded, since they did not fell within the 6 mm radius. \n  \nfMRI results that involved unmedicated healthy participants, either adults or adolescents (i.e.\u2009>\u200910 years old, see also Van Overwalle   et al.  ,  ). Clinical studies were included if they reported the separate and independent results of healthy control participants. In contrast, studies with children (<10 years old) or fMRI coordinates resulting from statistical interactions with patients, medication, a chemical substance or genetic measurements were excluded. \n  \nfMRI studies that involved a comparison against an adequate control condition or a parametric regression analysis. This excluded, for instance, comparisons between left and right hemispheres ( ) and fMRI coordinates that showed more activation during a control rest condition than an experimental condition (e.g.  ;  ), except when predicted (e.g.  ). \n  \nfMRI coordinates from empirical findings for the whole (sub)sample. Consequently, coordinates from individual participants were excluded, as well as from meta-analyses and review studies. \n  \nOf the more than 400 studies initially identified, these criteria led to the inclusion of 207 (49%) valid studies in total. Table   lists the criteria for exclusion and the number of studies involved (see also  ), as well as some study\/demographic variables of the included studies (i.e. gender, age and sample size without participants excluded from the analysis). A chi-square test revealed that none of the ROIs showed an unequal distribution of the exclusion criteria (relative to the total number of studies excluded in each ROI),   P  \u2009>\u20090.99. \n  \nCriteria and number of excluded studies; demographics of included studies \n  \nA chi-square test revealed that none of the ROIs showed an unequal distribution of the exclusion criteria,   P  \u2009>\u20090.08. SPECT = Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography; EEG = Electro-encefalography \n  \nNote that some studies were identified for more than one ROI. This is due to the fact that the centers of the ROIs are only 11 mm apart and the 6 mm radius in each ROI thus causes some overlap. To illustrate, several studies appear in multiple ROIs with different coordinates (e.g.  , appears in ROI 2, ROI 4 and ROI 5;  , appears in ROI 3 and ROI 4;  , appears in ROI 3 and ROI 4;  , appears in ROI 3 and ROI 4;  , appears in ROI 1 and ROI 2) or with the same set of coordinates (e.g.   appears in ROI 1 and ROI 3). \n\n\n### Classification of studies \n  \nNext, we identified several task categories that were most similar among a set of studies. The classification of each study into a task category was determined by the description of task, stimuli of the main condition (in the contrast or regression), instructions and contrast between experimental and control conditions, using similar criteria as in earlier meta-analyses by Van Overwalle and colleagues ( ;  ;  ) and  ; see Table   for some examples, Supplementary Table S1 for more details). \n\nThe criteria for mentalizing, as well as for non-mentalizing functions, were detailed as follows: \n  \nExamples of studies for all major task and mentalizing categories \n  \nH\u2009=\u2009Percentage of human or humanized animals in the stimulus material based on the information provided (source indicated by subscript). \n    \n Mentalizing  : First, we excluded (visually) observed limb (e.g. hand, arm, leg) movements because this may induce goal inferences based solely on social \u2018mirroring\u2019 processes, which do not require mentalizing. Second, in line with the task categories specified by   and other meta-analyses listed above, and based on the stimulus material of the main condition and the statistical analysis (i.e. contrast or parametric modulation), we identified mentalizing through a number of content sub-categories. These sub-categories are listed below, loosely ranged from concrete (i.e. here and now) to abstract in the line of  . If more than one content sub-category was possible, we indicated in the   the higher level of abstraction: \n  \n Social Meaning   involves comprehension of human actions and narratives, minimally about the goal-direction of the action, without being asked explicitly about the specific mental state of the agent (e.g. X goes to the movies;  ). This is based on the assumption that understanding \u2018rational actions \u2026 requires attributing intentions to the protagonist of a story\u2019 ( , p. 19). There is a wealth of behavioral and neuroimaging research showing that mental states are spontaneously inferred on the basis of human behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Consequently, the particular statistical contrast is of less importance here and need not compare mentalizing   vs   non-mentalizing conditions, as long as meaningful understanding is extracted from the information in the main condition, and less so in the control condition. For example, when participants are passively listening or watching narratives about humans with the instruction that they will be asked questions about the plot, and the statistical contrast compares language comprehension (narratives)   vs   rest (blank screen) ( ), or when passively listening to narratives without further instructions and the contrast shows increased activation during semantic anomalies ( ). \n  \n Emotion attributions   to others (including preferences of others), answering questions such as \u2018what is X feeling\/liking?\u2019 or \u2018who is happier\/angrier?\u2019, which are often based on stimuli involving facial and body expressions as well as emotional ratings of human actions. There is ample evidence that mentalizing \u2018is implicated in consciously reflecting upon or regulating \u2026 someone else\u2019s affective states (e.g. X smiles), which involves empathizing with someone\u2019s feelings\u2019 ( , p. 1595). Note that emotional experiences by the self are categorized in a separate task category (see below). \n  \n Social Animations   of geometrical shapes (e.g. two triangles) of which \u2018the movements portrayed actions which are typical for an intentional or social interaction\u2019 ( , p. 16). \n  \n Goals   are implied given human actions and human narratives involving a target object or state when answering questions such as \u2018why is X doing this, what goal is X pursuing?\u2019 \n  \n Beliefs   of others, answering questions such as \u2018what is X thinking\/believing?\u2019 often during human actions and human narratives. This often involves \u2018false belief stories as the prototypical problem for theory of mind reasoning\u2019 ( , p. 13). \n  \n Morality   by others, answering questions such as \u2018what is X\u2019s responsibility?\u2019 (e.g. X harms Y purposefully), often during recounted or observed human actions and narratives. Describes \u2018events of moral (in)justice with as main element the intentional act of wrongdoing or help\u2019 ( , p. 1595). \n  \n Causality   by others (i.e. agency), answering questions such as \u2018what is X causing\/controlling?\u2019 or \u2018what caused the behavior of X?\u2019, also during recounted or observed human actions and narratives. For example, when a person has varying levels of control over reaching a target, participants need to be aware of this and make appropriate causal attributions for successful performance ( ). \n  \n Dilemmas   under \u2018the hypothesis \u2026 that feedback from a social partner \u2013 indicated by her moves in the game \u2013 is spontaneously used to infer her intentions, even if participants are not explicitly told to mindread\u2019 ( , p. 15). Also includes self-decisions in dilemmas without human opponents, because this requires self-reflection about one\u2019s hypothetical future state for each of the options (and rewards) taken and foregone. \n  \n Autobiographies   or memories about actions of the self and others in a distinct past, future and hypothetical   imaginary   situation, answering questions such as \u2018what was\/will I be doing?\u2019 ( ). \n  \n Traits   of others and self, based on trait adjectives without action descriptions, answering questions such as what type of person someone is (e.g. how much does \u2018smart\u2019 apply to X?) involves \u2018conceptual knowledge about persons\u2019 ( , p. 13). \n  \nWe further excluded from social mentalizing the mere presence of humans while their actions are unclear or undetermined. Note that material that was not considered mentalizing by the researcher(s) conducting the study, was screened on the presence of humans in the stimuli (e.g. humans in the scenes, events, etc.) as determined from the description in the method section (denoted by H  in Table   and  ), examples in the method section (denoted by H ), or the Supplementary Material of the study (denoted by H ). Any material that contained more than 50% humans in the main experimental condition was included as mentalizing if it fulfilled one of the content criteria described above. For example, if sentences were explicitly screened for similar meaning (i.e. synonyms) and more than 50% of the sentences contained humans who engaged in various actions, this was categorized under the sub-category \u2018social meaning\u2019 ( ). \n  \n Emotional self-experiences   given questions such as \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019, or the attribution of an emotion to a situation without a clear interactive social context or actions, even without an explicit instructions to do so. We categorized the emotion category as a separate category in line with the majority of the emotion literature, although strictly speaking, emotional self-experiences or self-judgments involve mentalizing appraisal processes with the self as object rather than another person, also referred to as \u2018conceptualization\u2019 ( ) and \u2018mentalizing\u2019 ( ). Neuroimaging research shows that emotions show a large overlap with mentalizing ( ,  ), especially when they involve consciously re\ufb02ecting upon the reconstruction of events and (re)appraisals that lead to the emotion, or reflecting about their good or bad outcomes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, it is very likely that self-related emotions trigger mentalizing appraisals and so recruit the posterior cerebellum. This is supported by the finding that topic #26 in the 50 topics set of NeuroSynth, which is of most relevance, shows a ROI in the right posterior cerebellum roughly at MNI coordinates 26\u2009\u221278\u2009\u221234, which is between ROIs 1\/2 and 3\/4. \n  \n Semantic   understanding of language, that is, grasping the meaning of words, sentences and narratives. To understand a story or sentence, the comprehension of goals, behaviors and mind of agents is often a prerequisite, so that semantics share a lot of commonalities with mentalizing ( ). In line with the screening criteria as described above, studies in this category are purely semantic independent from a social context and contain less than 50% trials with humans. \n  \n Linguistic   functions involving grammar, spelling (of Western and Eastern characters) and pronunciation. These were all categorized as non-mentalizing. \n  \n Motor Execution   and   Motor Perception   involve evolutionary older key functions of the cerebellum, typically located in the anterior cerebellum. As noted above, when biological movements were executed by humans (or biological human-like movements by abstract shapes), the perception of these actions was categorized under motor perception as it may trigger social mirroring, rather than mentalizing ( ). \n  \n Somatosensory   refers to sensory functions that respond to changes inside or at the surface of the body. \n  \n Music   that clearly requires sensory input or motor responses that follow a sequence. \n  \n Cognitive   refers to a variety of processes such as executive functions to plan and direct goal-oriented behavior, and ignoring or resolving inconsistencies. It also includes memory and numerical operations. When out of a social context, these functions were categorized as non-mentalizing. \n  \nClassification of all the studies proceeded in two steps. The initial decision on eligibility, checking of coordinates and classification of task categories, modality, stimuli\/material, instructions and contrasts (see examples in Table  ) was made after a first reading of each article by Frank Van Overwalle (FVO), and Qianying Ma (QM) (ROI 1, 2 and 5), or QM alone (ROI 3 and 4). These classifications were then thoroughly checked by FVO. This final check generally confirmed the initial coordinates and the sub-division of the major task categories and stimulus modalities, although minor rephrasing and reinterpretation occurred for the mentalizing sub-categories (stimuli), instructions and contrasts. On the basis of a reviewer\u2019s suggestions, the classifications of the Mentalizing and Emotion categories were checked anew by FVO and QM, leading to some re-categorizations. All these classifications are reported in full in the  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nSome exemplary studies are listed in Table  , listing all major tasks and mentalizing categories included in this meta-analysis.   lists the details of all individual studies, including task categories, mentalizing content, stimulus modality, stimulus material, instructions and contrasts. \n\nA summary overview of the major task categories is given in Table   (top panel), showing the percentage of studies that revealed activation in each of the ROIs. As predicted, in Crus II (ROIs 1\u20134), the mentalizing category involved the majority of the studies with an average of 57% over all ROIs (ranging from 46% to 67%), while in Crus I (ROI 5) this reduced to 35%. Since the emotional self-experiences category may be considered as mentalizing, we also took both categories together. The reason is that emotional self-experiences involve mentalizing appraisal processes with the self rather than another person as object of judgment. These self-directed processes have been referred to as \u2018conceptualization\u2019 ( ) and \u2018mentalizing\u2019 ( ). This combined mentalizing and emotional categorization resulted in an average Crus II involvement for 74% of the studies, as compared to 35% for Crus I. In addition, in Crus II a sizeable number of studies also involved semantic, motor-related, musical and cognitive tasks (each no more than 8% on average). In contrast, Crus I revealed a variety of non-mentalizing processes, starting with cognitive tasks as most strongly represented (most often numeric or memory tasks; 18%), followed by tasks related to semantics (15%), somatosensory experience (12%), music (9%), motor processes (6%) and language (6%). \n  \nMajor task categories and social sub-categories of the regions of interest, and comparative data on topics in the NeuroSynth database \n  \nPercentages in the cells refer to the proportion of studies within a category in relation to the total number of all studies (top panel), or total number of mentalizing studies (middle and bottom panels). The NeuroSynth topics were selected from an available set of 50 topics extracted from the abstracts of all articles in the NeuroSynth database as of July 2018. Topic words between parentheses are selected as most representatives from the first two most sampled terms ( ). Italics refer to the means across ROI1 to ROI4 (all Crus II)\u2009=\u2009mean value of the four Crus II Regions of Interest. \n\n Includes one \u2018Visual\u2019 study in ROI\u2009\u221224\u2009\u221276\u2009\u221240. \n  \nWe explored whether there were any differences between the number of studies in Crus II against Crus I, using a X test assuming an equal distribution across the ROIs. Comparing mentalizing, emotional self-experiences and all other categories combined (Table  ), this difference was highly significant, X (2)\u2009=\u200915.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001. We further explored any differences within the four ROIs in Crus II and found an unexpected increase in the right as opposed to the left ROIs for the semantic task category, X (3)\u2009=\u200914.00,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01. These findings are probably related to the contralateral connectivity with left-located languages areas in the cerebrum. \n\nTo provide a comparative base rate of the typical number of fMRI studies of each task category, we queried the NeuroSynth database and listed in Table   (top panel, far right) the number of available studies under several topics from the set of 50 topics in the database closely related to our task categories (extracted in July 2018;  ). This comparison evidently assumes that the work tabulated in NeuroSynth, and in the field at large, is somehow representative of the distribution of processes in the human brain. Note that when more than one topic was selected, we counted only one time each study contributing to multiple topics (i.e. without duplicates). As can be seen, across the whole brain, all topics ranged between 6% and 29% of all fMRI studies, indicating that the high incidence of mentalizing\/emotion studies in Crus II in our study does not result from a higher base rate of this type of studies, but seems to be specific to this area. Although the topics from NeuroSynth are somewhat arbitrarily selected and the reported base rates are therefore suggestive at best, this conclusion is upheld when other relevant topics from NeuroSynth are selected. \n\nTable   (middle panel) also provides the mentalizing sub-categories (see also Figure  ), reflecting the content of mentalizing. Consistent with our prediction, for the ROIs in Crus II, the highest percentages are found for mentalizing sub-categories that directly reflect or imply human behavior and movement, including social meaning (13%), explicit goals (6%), beliefs (15%) and autobiographies (16%), with the highest incidence for emotion attribution often via facial\/bodily expressions (28%). Higher-order attributions involving morality (1%) and causality (2%) can be considered as higher-order goal attributions referring to human responsibility and causality of goal-driven behavior and may be added to that category. In contrast, as predicted, lower percentages are generally found for mentalizing sub-categories that do not reflect human action sequences, such as trait judgments (12%) and dilemmas (6%). Note, however, that these percentages are not compared against existing base rates, so that they are descriptive at best. Exploratory X tests did not reveal significant differences between the four ROIs of Crus II,   P  \u2009>\u20090.05. \n\nFinally, Table   (bottom panel) provides the stimulus categories of the mentalizing studies, which were derived from the stimuli of the main condition in all included studies (see  , \u2018Stimuli of Main Condition\u2019 columns). Consistent with our prediction that the cerebellum is involved in dynamic sequencing of action and movement, for the ROIs in Crus II, on average the largest proportion of the stimulus material involved human actions (47%) and autobiographic memories of actions (12%), or a total of 59%. If we include facial\/bodily expressions (18%), the total proportion raises to a mean 77%. Exploratory X tests revealed significant differences between the Crus II ROIs for autobiographic memories, X (3)\u2009=\u200910.00,   P  \u2009<\u20090.05, showing that these were more activated for the right than left ROIs. Note, however, that the proportion of all action- and emotion-related material was also substantial for the Crus I ROI 5 (58%), suggesting that many mentalizing inferences in both Crus I and II are supported by them. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis explored the functional role of the posterior cerebellum in mentalizing. Given that the ROIs in the bilateral Crus II derived from earlier belief sequencing studies (\u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs 1 and 2 with MNI coordinates\u2009\u00b124\u2009\u221276\u2009\u221240) and from the NeuroSynth mentalizing meta-analysis (\u2018mentalizing\u2019 ROIs 3 and 4 with MNI coordinates\u2009\u00b126\u2009\u221284\u2009\u221234) are located within the mentalizing network by   and are close to the cluster peaks reported in a recent meta-analysis by  , we hypothesized that these areas are specialized in mentalizing. Consistent with this prediction, we found that a large majority of 74% of the eligible studies involved mentalizing functions, including emotions attributed to others and self-experienced emotions. Other non-mentalizing functions formed small minorities and were variously related to motor, somatosensory and executive tasks (including music, semantics, memory, numbers, and so on). We found no differences in mentalizing activity between these four ROIs. The high incidence of mentalizing in Crus II is very distinct from the lower base rate across the whole brain as revealed in NeuroSynth. \n\nConsistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is involved in action sequence detection, a high incidence of mentalizing sub-categories was based on actual or reconstructed human actions, such as when attributing social meaning (i.e. implicit goals), explicit goals, beliefs and autobiographic memories. Interestingly, the highest incidence was found for emotion attribution, often on the basis of static facial and bodily expressions. Given that emotion attribution and experience has been left out from many recent meta-analyses on mentalizing (e.g.  ;  ; but not in  ), more research on the role of the cerebellum in emotion attribution is needed to understand their relationship with mentalizing. This relationship might be complex, as recent studies with cerebellar patients show impairments on social mentalizing, but not necessarily on emotion attribution ( ; Van Overwalle   et al.  ,  ). In contrast, as predicted, lower percentages were generally revealed for mentalizing without explicit human sequencing, such as trait attributions, and dilemmas. \n\nWe also hypothesized that the Crus I ROI 5 (with MNI coordinates\u2009\u221240\u2009\u221270\u2009\u221240) would reveal less empirical support for mentalizing functionality, because it is located close to the boundary of the mentalizing and executive network ( ). Consistent with this expectation, only 35% of the studies recruiting this area were related to mentalizing and self-related emotionality. The other activations were related to a variety of other mental processes, of which the most prominent ones (i.e. cognitive, 18%, and semantic\/linguistic, 15%) are consistent with the location of this area close to the executive network. Of critical importance is that the lower degree of mentalizing activations in Crus I, together with the low base rate in the NeuroSynth database, suggests that the high incidence of mentalizing processes in our meta-analysis is related to its specific location in the bilateral Crus II. \n\nThe high percentage of mentalizing studies in Crus II is surprising. In an earlier meta-analysis on the cerebellum ( ;\u2009>\u2009350 studies), activation of the cerebellum was revealed in only about one-third of the social cognitive studies (except for more abstract categories such as traits and autobiographic memories, showing activation in about three-fourth of the studies). However, this lower percentage in past research might be due to several methodological limitations of the studies included. We surmise that many researchers simply neglected (parts of) the cerebellum in the scanning procedure (i.e. window) or scientific reports, as they might have not expected that the cerebellum was important for social functioning. Also surprising is that this earlier meta-analysis revealed most mentalizing in Crus I rather than Crus II, although this might in part be due to shortcomings in the conversion from the original Talairach to MNI coordinates which may have led to underreported Crus II clusters. In contrast, a recent large-scale analysis by   ( ; 787 participants) reported about equal recruitment of Crus I and Crus II, but their analysis involved only social animations and no other mentalizing tasks, which seriously limits this finding. Moreover, as noted in the introduction, the high incidence of mentalizing in Crus II is consistent with recent fMRI studies focusing on the connectivity of the cerebellum with the cerebral cortex among healthy adults ( ,  ) or individuals with autism ( ), and the cerebellar network structure proposed by several authors ( ;  ). \n\nThe existence of a small incidence of additional functions besides mentalizing in Crus II, such as various sensorimotor and executive functions (including semantics, linguistics and memory) is consistent with similar overlap found between these functions in the meta-analysis of the cerebellum mentioned earlier ( ). More work is needed to establish whether these overlapping functions are empirically robust, either at a meta-analytic level or within single studies. Are these overlaps due to specific core operations that support multiple mentalizing and non-mentalizing processes sub-served in these cerebellar areas? Or are mentalizing   vs   non-mentalizing functions separated by loose patchy boundaries in the cerebellum? These are fascinating questions for future research. Perhaps studies that directly compare social information processing (e.g. false beliefs) with non-social controls (e.g. outdated photos), can provide more insight in this question, by revealing areas in the cerebellum common to the underlying reasoning but distinct in their social content. However, from all studies reviewed in this article, none provided sufficient information to answer this question. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe present meta-analysis has a number of limitations. Perhaps the most important limitation is that readers should be aware that we screened only a limited set of ROIs, not the whole Crus I\/II area. Thus, it might well be that beyond the ROIs investigated here, some areas in Crus II are less specialized in mentalizing or that some areas in Crus I are more specialized. Moreover, other areas in the cerebellum might be relevant. For instance, lobule VI was revealed by   as another important area involved in self-references and autobiographic memories (often involving the self), and in the large-scale analysis by   as involved in social animations. However, this area was also associated with many non-mentalizing tasks in the meta-analysis by   and  , so that it might be less specialized for social mentalizing. \n\nSecond, the selection of studies was based on a single database: NeuroSynth. This was for obvious reasons, namely, to conduct a reverse meta-analysis starting from fMRI studies within a set of pre-determined spheres (ROIs) in the posterior cerebellum. \n\nThird, the studies were limited to MNI coordinates. This was because of the uncertainty surrounding Talairach coordinates, as they were not always converted to MNI coordinates in the NeuroSynth database and thus often fell beyond our pre-determined spheres with 6 mm radius. Because current studies are mostly reported in MNI coordinates, this limitation affected most often older studies. \n\nFourth, we included emotional self-experiences as a separate task category and not as part of our \u2018mentalizing\u2019 studies. Although one might concur that that emotional self-experiences involve somatosensory processes that are available only to the self, and not when processing others, modern views of emotions consider emotional appraisals or conceptualization as mentalizing processes, which are an intimate part of emotions ( ) in which a person turns his or her perspective to the mental state of the self. More generally, many studies categorized as mentalizing did not reflect pure social-cognitive processes and often included elements of emotionality. This is consistent with neuroimaging research showing that emotions show a large overlap with mentalizing ( ,  ). \n\nFifth, we used the NeuroSynth database to gauge the base rate of similar task categories across the whole brain. Although the \u2018topics\u2019 in NeuroSynth are the closest match to the present task categories, obviously they have been defined and compiled in a completely different manner, so that these comparisons are merely indicative. \n\nSixth, we found no lateralization in the ROIs considered, except for semantics. This is an issue for further research on the cerebellum, although this might be quite unsuccessful because meta-analyses of cortical areas involved in social mentalizing often failed to find evidence for strong hemispheric differences (e.g.  ). \n\nA final limitation concerns the specificity of the mentalizing and self-related emotional processes being studied in this meta-analysis. All socially relevant studies were included, except for two categories\u2014social mirroring and the mere presence of humans (when their actions were unclear). Apart from these two, it may appear that all aspects of social or self-referential cognition fall under the heading of mentalizing. However, this may be a consequence of the sharp categorization of studies in the service of our meta-analysis, since a more graded perspective is possible, and empirically supported. As mentioned earlier, a recent study documented that cerebellar patients were most impaired when generating the correct sequence of cartoons involving false beliefs, but less so for social routines and non-social events (Van Overwalle   et al.  ,  ). Likewise, an fMRI study on the same task revealed the highest Crus II activation when stories involved beliefs and less so when they involved social routines and non-social events ( ). Thus, to the extent that social actions are automated and require little or no mentalizing, they seem to activate the posterior cerebellum less or not at all. \n\n\n### Theoretical implications \n  \nSome popular explanations of the role of the cerebellum in social cognition did not receive much support in the present study. First, there was little evidence for theories that view the cerebellum as a domain-general modulator of cognitive processes that updates information and sends adaptive feedback to the cerebral cortex (e.g.  ;  ). In this view, the cerebellum itself is not responsible for any particular function, but rather facilitates the efficiency by which other neocortical structures perform their own processes. Second, a general time-keeping role of the cerebellum, which coordinates the inputs and outputs from varied sources during processing, as proposed by  , is also unlikely. If a timing function plays a role in social thought, it most likely does so during mirroring of observed movements, which was not the focus of this analysis. \n\nIn contrast, the present domain-specific results on mentalizing in Crus II are consistent with the view that the general function of the cerebellum is to construct internal models of motor and non-motor sequences of behavior and to directly manipulate through error-feedback the final outputs of sensorimotor, cognitive and emotional functions ( ;  ;  ;  ). This general cerebellar role of sequencing reveals regional differences as a function of the heterogeneous connections to specific functional domains in the cerebral cortex, which contact at precise locations in the cerebellum. As suggested by the present analysis and earlier connectivity studies on the social cerebellum ( ,  ,  ,  ;  ;  ), key mentalizing areas in the cerebrum are connected via closed loops with the bilateral Crus II, and so renders this cerebellar area socially relevant. By making plans for sequences in advance and sending corrective feedback about various potential responses of other persons (based on internal cerebellar models), the cerebellum facilitates easy and spontaneous social interaction. \n\n\n### Clinical implications \n  \nThe involvement of Crus II in mentalizing offers interesting avenues for clinical diagnosis and treatment of cerebellar and related impairments. First, with respect to diagnosis, this offers tools to predict impairments in specific social mentalizing functions that might be too easily ignored, given the important motoric dysfunctions that are clinically very apparent ( ;  ;  ). To illustrate, a recent study with autistic adults, analyzing anatomical and structural changes in the cerebellum ( ), provided evidence for the mentalizing role of the cerebellum in ASD dysfunctions. The results showed decreased cerebellar grey matter volume in the right Crus II with peak voxel (MNI 29\u2009\u221273\u2009\u221243) centered very close to the present \u2018sequencing\u2019 ROIs, and this reduced volume was correlated with the degree of autistic traits. Second, this location might become a spot for brain stimulation treatments, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) ( ,  ). One promising TMS study ( ) provided some evidence for reduction of social stereotyping after stimulating the right Crus I (which arguably affected a larger part of the posterior cerebellum). Third, the sequencing hypothesis of social action might offer suggestions for behavioral clinical treatment, because sequencing in social interaction has not attracted a lot of interest in current research on social neuroimaging and treatment. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present meta-analysis shows that a domain-specific mentalizing function is supported in the cerebellar Crus II lobule. Within four bilateral ROIs in this area, we found an incidence of 74% of mentalizing functions related to social cognition and self-related emotional cognition. This points to highly specialized areas for mentalizing processes. Importantly, this indicates that the cerebellum has an important social function that has been hereto largely neglected in the scientific community, but one that receives growing evidence from neuroimaging research. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7851889,"text_md5":"35c5332c313928500800e8d1a959bcc4","field_positions":{"authors":[0,56],"journal":[57,81],"publication_year":[83,87],"title":[98,216],"keywords":[230,307],"abstract":[320,1653],"body":[1662,53534]},"batch":2,"pmid":32888303,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsaa124","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7851889","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7851889"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7851889\">7851889<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7851889  The posterior crus II cerebellum is specialized for social mentalizing and emotional self-experiences: a meta-analysis"}

Here we look at anticipation of monetary gain and loss contrasted with neutral anticipation. We meta-analysed data from 15 original whole-brain group maps (  n  \u2009=\u2009346) and report extensive areas of relative activation and deactivation throughout the whole brain. For both anticipation of gain and loss we report robust activation of the striatum, activation of key nodes of the putative salience network, including anterior cingulate and anterior insula, and more complex patterns of activation and deactivation in the central executive and default networks. On between-group comparison, we found significantly greater relative deactivation in the left inferior frontal gyrus associated with incentive valence. This meta-analysis provides a robust whole-brain map of a reward anticipation network in the healthy human brain. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007\/s11065-018-9385-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nReward processing in the brain is an iterative learning process involving goal-directed behaviour and adaptive decision-making in response to a stimulus. Stimulus presentation followed by receipt of reward increases the likelihood of a behaviour occurring again. A reward stimulus (incentive) has an intrinsic value (valence) which makes it salient, standing out from a background of stimulus bombardment. Incentives may be innately rewarding to an organism (e.g. sex, food), known as intrinsic rewards, or may be neutral at first and learnt by association, known as extrinsic rewards (e.g. money). The anticipation of a reward incentive prepares an approach behaviour, creating motivational salience, and the consumption of the reward reinforces motivational salience. \n\nThe neural mechanism of reward processing is beginning to be understood. Physiological work in primates revealed that reward prediction is mediated by dopaminergic neurons in the striatum (Schultz et al.  ). Moreover a putative salience network has been identified by functional connectivity analysis (Seeley et al.  ) which may be involved in choosing stimuli worthy of attention from a continuous stream of internally and externally generated inputs to the brain, thought to be anchored in the anterior cingulate and anterior insula (Uddin  ). \n\nThe monetary incentive delay task is a widely used and validated reward processing task adapted for use in human fMRI studies to investigate motivational salience processes in health and disease. It was developed based on instrumental conditioning paradigms employed in animal studies (Schultz et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ). The monetary incentive delay task allows reward processing to be parsed into at least two distinct components, namely, \u2018anticipation\u2019 and \u2018feedback\u2019. Typically, the task consists of a sequence of three visual stimulus events (Fig.\u00a0 ), (1)   anticipation,   a learned visual cue representing valence (e.g. financial gain-circle, loss-square, neutral-triangle) which elicits motivational salience, (2)   the target  , another learned visual cue (e.g. rectangle) to initiate the behaviour, usually pressing a button on time (a time-dependent motor task), and (3)   feedback   in the form of text or image indicating consummation (financial gain, loss, neutral) and dependent on performance.   \nExample of visual cues presented during a trial of the monetary incentive delay task \n  \n\nWhen studied with fMRI, the two main phases when imaging data are acquired include (1) during and after the first visual stimulus (anticipation\/motivational salience) and (2) during and after the third visual stimulus (feedback\/consummation). Because of individual variation in performance, the duration of target presentation may be adjusted automatically within the program such that each participant experiences approximately the same success rates, usually set at around 66%. Typically, there are three main anticipation conditions, win, neutral or lose. The anticipation conditions are coupled with five main feedback conditions dependent on type of anticipation and performance (e.g. target hit or missed), namely, 1) anticipation-win-hit, 2) anticipation-win-miss, 3) anticipation-lose-hit, 4) anticipation-lose-miss and 5) anticipation-neutral. The neutral anticipation stimulus is used as a contrast to control for aspects of visual and motor processing commonly engaged during the different conditions. There are multiple variations that can be introduced, but in this meta-analysis we focus only on the anticipation conditions stimulating positive, neutral and negative salience through monetary gain or loss. \n\nThe original investigations of the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults (Knutson et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ) reported that anticipation of reward (versus neutral) was associated with activation of multiple regions including areas implicated in both reward prediction (bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate and left putamen) and the salience network (bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate gyrus). \n\nSince the original studies, many more studies have used the monetary incentive delay task to investigate brain networks engaged in reward processing. The monetary incentive delay task has mainly been used to study differences between demographic groups (e.g. adolescents and adults, males and females), clinical populations (e.g.   major   depression, psychosis) or interventions (e.g. placebo). Several whole-brain meta-analyses have been conducted looking at reward anticipation in healthy adults using a variety of tasks and a mixture of different rewards, such as monetary, food, points, social feedback and pleasing images (Liu et al.  ; Diekhof et al.  ; Bartra et al.  ). We identified only two meta-analyses focusing on reward anticipation in healthy adults using solely the monetary incentive delay task. The first meta-analysis of healthy adults using the monetary incentive delay task alone (Knutson et al.  ) contrasted anticipation win directly with anticipation lose, whereas the second, more recent meta-analyses (Oldham et al.  ) contrasted both win and lose with neutral conditions. Both analyses found that regions implicated in reward prediction and the salience network were activated. \n\nAll of the aforementioned meta-analyses, including the two focusing only on the reward processing in healthy adults employed the activation likelihood estimation technique (Turkeltaub et al.  ) using published text coordinates. However, coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches cannot fully account for within study and random between study variation, because they do not include the full statistical images and exclude null findings unlike image-based meta-analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). Coordinate-based methods such as activation likelihood estimation treat all foci of activation equally regardless of the strength of activation, and it has been shown that there is a poor similarity between coordinate and image based meta-analysis (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.  ). The seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analytic technique (Radua et al.  ) offers significant benefits over activation likelihood estimation, because it allows both thresholded coordinates and original group map image data to be combined creating maps effect-size. Furthermore, activation likelihood estimation and SDM answer slightly different questions. While the results of activation likelihood estimation-based meta-analysis may be interpreted as indicating the spatial convergence of previous findings, seed-based d mapping-based can be interpreted as direct increase or decrease in activity in the brain (M\u00fcller et al.  ). \n\nThe primary objective of this study was to conduct a whole brain meta-analysis of fMRI studies employing only the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults using the seed-based d mapping technique to investigate which brain regions are activated or deactivated during monetary reward anticipation. We specifically focused on the contrasts anticipation-win minus anticipation-neutral (AWAN) and anticipation-lose minus anticipation-neutral (ALAN), to confirm activation of regions implicated in reward processing, namely reward prediction and the salience networks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search Strategy and Study Selection \n  \nOn 15\/12\/14 we searched the NICE Healthcare Database including EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) using the terms ((\u201cmonetary\u201d AND \u201cincentive\u201d AND \u201cdelay\u201d AND \u201cfmri\u201d).ti,ab OR (\u201cmonetary\u201d AND (\u201creward\u201d OR \u201cincentiv*\u201d OR \u201canticipat*\u201d) AND \u201cfmri\u201d).ti,ab) AND \u201carticle\u201d [Limit to: Publication Year 2000\u20132014]. We complemented this with a cross-reference search of Pubmed on 16\/12\/14 with the general search term \u201cmonetary reward incentive anticipation fMRI\u201d. Study inclusion criteria were (i) inclusion of healthy adults, (ii) used fMRI, (iii) used Monetary Incentive Delay Task, (iv) article available in English, (v) published in a peer-reviewed journal, (vi) conditions and contrasts of interest included, (vii) whole-brain analysis reported. We also included the placebo condition of intervention studies in healthy participants meeting criteria. Full articles were read and excluded if the above inclusion criteria were not met. The search was repeated using the same search terms and databases on 19\/1\/17, ranging from December 2014 onwards and excluding any repeated articles. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nFor all the articles that satisfied study inclusion criteria, all authors or corresponding authors were contacted by published email address in March 2015 requesting whole brain maps. Research groups who sent maps were included in the Monetary incentive delay Task Analysis Consortium (MTAC) (Supplementary References 1). If no maps were available for use, we manually extracted the whole-brain only coordinates from the published article for the conditions of interest for the healthy adult sample. For all articles (both maps-received and coordinates only), information on the MRI scanner, scanning sequence and timings, parameters of the monetary incentive delay task and performance data where available were extracted manually by two researchers (Colizzi and Wilson) and cross-checked for errors. This process of contacting authors was repeated for a follow-up literature search in March 2017. If no maps were available, we did not extract published article because of positive effect-size bias detected in the first round (see Results). \n\n\n### Data Analysis: Seed-Based D Mapping \n  \nMeta-analysis was carried out using the seed-based d mapping software employing previously described methods (Radua et al.  ; Radua and Mataix-Cols  ; Radua et al.  ,  ). In brief, the aim of seed-based d mapping is to create voxel-level maps of effect-size measured as Hedge\u2019s\u00a0g allowing modelling of both positive and negative activations on the same map. For each reported peak coordinate and value (t, z or p), seed-based d mapping ensures surrounding voxels have a similar but smaller estimated effect size by multiplication with an un-normalised Gaussian kernel. If a voxel should have a value assigned from more than one coordinate, the values are averaged weighting by the square of the distance to each close peak. The data from each study are then weighted by the inverse of the sum of variance plus between study variance and combined using the random effects model DerSimonian-Laird estimator (DerSimonian and Laird  ). This approach allows for studies with a larger sample size or lower variability to contribute more and creates a map of heterogeneity. \n\nManually extracted whole-brain coordinates and group maps were formatted for seed-based d mapping. For coordinates, this involved conversion to Tailarach, for group maps conversion to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format, left-right correction and preprocessing including reslicing data into a common voxel size by interpolation (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u200920\u00a0mm). Meta-analysis produced mean maps with non-overlapping clusters of activation and deactivation for each contrast. A non-parametric approach was used where   p  -values and seed-based d mapping z-scores were created by randomisation, as opposed to standard z-scores. \n\nIn neuroimaging analyses, as well as in meta-analyses, the need for appropriate statistical thresholding to minimize the extent of false positive results must be balanced against the need for avoiding false negatives (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). Typically, neuroimaging meta-analyses control for the false discovery rate to minimize false positive results, which we have also reported. However, it is worth noting that the choice of threshold is best guided by the specific research context (M\u00fcller et al.  ). In the present study, we did not employ the conventional threshold, but instead combined an intensity threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.005) with a cluster extent threshold (cluster >10 voxels) that has been shown to result in acceptable Type II error rates (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). \n\nThus seed-based d mapping generated mean maps were thresholded at the validated default settings p\u2009<\u20090.005, seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091.0, cluster>10 voxels. In seed-based d mapping, using a cluster size of 10 voxels and an uncorrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.005 has been shown empirically to be equivalent to corrected   p  \u2009=\u20090.05, optimally balancing sensitivity and specificity, and seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091 reduces the false positive rate (Radua et al.  ). Given 100% parametric maps, this results in 100% sensitivity and a 3.5% false positive rate to produce the final whole brain maps of statistical significance, accompanied by an HTML document of main peaks,   p   value, seed-based d mapping-z-score, MNI coordinates, number of voxels per cluster and significant sub-peaks within each cluster (also with p value and seed-based d mapping-z-score). All results at the default seed-based d mapping-z\u2009>\u20091 threshold are reported in the supplementary material for the interested reader, however in the main text we have reported only those results that survived a more conservative threshold (z-score\u2009\u2265\u20095.0). The \u20185-sigma\u2019 threshold for significance (Horton  ) is a consensus agreement in other scientific disciplines, reflecting five standard deviations from the mean, or   p  \u2009<\u20090.0000003). We have adopted this threshold in order to further minimize the probability of detecting an effect by chance and to identify the most critical regions involved in motivational salience, reflecting high confidence that these are true positives when contrasting anticipation win or loss with neutral. \n\nJacknife sensitivity analysis of replicability, analysis of heterogeneity and publication bias are automated within the seed-based d mapping program. Jacknife analysis involves re-analysing mean maps multiple times by leaving out a single study each time. In order to interpret the many Jacknife mean maps, we thresholded for significance, binarized the data and combined into a single overlapping density map of significant data. This allowed visual inspection of areas of low density, signifying lower replicability across studies. Inter-study heterogeneity was calculated in which Q  statistics are converted to standard z values to create a map. This map was overlaid on the final mean map for visual inspection of areas of overlapping significant heterogeneity with areas of thresholded activation or deactivation. Publication bias was estimated using standard funnel plots and Egger\u2019s test for each reported peak. The funnel plots consisted of effect-size on the x-axis and standard error on the y-axis with bias tested using Egger\u2019s test for asymmetry of the funnel plot. \n\nThe anatomical location of the peaks were identified using the Atlas of the Human Brain and associated BrainNavigator program (Mai et al.  ). As the atlas did not cover the cerebellum, so the Talairach Daemon (Lancaster et al.  ; Lancaster et al.  ) was used, following MNI to Talairach conversion. \n\nFollowing mean map analysis, the two contrasts AWAN and ALAN were compared using the automated linear model analysis which calculates the between-group difference based on statistical significance after Monte Carlo randomisation. In order to study potential confounders, automated linear model meta-regression was calculated, whereby the difference between the minimum and maximum values of regressors are returned with statistical significance based on Monte Carlo randomisation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFollowing removal of duplicates, and screening of abstracts, from an initial list of 288 articles a final selection of 108 articles were eligible for inclusion. We contacted all corresponding authors for the 108 articles of whom 70 responded. Brain maps corresponding to 36 articles were received. Of these, 21 were excluded for reasons detailed in the Prisma flow diagram (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nPRISMA flow diagram \n  \n\nIn total 15 sets of whole brain group maps were included in the meta-analysis of anticipation (Supplementary Table 1). Thirty-three articles were included in the first stage of the meta-analysis including 18 sets of whole-brain coordinates extracted from the text (Supplementary Table 1). No additional maps were included on repeating the literature search two years later. The omnibus sample size for all 33 non-overlapping samples (maps and text coordinates) was 728 healthy adults, mean age 30.3\u00a0years (SD 7.81), 60.6% male, and 98.8% right-handed (Table  ). See Supplementary Tables\u00a01, 2 and 3 for full demographics, monetary incentive delay task specifics and fMRI acquisition and analysis for each study.   \nSummary of available demographics for omnibus data of coordinates and group maps combined and of group maps only \n  \npooled SD excluding datasets where no SD reported;  mean of available data, only 25\/33 sets total: 24\/32 AW, 21\/21 AL \n  \n\nAn initial omnibus analysis combined group maps and published text coordinates. However, we found significant bias for the two most significant peaks of the AWAN and ALAN contrasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Table 4). Given this finding and the theoretical discrepancies between coordinate and image-based meta-analysis previously discussed, we report only the   group map   meta-analysis from here on (Supplementary Table 5). \n\n### Anticipation Win Minus Anticipation Neutral \n  \nThis contrast was examined in a total sample size of 274 participants (Table  ). \n\n#### Activation \n  \nEleven main peaks in eleven clusters were identified (size: 10 to 25,114 voxels, z-score: 3.967 to 9.798, Table  , Fig.\u00a0 ). Eight main peaks and 144 subpeaks exceeded z\u2009=\u20095.0. The main peak of largest cluster was located in the right superior frontal gyrus lateral part extending widely to include, amongst 140 subpeaks, the caudate and putamen bilaterally, left fundus region of caudate (proximate to nucleus accumbens) and right nucleus accumbens. The remaining main peaks z\u2009>\u20095.0 were bilateral middle frontal gyri, bilateral inferior temporal gyri, left paracentral lobule, left occipital gyrus and left parahippocampal gyrus.   \nAnticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral main peaks for SDM z-score\u2009>\u20095\u2009or <\u2009\u22125 \n  \nMNI (Montreal Neurological Institute), SDM-z (Signed Differential Mapping z-score), FDR (false discovery rate) \n    \nMean maps thresholded to signed differential mapping z-score\u2009>\u20095. Top row - anticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral with activation in red. Middle row - anticipation win-vs-anticipation neutral with deactivation in blue. Bottom row - anticipation lose-vs-anticipation neutral with activation in red \n  \n\n\n#### Deactivation \n  \nThirteen main peaks in thirteen clusters were identified (size: 36\u20134857 voxels, z-score: 1.022\u20136.434, Table  , Fig.  ). Two main peaks and one subpeak exceeded z\u2009=\u20095 located in the right superior temporal gyrus and left angular gyrus. \n\n\n\n### Anticipation Lose Minus Anticipation Neutral \n  \nThis contrast was examined in a combined sample of 246 participants (Table  ). \n\n#### Activation \n  \nWe found nineteen main peaks (z-score: 3.947\u20136.801, size: 12\u201311,315 voxels, Table  , Fig.  ). Seven main peaks and 65 subpeaks exceeded z\u2009=\u20095.0 (Supplementary 4.3). The main peak of the largest cluster was located in the left superior frontal gyrus medial part extending widely to include, amongst 47 subpeaks, bilateral putamen and right caudate. In descending order, other main peaks z\u2009>\u20095 .0 were located in the left parieto-occipital transition zone, right supramarginal gyrus (2 main peaks), left hippocampus CA1, right fusiform gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus.   \nAnticipation lose-vs-anticipation neutral main peaks for SDM z-score\u2009>\u20095\u2009<\u2009\u22125 \n  \nMNI (Montreal Neurological Institute), SDM-z (Signed Differential Mapping z-score), FDR (false discovery rate) \n  \n\n\n#### Deactivation \n  \nNo main peaks exceeded the raised threshold z\u2009>\u20095, though multiple peaks were significant (Supplementary Table 5.a-d for full breakdown). \n\n\n\n### Between Group Comparison: AWAN Minus ALAN \n  \nOn between-group linear model comparison between AWAN and ALAN, we found significantly greater   deactivation   in AWAN compared to ALAN in the left inferior frontal gyrus opercular part (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table 6).   \nBetween group comparison of anticipation win-vs-neutral minus anticipation lose-vs-neutral showing relative deactivation in blue \n  \n\n\n### Publication Bias, Heterogeneity, Sensitivity and Confounders \n  \nFunnel plots revealed no clear evidence of marked asymmetry on visual inspection for the higher thresholded main peaks for either contrast (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), also surviving Egger\u2019s test for bias (Tables\u00a0  &  ). Maps of significant heterogeneity (Q ) were overlaid on the mean maps for both contrasts to visually inspect for overlapping areas (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). For AWAN significant heterogeneity overlapped with activation in the bilateral ventral striatum and bilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei. For ALAN, overlap was seen in bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus and the left precentral gyrus. Visual inspection of Jacknife analysis overlaid on the heterogeneity maps showed good replicability of all areas reported in both contrasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). \n\nOutside of the task conditions, two independent regressors were available, namely, placebo intervention and scanner strength. Seventy of the 274 (26%) subjects in AWAN and 59 of the 246 (24%) in ALAN were given placebo (wash-out period 1 to 2\u00a0weeks). Overlaying heterogeneity maps for each contrast with meta-regression for placebo showed overlap with activation in AWAN in the bilateral ventral striatum, but no visual overlap in the ALAN contrast (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 8). \n\nRegarding field strength, for AWAN 7 of 14 mean maps were generated using a 3\u00a0T scanner, for ALAN 5 of 11 maps were 3\u00a0T and the remainder for both 1.5\u00a0T. No areas of overlap in heterogeneity corresponded to areas of activation or deactivation in the mean maps (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05, Supplementary Table 9). \n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate which regions of the brain are robustly engaged by reward processing in healthy adult humans, specifically looking at motivational salience, that is, presentation of reward incentive and preparation of approach behaviour. Using all available fMRI group-map data for the anticipation of reward and loss conditions of the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adult humans, our meta-analysis shows that there are large areas of both   activation   and   deactivation   across the whole brain in motivational salience. For the first time, we report the pattern of deactivation in anticipation of reward in the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adult humans. We also report evidence of positive effect-size bias in the anterior cingulate (AWAN) and striatum (AWAN and ALAN) in the literature. \n\nThe results presented here are consistent with those reported in a recent activation likelihood estimation based meta-analysis of reward anticipation using the monetary incentive delay task in healthy adults (Oldham et al.  ), but we report far more extensive areas of activation involving frontal, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions. Furthermore, we have reported on areas of relative deactivation as well as publication bias, heterogeneity, replicability, and the potential effects of placebo and scanner strength. \n\nWe have confirmed a number of regions of activation reported in the original monetary incentive delay task studies of healthy adults (Knutson et al.  ; Knutson et al.  ) for AWAN, including bilateral insula (left insula originally reported as motor cortex), right nucleus accumbens, nucleus accumbens, bilateral caudate, left putamen, thalamus, right amygdala, right anterior cingulate gyrus (both reported as \u2018right mesial prefrontal cortex\u2019), right superior frontal gyrus medial part (reported as \u2018right SMA\u2019) and right cerebellum anterior lobe culmen (reported as cerebellar vermis). However, we did not find any activation in the right amygdala or left nucleus accumbens, an area of significant heterogeneity. We have also greatly extended the pattern of activity such that all previous unilateral peaks, except right amygdala, were found to be bilateral including putamen, superior frontal gyrus (medial and lateral), anterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum anterior lobe culmen, and thalamic nuclei. We have provided greater resolution within the thalamus itself, finding activation in bilateral medial dorsal thalamic nuclei and two left ventral anterior thalamic nuclei. We report nine additional bilateral areas of activation including middle frontal gyri and inferior temporal gyri, precentral gyri, frontal operculae, paracingulate cortex, postcentral gyri, superior parietal lobules, precunei and insular gyri. We report twenty additional unilateral areas of activation (5 main peaks) including areas known to be implicated in both salience processing, such as the hippocampus (Crottaz-Herbette et al.  ), and reward processing, such as the right parahippocampal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (Brooks et al.  ). \n\n\n### Interpretation \n  \nAs predicted, the striatum is strongly engaged in both anticipation of reward and loss, though not clearly differentiated when comparing the two contrasts. We found significant heterogeneity in this area in the anticipation of reward across all studies which may be explained in part by placebo effects. \n\nBoth reward and loss anticipation robustly engage key nodes of the salience network including anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortex. However, a mixed picture emerged for the anterior cingulate with anticipation of reward strongly activating bilateral anterior cingulate with a single main peak of deactivation in the left anterior cingulate. In contrast, anticipation of loss strongly activated the left anterior cingulate only with no detected deactivation. This pattern of activation may be reflected in the AWAL between-group comparison (Supplementary Table 6) showing a subthreshold (cluster size 8 voxels) difference in activation in the left anterior cingulate. The anterior insula was activated bilaterally in both contrasts. The insula cortex is considered a major cortical target of ascending interoceptive and visceromotor signals passing through thalamic nuclei (Uddin  ) found to be functionally connected to amygdala, dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus peri-aqueductal grey matter (Seeley et al.  ). We confirmed activity in these regions, though seemingly a different pattern for each contrast (AWAN - bilateral dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, right periaqueductal grey matter; ALAN - right posterior hypothalamic area, left basomedial nucleus of the amygdala). \n\nThe right anterior insular cortex, in particular, is also thought to be involved in switching between two other networks, namely, the central-executive and the default-mode networks (Sridharan et al.  ). The central-executive network is considered the neural substrate underlying cognitive processes such as inhibition, interference control, working memory and cognitive flexibility (Diamond  ) and is thought to be anchored in the dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral parietal cortex (Sridharan et al.  ). We found strong bilateral activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in both contrasts in the bilateral middle frontal gyri and bilateral superior frontal gyri, lateral part. Regarding the lateral parietal cortex we found significant but differing patterns of activation for each contrast. In both conditions, there was bilateral activation of the superior parietal lobule and unilateral activation of the right angular gyrus. However in AWAN there was   unilateral   activation of the left supramarginal gyrus and deactivation in the   left   angular gyrus, and in ALAN   bilateral   activation of the supramarginal gyrus and unilateral deactivation of the   right   angular gyrus. \n\nThe default-mode network is considered a state of cortical activity independent of external stimuli (originally considered to be \u2018waking rest\u2019) convergent with areas active in resting state fMRI (Andrews-Hanna et al.  ) and task-induced deactivation (Andrews-Hanna,  ). This network has been further subdivided into a \u2018core\u2019 anchored in the posterior cingulate cortex and anteromedial prefrontal cortex, as well as the \u2018medial temporal\u2019 and\u2019 dorsal medial subsystems\u2019 (Andrews-Hanna  ). The core is associated with self-referential processes, the medial temporal subsystem corresponds to past and future autobiographical thought, episodic memory and contextual retrieval, and the dorsal medial subsystem corresponds to social cognition, story comprehension and semantic processing (Yeo et al.  ). We found bilateral activation of the \u2018core\u2019 posterior cingulate in both anticipation contrasts. Regarding the medial temporal subsystem, we observed a differing pattern of activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex with unilateral activation of the right posterior orbital gyrus in AWAN and unilateral activation of the left intermediate orbital gyrus in ALAN. In AWAN in the medial temporal lobe, there was bilateral deactivation in the parahippocampal gyrus in conjunction with unilateral activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Yet in ALAN we reported unilateral activation of the left hippocampus CA1 region. With respect to the dorsomedial subsystem, on the one hand we found robust bilateral activation of the superior frontal gyrus, lateral part in both contrasts. On the other hand, we saw a mixed picture in the lateral temporal cortex. The inferior temporal gyrus was activated in both contrasts. In AWAN, there was activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, deactivation in the right middle gyrus and deactivation in the right superior temporal gyrus. In ALAN there was activation in the left middle temporal gyrus, deactivation in bilateral middle temporal gyri and deactivation in the left superior temporal gyrus. \n\nThe monetary incentive delay task is also a motor processing task and, as such, we observed broad bilateral activation of primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), somatosensory cortex (post central gyrus), the supplementary motor area and multiple thalamic nuclei in both contrasts. The striatal region of the basal ganglia was activated, but no peaks were seen in the globus pallidus or subthalamic nuclei. Significant activity was also found in the cerebellum. In AWAN there was strong activation in bilateral anterior lobe of the cerebellum and a peak of deactivation in the right posterior lobe, but in ALAN a mixed picture of unilateral activation and deactivation in the right anterior lobe. It is known that there is an important function for the cerebellum in motivational salience, in keeping with a recent animal study (Cutando et al.  ) suggesting a role in encoding expectation of reward, the growing understanding of the reciprocal connections between cerebellum and basal ganglia (Niendam et al.  ) and cerebellar involvement in addiction (Moulton et al.  ). \n\nThese observed patterns of activation are controlled by the neutral condition in which the only theoretical difference in task activation is the absence of motivational salience. Could it be that common areas of activation and deactivation are part of a motivational salience network, robustly engaging the striatum, salience network, parts of the central executive and default networks and associated motor regions? The picture emerging from the central executive and default network appears more complicated with robust activation in the posterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but a differing pattern emerging between anticipation of reward and loss in the lateral parietal cortex, ventromedial cortex, medial (including hippocampus) and lateral temporal cortex. \n\n\n### Between-group comparisons \n  \nThe first meta-analysis of healthy controls discussed earlier compared uncontrolled anticipation of reward directly with loss (Knutson and Greer  ). We used a different approach (between-group linear model) comparing mean group maps for two controlled conditions, AWAN and ALAN. We report only one significant peak above threshold in the left inferior frontal gyrus operculum. This region was deactivated in both conditions, but significantly more deactivated in anticipating loss than reward. Additionally, the left anterior cingulate gyrus was active in both contrasts, significantly more so anticipating reward than while anticipating loss, but just under threshold (Supplementary Table 6). The left inferior frontal gyrus has previously been implicated in response inhibition (Swick et al.  ; Bhattacharyya et al.  ) and the attribution of aspects of stimulus salience and attentional allocation of resources (Seeley et al.  ; Bhattacharyya et al.  ; Downar et al.  ). Might this left inferior frontal activation reflect differential allocation of cognitive resources according to motivational salience or could this directly reflect a representation of valence? \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur findings are limited by the reported sample demographics, constraints of the monetary incentive delay task, the data acquisition and analysis, the methods of meta-analysis and the brain atlas used. Across all the studies, we were only able to report sample size, age, gender and handedness. Other variables such as substance use, education, IQ, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were too inconsistently reported for any meaningful interpretation. \n\nIn terms of the monetary incentive delay task, there was significant variation across designs. The maps we received were from many different international locations including Europe, the USA, Japan and South Korea. Therefore the financial incentive could have different meanings to different samples, although superficially they appear to be similarly small amounts of money. There was inconsistent reporting of, and variation in, the duration of all the phases of each trial, including monetary incentive stimulus presentation, anticipation, target, feedback and inter-stimulus interval. The data are gathered over multiple trials varying from 44 to 180 in each study, and the target hit rate was either unreported or varied from 50% to 75% which could have influenced any neural substrate for the temporally bound reward prediction error signal. The monetary incentive delay task is not designed to capture temporal learning or any reward prediction error signal. Variants of the monetary incentive delay task have been developed that introduce contingency, varying the predictability of reward receipt following action, and we have included a single group map in the AWAN condition introducing this (Li et al.  ). Lastly, overall performance data was not consistently reported, preventing meaningful behavioural interpretation. \n\nRegarding data acquisition and analysis, a variety of scanners and sequences were used in each study. There was variation in acquisition and echo time, number and thickness of slices, resolution and analysis software. All of these are documented in Supplementary Table 3 for reference. Only two potential confounders were available for statistical analysis, scanner strength and placebo condition, though meta-regression and comparison with heterogeneity and mean maps did not suggest any significant effects on our results. \n\nThe most important limitation to our method was the exclusion of over half of the studies. We felt this to be an essential step after identification of the positive effect-size bias in published coordinate-based data. The main peaks of the omnibus analysis (text coordinates and group maps) are reported in Supplementary Table 4 for reference. Secondly, because we found such a large number of significant peaks, we could not report all the data generated by this meta-analysis and applied a very conservative threshold. Subsequently, on the one hand, we feel our results are extremely robust, but on the other, many regions which may be of interest are not discussed. However, all these data are recorded in the Supplementary Table 5. \n\nIn terms of the between-group linear model comparison of AWAN and ALAN, there was a difference in gender proportion between AWAN (78%) and ALAN (71%), though this effect just fails to achieve nominal significance (\u03c72 (1)\u2009=\u20093.34,   p  \u2009=\u20090.07). However, 10 of the 15 studies (  n  \u2009=\u2009194) for which we received group maps, sent both AWAN and ALAN contrasts, such that the majority of the data was repeated-measures within-group, strengthening the results. \n\nFinally, the brain atlas used for anatomical location, while strong on detail, is based on the dissection of a single 24\u00a0year old male brain and does not cover the cerebellum necessitating additional use of the Tailarach Daemon. \n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this image-based meta-analysis uses data from a large sample of healthy individuals and reveals robust engagement of brain areas that have previously been linked to the anticipation of reward as well as novel brain areas, providing a definitive map of the reward anticipation network in the healthy human brain. \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6327084,"text_md5":"ecb9173c2dd53d622e60f9de9bf72085","field_positions":{"authors":[0,141],"journal":[142,158],"publication_year":[160,164],"title":[175,299],"keywords":[313,400],"abstract":[413,1527],"body":[1536,38802]},"batch":2,"pmid":30255220,"doi":"10.1007\/s11065-018-9385-5","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6327084","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6327084"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6327084\">6327084<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6327084  The Neural Substrate of Reward Anticipation in Health: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Findings in the Monetary Incentive Delay Task"}

Neuroimaging research has revealed that stopping actions and thoughts engage similar cortical mechanisms, including the ventro- and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. However, whether and how these abilities require similar subcortical mechanisms remains unexplored. Specifically of interest are the basal ganglia, subcortical structures long-known for their motor functions, but less so for their role in cognition. To investigate the potential common mechanisms in the basal ganglia underlying action and thought stopping, we conducted meta-analyses using fMRI data from the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks. All three tasks require active stopping of prepotent actions or thoughts. To localise basal ganglia activations, we performed high-resolution manual segmentations of striatal subregions. We found that all three tasks recovered clusters in the basal ganglia, although the specific localisation of these clusters differed. Although the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks are often interchangeably used for measuring action stopping, their cluster locations in the basal ganglia did not significantly overlap. These different localised clusters suggest that the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks may recruit distinct basal ganglia stopping processes, and therefore should not be treated equivalently. More importantly, the basal ganglia cluster recovered from the Think\/No-Think task largely co-localised with that from the Stop-signal task, but not the Go\/No-Go task, possibly indicating that the Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal tasks share a common striatal circuitry involved in the cancellation of unwanted thoughts and actions. The greater similarity of the Think\/No-Think task to the Stop-Signal rather than Go\/No-Go task also was echoed at the cortical level, which revealed highly overlapping and largely right lateralized set of regions including the anterior DLPFC, VLPFC, Pre-SMA and ACC. Overall, we provide novel evidence suggesting not only that the basal ganglia are critical for thought stopping, but also that they are involved in specific stopping subprocesses that can be engaged by tasks in different domains. These findings raise the possibility that the basal ganglia may be part of a supramodal network responsible for stopping unwanted processes more broadly. \n   Highlights  \n  \nStopping actions and thoughts both consistently activate the basal ganglia. \n  \nAction prevention and action cancellation engage distinct basal ganglia processes. \n  \nThought stopping co-localises with action cancellation, but not prevention. \n  \nBasal ganglia may support a supramodal process cancellation mechanism. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBeing able to stop actions and thoughts is fundamental to goal-directed behaviour. Much research has sought to understand how people stop prepotent responses when needed, a process known as inhibitory control. Although research on inhibitory control has often focused on stopping motor actions, there has also been significant interest in how people stop higher-level cognitive processes, such as memory retrieval. Recent evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that inhibiting motor actions and memory retrieval may engage similar cortical mechanisms, and that a supramodal inhibition mechanism may be supported in part by the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC, VLPFC;  ). Although there have been previous meta-analyses on the common activations across motor inhibition tasks ( ,  ,  ), no studies have examined whether memory inhibition consistently activates similar regions. In addition, previous studies usually focused analyses on the cortical level. In the case of motor inhibition, subcortical mechanisms are known to contribute significantly, particularly the basal ganglia ( ;  ). Moreover, whether and how the basal ganglia are engaged in memory inhibition remains unknown. Here we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis to examine the basal ganglia contribution to both memory and motor inhibition, with a particular emphasis on how people stop retrieval. Moreover, we consider whether scrutinising the specific localisation of domain-specific activations in the basal ganglia might contribute to our understanding of the roles of the basal ganglia in inhibiting memories and actions. \n\nThe basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei with a well-established role in motor inhibition ( ,  ,  ). Studies from the animal literature have identified three coordinating pathways in the basal ganglia that contribute to the different processes in motor control: the hyperdirect, direct, and indirect pathways ( ; Nambu et al., 2002). The hyperdirect pathway has two primary roles ( ): first, it globally inhibits all motor responses to prevent unnecessary movements from taking place prior to movement onset and second, it engages an early selection process that implicitly determines the ideal goal-directed motor response. Following the hyperdirect pathway, the direct pathway initiates the selected motor response. Finally, the indirect pathway terminates the selected motor response either when it is achieved or when it needs to be cancelled ( ). Cancellation of an ongoing motor response may be required when the course of the movement needs to be adjusted due to sensory feedback ( ), or when the movement needs to be completely revoked due to altered task goals, such as when a stop signal is delivered in a stop-signal task. \n\nThe foregoing observations support the idea that the basal ganglia are indispensable for motor inhibition, and that the hyperdirect and indirect pathways are particularly relevant. Whereas the indirect pathway involves cortical input to the striatum, which relays signals to the external globus pallidus (GPe), the subthalamic nuclei (STN), and output via the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the hyperdirect pathway instead involves direct cortical input to the STN and output through the GPi\/SNr. Critically, human neuroimaging studies of motor inhibition have provided converging evidence for the importance of basal ganglia structures, such as the STN ( ). However, no effort has yet been made to characterise the specific regions within the basal ganglia that are consistently recruited by motor inhibition in humans. In this paper, we address this objective with a meta-analytic approach, which provides quantitative inference of the spatial reliability of activations reported across multiple neuroimaging experiments. To localise the clusters of activation observed at the meta-analytic level, we performed high-resolution manual segmentation of basal ganglia sub-regions. \n\nAlthough basal ganglia mechanisms are clearly essential for motor inhibition, it is unclear to what extent they are dedicated to motor inhibition per se. It is possible, for example, that some functions performed by the basal ganglia during stopping may apply more broadly to higher-order cognitive processes ( ,  ). Both patient and neuroimaging studies suggest that at least some high-level cognitive functions are supported by the basal ganglia. For example, patients with basal ganglia impairments such as Parkinson's disease develop deficits in cognitive functions including executive functions and working memory, on top of their motor deficits ( ). In addition, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) consistently show dysfunctions in the frontostriatal network, usually associated with the cognitive control of attention and executive functions ( ,  ). Neuroimaging studies with healthy participants also suggest that the basal ganglia are similarly involved in cognitive functions such as working memory gating ( ). These findings support the possibility that the basal ganglia are involved in control in general, and thus may play a supramodal role in the inhibitory control of both motor and cognitive processes. Alternatively, the basal ganglia could support distinct, modality-dependent stopping mechanisms that stop motor and cognitive processes ( ). The current meta-analysis thus examines the existing literature and delineates whether memory and motor inhibition yield shared or anatomically dissociated subregions of the basal ganglia. \n\nIn addition to localising consistent basal ganglia activations, the current meta-analysis may also help to deduce cortical regions contributing to basal ganglia involvement during inhibitory control. Different subregions in the basal ganglia receive largely topographical projections from cortical areas with different functional roles ( ,  ,  ,  ). For example,   traced corticostriatal projections in macaque monkeys from regions associated with different functions, such as the DLPFC (executive functions) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC; reward processing). Haber et al. found that DLPFC projects to dorsal striatum, including the caudate nucleus, spanning across the internal capsule to medial putamen. The caudate targets were largely in the caudate head, ranging into the caudate body, whereas the putamen targets were almost exclusively rostral to the anterior commissure. In contrast, Haber found that the VMPFC projects primarily to ventral striatum. Similar pathways may exist in humans ( ). These observations may be important because of evidence that DLPFC plays an essential role in supramodal inhibitory control over multiple task domains, including cognition, emotion, and motor action ( ). Hence the DLPFC-striatum pathway demonstrated by   could be a candidate through which both memory and motor inhibition are achieved. It is therefore necessary to segment striatal subregions to localise meta-analytic activation clusters in the basal ganglia, including the caudate head, body, and tail sections, and the putamen. This localisation could help us to ascertain whether both memory and motor inhibition engage a DLPFC-striatum pathway and, if so, whether striatal activations are similarly localised. \n\nTo address the preceding objectives, we conducted quantitative meta-analyses of brain activations from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of motor and memory inhibition, including the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks ( ). In a typical Go\/No-Go task, participants are presented with visual stimuli, such as red and green circles. When they see some stimuli (e.g., green circles), they need to respond with a motor action, such as pressing a button (known as Go trials). In contrast, upon encountering other stimuli (e.g., red circles), they need to refrain from making any motor responses at all (No-Go trials). The procedure ensures that go trials are much more frequent than No-Go trials so that participants get into the habit of making the button press response. A typical Stop-signal task is similar to the Go\/No-Go task. Participants also need to view visually presented stimuli and either carry out a motor response on a Go trial or stop a motor response on a Stop trial. However, in the Stop-signal task, all stimuli represent Go trials, except when an independent stop signal (e.g., an auditory tone) is presented sometime after stimulus onset, signalling the participant to stop. Taking the coloured circles example, participants need to respond to both the blue and green circles, except when a \u2018beep\u2019 tone is played shortly after either a blue or a green circle appears, indicating that they need to cancel the motor response. The Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks are often treated equivalently in the literature ( ,  ), although this might not be the case for reasons we will discuss shortly. Finally, the Think\/No-Think task requires participants to stop a cognitive operation, namely, memory retrieval. In a typical Think\/No-Think task, participants first learn cue-target associations, such as word pairs ( ), word-object pairs ( ), or object-scene pairs ( ). In the subsequent Think\/No-Think phase, each trial presents one cue from one of the pairs. Upon seeing the cues, participants need to either recall the corresponding target to the presented cue if it appears in green (Think trial) or to refrain from recalling the target if the cue appears in red (No-Think trial). A surprise cued-recall test is given at the end of the experiment to measure how recall performance was influenced by retrieving the associated items (Think condition) or by inhibiting their retrieval (No-Think). To measure these effects, recall of Think and No-Think pairs is compared to recall for baseline pairs that were also learned initially, but that were omitted from the Think\/No-Think phase.   \n Typical Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think Paradigms and the Hypothesised Inhibitory Control Processes  . In the hypothesised inhibitory control process panel, the arrows denote the time-flow within a single trial. The colour green represents the respond processes, the red \u201cX\u201d represents when inhibitory control is putatively engaged in the trial, and the grey represents the inhibited processes. On a Go or Think trial, participants would carry out the motor response or memory retrieval, respectively. On an inhibit trial, if prevention processes are engaged, inhibitory control should be effective from the very beginning of the trial, before the corresponding response is even started. If cancellation processes are engaged, inhibitory control would be recruited only to terminate an initiated response. In the lower right, the uncertain positioning of the \u201cX\u201d indicates that we do not know whether prevention or cancellation may be more important for the Think\/No-Think task. \n  Fig. 1.1   \n\nAll three of the foregoing tasks share the feature of having to stop an active process in either the memory or the motor domain. These tasks thus provide the opportunity to investigate the possibility that a supramodal inhibitory control mechanism contributes to stopping processes in general. If so, the meta-analytic clustering observed in each task may co-localise in the basal ganglia. However, each task may also engage different sub-processes through which stopping is achieved. For example, for motor inhibition,   defined two different forms of stopping required by the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks. On one hand, the Go\/No-Go task potentially allows participants to prevent a motor response before it is even initiated: upon recognising a No-Go stimulus, participants could decide not to prepare for a movement, and hence prevent any motor response entirely. On the other hand, the Stop-signal task presents the stop-signal after the cue stimulus appears. Because of this delay in stop-signal onset, participants have likely initiated preparation or execution of the motor response, requiring them to cancel the action. It is unclear whether these different demands (prevention versus cancellation) engage distinct sub-processes that are implemented by different mechanisms within the basal ganglia, such as the hyperdirect pathway for action prevention, and the indirect pathway for action cancellation. For example, whereas   suggested that the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks have a similar anatomical basis but distinct neuropharmacological underpinnings,   argued that the tasks engage different brain regions due to the different sub-processes. Specifically, according to Dalley et al. stop-signal tasks primarily activate the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), whereas Go\/No-Go tasks activate the left IFG. Within the basal ganglia, the specific regions involved in different tasks or sub-processes remain unresolved, although recent studies have emphasised the role of the STN in the stop-signal task ( ). The current meta-analysis would therefore be invaluable for examining both whether and how the basal ganglia contribute to different motor inhibition sub-processes. If domain- or sub-process-specific mechanisms are engaged during action prevention and cancellation, the meta-analytic clusters observed in each task may rely on anatomically distinct subregions of the basal ganglia. One possibility, for example, is that Go\/No-Go activations may be left lateralised, whereas Stop-signal activations could be right-lateralised, mirroring Dalley's lateralisation proposal for prefrontal cortical involvement in these tasks. \n\nUnlike motor inhibition, there have been no formal studies of whether the basal ganglia consistently contribute to memory inhibition. We therefore used this meta-analysis to examine basal ganglia activations during the Think\/No-Think task, and to compare any findings to activations observed during the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks. If memory inhibition engaged the basal ganglia, it is unclear which motor inhibition task it might most resemble (see  , lower right panel). On one hand, the Think\/No-Think task is procedurally similar to the Go\/No-Go task because participants are cued to either engage memory retrieval or to stop it, depending on the stimulus presented. On the other hand, the sub-processes required by the Think\/No-Think task may instead resemble those engaged by the Stop-signal task. Although the colour of the stimulus instructs participants (on No-Think trials) to prevent the target from being recalled (potentially before the retrieval process gets underway), this attempt at retrieval prevention often fails initially; thus the target memory often intrudes into awareness ( ). It is possible that overcoming intrusions requires the cancellation of an ongoing retrieval process, making the No-Think task potentially similar to the Stop-signal task. To examine this possibility,   asked participants to report whether the target had intruded after each No-Think trial, and found that, indeed, overcoming an intrusion induced larger hippocampal down-regulation than did preventing an intrusion. In addition,   found that overcoming intrusions triggered greater inhibitory modulation of the hippocampus by the DLPFC. Moreover, similar to cancelling motor actions, inhibiting memory retrieval in the Think\/No-Think task primarily recruits right lateral prefrontal cortex ( ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Think\/No-Think task engages stopping processes that may be better described as cancellation than prevention. To examine whether memory inhibition requires a sub-process more similar to prevention or cancellation, this meta-analysis will assess whether reported activations across 16 fMRI studies reliably cluster in the basal ganglia, and moreover, how the spatial localisation of any such clusters relate to those observed in the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks. Finally, if basal ganglia clusters are reliable across all three tasks, we will also examine their spatial overlap with conjunction analyses. \n\nTo examine the inhibitory control mechanisms in the basal ganglia in memory and motor inhibition, we compared meta-analytic activations both qualitatively by localising the clusters to specific basal ganglia structures, and quantitatively by computing conjunction and contrast maps between tasks. This coordinate-based meta-analysis approach is convenient for illustrating common activations across studies and task modalities. Nevertheless, this analysis method is, by design, more sensitive to spatially clustered activations than it is to activations that are more dispersed. Thus, if a given task does not yield significant activations in a region, by this analysis, it could either be because few activations occurred in that structure across studies, or instead because the activations were spatially dispersed. To distinguish these possibilities, we therefore subsequently visualised the activation foci in the basal ganglia, and computed descriptive summary statistics from the visualised data. These descriptive results give an impression of the dispersion of basal ganglia activations in each of the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks, and with that, provide clues as to whether an absence of significant activation clusters from the meta-analysis of a given task is driven by the absence of activity in the basal ganglia, or instead by a lack of clustered activity. \n\nTo characterise the specific localisation of basal ganglia activations, we manually segmented the caudate head, body, tail, and putamen subregions of the striatum, as existing atlases either do not have these subregions available, or have imprecise segmentations. For the other fine nuclei in the basal ganglia, we used an existing ultra-high resolution basal ganglia atlas ( ). As suggested by previous findings, we hypothesised that if a supramodal inhibition mechanism existed in the basal ganglia, the task-induced clusters should overlap extensively with each other, possibly in the caudate head and anterior putamen that receive projections from the DLPFC ( ). However, if inhibitory control is achieved in a domain-specific or process-specific fashion, the basal ganglia clusters may be distinct across tasks. Specifically, if basal ganglia involvement is domain-specific, there should be co-localised clusters between the motor inhibition tasks (i.e. Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal), which differ spatially from clusters observed in the memory inhibition task (i.e. Think\/No-Think). However, if basal ganglia involvement is process-specific, there should be co-localised clusters in tasks requiring cancellation of ongoing cognitive or motor operations (i.e. Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal), which differ spatially from clusters observed in the task that primarily engages prevention of motor responses (i.e. Go\/No-Go). If this pattern is observed, it would raise the possibility of a supramodal basal ganglia contribution to the cancellation of both actions and thoughts. Finally, it was also of interest to examine whether the STN is engaged by the memory and motor inhibition tasks, or whether STN activation is specific to certain tasks or processes. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Selection criteria and the meta-analytic approach \n  \nStudies using the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks were selected for the motor inhibition meta-analyses, whereas studies using the Think\/No-Think task were selected for the memory inhibition meta-analysis. For the motor inhibition meta-analyses, we first identified studies from existing ALE meta-analyses ( ,  ,  ). We then searched for additional studies that were published after the above meta-analyses through Google Scholar, using the key words \u201cStop-signal task\u201d and \u201cGo\/No-Go task\u201d, respectively. For the memory inhibition analysis, we included all published Think\/No-Think studies, and two additional studies from the laboratory of the last author that are being prepared for publication. These searches resulted in 46 Stop-signal studies, 38 Go\/No-Go studies, and 16 Think\/No-Think studies. We further screened these studies according to the following criteria:   \nOnly fMRI studies reporting results from whole brain analyses in a standardised coordinate space (MNI or Talairach) were included; \n  \nOnly data from healthy adults were included; \n  \nOnly Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go tasks where participants responded by hand were included; \n  \nOnly contrasts concerning differences between inhibition and an active condition were included, i.e. No-Think>Think, Stop>Go, and No-Go>Go. We requested the relevant data from each author if they were not already reported in the original article. \n  \n\nAccording to these criteria, 16 Think\/No-Think, 39 Stop-signal, and 30 Go\/No-Go studies were identified ( ) and included in the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses were conducted using Activation Likelihood Estimation with GingerALE v2.3.6 ( ,  ,  ,  ). The following default settings were applied: less conservative mask size; non-additive ALE method ( ); no additional FWHM; cluster analysis peaks at all extrema. Where applicable, coordinates reported in Talairach space in the original studies were transformed into MNI space using the icbm2tal transform in GingerALE ( ,  ) prior to the analyses. \n\nThe first step of the meta-analytic approach is to examine the spatial convergence across different studies within each task domain. To do this, three separate meta-analyses were conducted for the Think\/No-Think, Stop-signal, and Go\/No-Go tasks using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, cluster-forming threshold uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). Secondly, to examine the spatial convergence and divergence between different task domains, contrast analyses ( ) were conducted between each pair of the Think\/No-Think, Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go Tasks (i.e., Think\/No-Think & Stop-signal; Think\/No-Think & Go\/No-Go; Stop-signal & Go\/No-Go). For analysing each pair of the tasks, the thresholded activation maps from the individual analyses, as well as the pooled results from both tasks were used as inputs. The outputs were conjunction and contrast maps between the conditions. The same GingerALE settings were applied to the contrast analyses (less conservative mask size; non-additive ALE method; no additional FWHM; cluster analysis peaks at all extrema.). The results were thresholded to voxel-wise uncorrected   p  <.001, with the   p  -value permutations of 10,000 iterations, and the minimum cluster volume of 200\u00a0mm . We present results from all conjunction and contrast analyses between each pair of the tasks. \n\nThe ALE analysis is a whole-brain analysis, and we report both cortical and subcortical findings. However, given the conceptual focus on the role of the basal ganglia in memory and motor inhibition, we accordingly focus our consideration of our results on the basal ganglia. In addition to the meta-analytic results, to give an impression of the activation peaks from the included studies, we display their peak coordinates on 3D renders of the basal ganglia. By definition, the ALE analyses are sensitive to common clusters of activation across studies. Activation peaks that are more spatially dispersed, either because a particular cognitive function is not associated with localised activation, or because the included studies are few in number, might therefore not be detected as common across studies. We therefore also counted the number of coordinates that were located in the basal ganglia in the left and right hemispheres. Together, the peak coordinates and their counts serve to provide a comprehensive descriptive picture of the meta-analytic data that the ALE results are based on. We report this information at the end of the results section. \n\n\n### Basal ganglia ROI definition \n  \nTo examine how clusters recovered from the meta-analyses of the memory and motor inhibition tasks related to the subregional anatomy of the basal ganglia, we projected the clusters onto 3D renderings of the subregions. These regions of interest (ROIs) in the basal ganglia were defined with both manual segmentation and an existing atlas (Atlasing of the Basal Ganglia; ATAG;  ). Although the ATAG atlas took averages of structural images from ultra-high resolution 7\u00a0T MRI and thus provides very fine details of basal ganglia structures, it only treated the striatum as one single structure. No other existing atlases provided high-resolution parcellations of the relevant striatal subregions. We therefore performed manual segmentation of the striatal subregions, including bilateral caudate head, body, tail, and putamen, according to established anatomy and segmentation protocols ( ;  ;  ; segmentation guidelines provided by the Centre for Morphometric Analysis (CMA;  ). The segmentations were performed using ITK-SNAP v3.2 ( ;  ) from the high-resolution ICBM 2009b template structural image (.5\u00a0mm isotropic;  ,  ). Together, these segmentations of the human caudate and putamen improve upon the anatomical precision of several widely used atlases, such as Anatomical Automatic Labelling in SPM (AAL;  ) and Atlasing of the Basal Ganglia (ATAG).   compares our segmentation with these atlases. The resulting subcortical clusters are projected onto the 3D rendering of the segmented structures using Mango v4.0 (Lancaster & Martinez;  ).   \n Segmentation of the striatal subregions  . The three columns compare the AAL and ATAG atlases with our manual segmentation.

The relevant structures are labelled, and the differences are marked with black circles. Anatomical underlay and subcortical renders are displayed in MNI space. \n  Fig. 2.1   \n\n#### Segmentation protocols for the striatal subregions \n  \n##### Caudate head \n  \nThe head of the caudate was segmented through the coronal plane, starting from the slice where it first appears in between the lateral boundaries of the lateral ventricle and the internal capsule, ending at the posterior edge of the anterior commissure, cutting in the middle of the interventricular foramen of Monroe across the frontoparietal axis ( ,  ,  ). Care was taken not to include the sheet of meninges between the lateral ventricle and the caudate. \n\nThe nucleus accumbens was excluded from the caudate head following guidelines provided by the Centre for Morphometric Analysis (CMA) for creating the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Atlas ( ). See   for an example of this parcellation error in the AAL. \n\n\n##### Caudate body \n  \nThe body of the caudate was segmented through the coronal plane, starting from the posterior edge of the anterior commissure until the slice where the cerebral aqueduct enlarges to form the opening of the fourth ventricle ( ,  ). The dorsal and ventral boundaries of the caudate body were refined in the sagittal plane, following the lateral ventricle and the internal capsule. \n\n\n##### Caudate tail \n  \nThe tail of the caudate started from the coronal slice containing the opening of the fourth ventricle, and was followed until it curved around the thalamus in the sagittal plane. The rest of the tail was traced cross-referencing the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes until it reaches the amygdala. \n\n\n##### Putamen \n  \nThe putamen was traced through the coronal plane, starting from the slice where it first shows up lateral to the internal capsule, surrounded by the other white matter tissues, and ending when it is no longer seen. Care was taken not to include blood vessels inferior to the putamen, the claustrum lateral to the putamen, or white matter tracts posterior to the putamen. \n\nThe nucleus accumbens was segmented out from the putamen when the internal capsule no longer separates the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Existing pipelines usually draw arbitrary lines to segment between the putamen and the accumbens, such as drawing a straight vertical line downwards from the lateral inferior tip of the internal capsule as suggested by the CMA guidelines. This is possibly due to the lower resolution of the structural image used in those segmentations. However, the anatomical boundaries between the putamen and the nucleus accumbens in the ICBM 2009b structural template are clearly more visible, and hence are directly used as references for segmentation. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOn the whole, the ALE meta-analyses revealed both cortical and subcortical clusters in the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks. \n\n### Cortical activations across the three tasks \n  \nAlthough the current effort emphasizes the role of the basal ganglia in stopping behaviour, we first briefly characterize cortical activations. Notably, although other GingerALE meta-analyses of motor response inhibition already have been published (e.g.  ;  ;  ), the current analysis is the first to be published since the identification and correction of significant algorithmic bugs in the method used to correct for multiple comparisons that led to inadvertently liberal statistical thresholds being adopted ( ). The current activation maps therefore may be more circumscribed than those that have been previously reported owing to the newly corrected statistical corrections adopted. \n\nAs can be seen in  , on the cortical level, preventing motor actions (Go\/No-Go task) activated bilateral DLPFC and the right VLPFC, as well as regions in the right parietal lobes. Cancelling motor actions (Stop-signal task), on the other hand, activated the right DLPFC, VLPFC, and precentral gyrus. Action cancellation also activated bilateral insula, temporal and parietal regions, the cingulate gyrus and preSMA. These findings are generally consistent with those reported in previous meta-analyses ( ,  ,  ), with several notable exceptions. First, Go-No-Go activations were less extensive than in prior reports ( ) and did not include activation in either the left or right insula or left IFG. Second, although there was greater overall agreement between the current findings and those of  , our Stop-Signal analysis did not reveal activation in left DLPFC or frontal polar cortex. This difference may be attributable, however, to Cai et al.\u2019s mixing of Stop-Signal and Go-No-Go studies into a common analysis, a possibility supported by presence of those missing activations in our Go-No-Go task analysis. These results were generated using cluster-level inference (p<.05, uncorrected p<.001, threshold permutations=1000). The cortical analysis also revealed that the Think\/No-Think task activated the right DLPFC, VLPFC, cingulate gyrus, precentral gyrus, and the parietal lobe (including supramarginal\/angular gyrus and intraparietal sulcus), as well as the left insula and supramarginal gyrus. The similarity of these activations to those observed in motor action stopping suggest the possible existence of domain-general cortical regions that contribute to memory and motor stopping, as suggested in prior work ( ,  ). Indeed, all of the tasks activated the right DLPFC, VLPFC, and supramarginal\/angular gyrus, in the right hemisphere.   \n Cortical activations from the task-specific meta-analyses.   All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.1   \n\nTo determine whether the foregoing characterizations of cross-task commonalities accurately represent inter-task relationships, we conducted a formal conjunction analysis. As can be seen in  , action prevention (Go\/No-Go) and Action Cancellation (Stop-Signal) tasks shared limited right lateralized activations in the right anterior DLPFC and the Supramarginal\/Angular Gyrus. The existence of overlapping activations suggests that some elements of motor action cancellation and motor action prevention are shared, as one might expect, based on their classification as action stopping tasks. More interesting, however, was the differing relationship between memory inhibition (the Think\/No-Think task) and the two motor response inhibition tasks. Whereas activations observed for memory inhibition overlapped extensively with action cancellation (Stop-signal task), overlap was more limited with action prevention (Go\/No-Go). Specifically, action cancellation and memory inhibition shared right lateralized activations in the anterior DLPFC, posterior MFG, VLPFC, Insula, Angular\/Supramarginal gyrus, Intraparietal Sulcus, Pre-SMA, and anterior cingulate. In contrast, action prevention and memory inhibition only shared activation in right angular\/supramarginal gyrus and a very small region in right middle frontal gyrus that did not overlap with the region shared with action cancellation. These findings suggest that despite broad similarities of all three tasks in the involvement of right lateral prefrontal cortex, the spatial localisation of shared activations may provide additional information about the relative similarities between tasks. These data are consistent with the possibility that memory inhibition, at the cortical level, may have more in common with action cancellation than with action prevention.   \n Cross-task conjunction analysis.   All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.2   \n\n\n### Subcortical activations across the three tasks \n  \nOn the subcortical level, all three tasks produced reliable clusters in the basal ganglia, suggesting that the basal ganglia are involved in both memory and motor inhibition and may be part of a supramodal network of inhibitory control. By qualitatively comparing the ALE results, we found a task-specific hemispheric asymmetry in the location of basal ganglia clusters. Specifically, significant activation clustering was localised to the left hemisphere for action prevention (Go\/No-Go) task, whereas significant activation clustering was localised to the right hemisphere for action cancellation (Stop-signal) and memory inhibition (Think\/No-Think) tasks. The following results sections will elaborate on findings in the basal ganglia. For a summary of all the basal ganglia results from the task-specific, conjunction, and contrast analyses, please see section 3.3. \n\n#### Comparing the cancellation and prevention of motor actions \n  \nOn the whole, our analyses indicated that both action cancellation and prevention yielded clusters of activation in the basal ganglia. However, action cancellation yielded more spatially extensive clusters, which scarcely overlapped with the clusters from action prevention. The largely distinct localisation of basal ganglia clusters suggests that action cancellation and action prevention may engage distinct stopping processes that should not be assumed to be equivalent. This section illustrates these findings by detailing and comparing the clusters from the Stop-signal (cancellation) and Go\/No-Go (prevention) tasks. \n\n##### Action cancellation engaged right basal ganglia structures \n  \nAcross the 39 Stop-signal studies included in the analysis, cancelling a motor action yielded a consistent cluster in the right basal ganglia ( ). First, cancelling a motor action is associated with a cluster in the right centromedial striatum, primarily in the caudate head, spanning into the caudate body and the right anteromedial putamen. This cluster also extended to the right anterior GPe. Visual inspection suggests that the localisation of this cluster may coincide with the putative homologue of the region that receives DLPFC projections identified in the monkey literature ( ), a possibility consistent with the clear DLPFC activation observed during action cancellation in our cortical findings ( ). Second, significant clusters were also observed in the bilateral STN and left SN. The STN finding is compatible with the significant action cancellation role consistently attributed to this structure in previous literature ( ). The SN activations are compatible with the dopaminergic modulation that is required by basal ganglia control mechanisms ( ). However, these activations from the STN and SN should be interpreted cautiously, as they are small in size and are neighboured by other subcortical nuclei, and our functional resolution is only as good as that of the ALE result maps. Thus, the reported activations may be driven by effects in neighbouring structures. Finally, cancelling a motor action also yielded a cluster in the ventral thalamus. The ventral thalamus is downstream to the basal ganglia and is specifically implicated in motor processes ( ).   \n Basal ganglia activation for action cancellation.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Middle row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellaions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra (SN). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.3   \n\n\n##### Action prevention reliably activated left putamen and GPe, but not caudate \n  \nAcross the 30 Go\/No-Go studies included in the analysis, preventing a motor action yielded a cluster in the left basal ganglia, including anterior putamen, spanning into anterior GPe, only touching on the medial wall of the caudate head ( ). The putamen involvement aligns with classic models of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit for motor control ( ). However, the absence of a caudate cluster during action prevention, as compared to action cancellation, suggests that these motor inhibition tasks may place different demands on neural mechanisms in the basal ganglia.   \n Basal ganglia activation for action prevention.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.4   \n\n\n##### Action cancellation and prevention showed no significant co-localisation in the basal ganglia \n  \nFrom the meta-analyses of individual task types, it is striking that action cancellation and prevention shared so few clusters in the basal ganglia, given that the Stop-signal and the Go\/No-Go tasks are often used interchangeably to measure response inhibition. To formally test whether action cancellation and action prevention engaged similar basal ganglia structures, we computed a conjunction analysis between the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks. No overlapping clusters were identified in the basal ganglia at the current threshold, although subthreshold clustering might exist in the Go\/No-Go task (see contrast analysis in 3.2.1.4). It is unlikely that this lack of similarity between these tasks within the basal ganglia arises from insufficient statistical power, given the large number of studies included in the analysis. To the extent that interactions between cortical and basal ganglia structures are considered critical to the character of the stopping mechanism, these findings suggest that overlap at the cortical level between the Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go tasks ( ) may not imply a common mechanism of action stopping. \n\nSome have suggested that putative differences between the two tasks may be due to the variations in the administration of the Go\/No-Go task ( ). Typically, the prepotency of the to-be-stopped motor response in the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks is created by having frequent Go trials and infrequent No-Go or Stop trials ( ). However, some Go\/No-Go studies have had equiprobable Go and No-Go trials, making the prepotency of the motor responses uncertain, and possibly undermining the necessity of inhibitory control. This is unlikely to be the case in our analysis, as only 9 out of 30 Go\/No-Go studies used an equiprobable design, and another 2 with varying frequency of No-Go trials in different blocks of their task phase. The limited number of studies should not exert a strong influence on the results ( ,  ). To confirm this, we conducted a control meta-analysis including only Go\/No-Go studies with infrequent No-Go trials (N=19), which revealed an identical cluster of activation in the left basal ganglia as the one reported in the original Go\/No-Go meta-analysis (see  ). We then re-ran the conjunction between the Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go tasks using the modified Go\/No-Go sample (N=19). Again, we found no significant basal ganglia co-localisation of clusters between tasks. Hence, the null conjunction effect cannot be attributed to variation of prepotency in the Go\/No-Go task. \n\n\n##### Action cancellation engaged the STN and SN significantly more than action prevention \n  \nVisual comparison of the clusters yielded by the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks suggests that action cancellation engages both STN and SN, but that action prevention does not. To determine whether these differences are reliable, we computed a contrast analysis between the Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go tasks. The results confirmed significantly greater clustered activation during action cancellation in bilateral STN and the left SN than during action prevention ( ), indicating a robust difference between the two stopping processes. However, as previously mentioned, these results should be interpreted cautiously given the small size of these nuclei and the possibility that the smoothed data might be influenced by activation in adjacent structures. Although in the task-specific meta-analyses action cancellation yielded clusters in the right caudate and action prevention did not, this observed difference was not statistically significant in the direct contrast analysis. This finding suggests that conclusions about the lack of right caudate involvement in action prevention should be tempered until firmer evidence of differential engagement across cancellation and prevention is clearly established (see   for data indicating that this observed difference in caudate involvement is better described as a difference in the spatial dispersion (clustering) of reported activation coordinates, as opposed to an absolute absence of reported coordinates per se).   \n Action cancellation reliably engaged STN and SN more than action prevention.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellaions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra (SN). The contrast analysis was computed using the thresholded ALE images from the individual analyses. All clusters are thresholded at uncorrected   p  <.001, with the   p  -value permutations of 10,000 iterations, and the minimum cluster volume of 200\u00a0mm . \n  Fig. 3.5   \n\n\n##### Action cancellation engaged the basal ganglia more extensively than action prevention \n  \nAs mentioned previously, we observed significant clustering in the right striatum and GPe, bilateral STN, and left SN in the action cancellation task. By contrast, significant clustering was limited to the left striatum and GPe in the action prevention task. To quantify the extensiveness of basal ganglia clusters yielded by these tasks, we compared the total volumes of the clusters from the task-specific analyses. At our current threshold (cluster-level inference p<.05, uncorrected p<.001, threshold permutations=1000), cancelling a motor action yielded more extensive basal ganglia activation clusters overall (1120\u00a0mm  in the right hemisphere and 216\u00a0mm  in the left hemisphere) than preventing a motor action (864\u00a0mm  in the left alone). \n\n\n\n#### Comparing memory and motor inhibition \n  \nOverall, our analysis revealed that memory inhibition yielded consistent activation clusters in the right basal ganglia, but not in the left. Importantly, when we compared the basal ganglia activation clusters observed for memory and motor inhibition, we found that memory inhibition yielded clusters that were highly similar to those involved in action cancellation, but not to those involved in action prevention. This section delineates the basal ganglia clusters observed for memory inhibition, and compares them with those yielded by action cancellation and action prevention. \n\n##### Memory inhibition engaged right caudate, putamen, and GPe \n  \nAcross the 16 Think\/No-Think studies included in the analysis, memory inhibition yielded a significant activation cluster in the right basal ganglia. This cluster was primarily located in the caudate head, spanning into caudate body, anterior putamen, and anterior GPe ( ). This cluster is highly similar to the one yielded by action cancellation in the centromedial striatum. Together with the consistent activation in the DLPFC reported in  , these results suggest that a similar DLPFC-basal ganglia control mechanism may be engaged by both memory inhibition and action cancellation. Memory inhibition yielded a more extensive basal ganglia activation cluster in the right hemisphere (1648\u00a0mm ) than did action cancellation (1120\u00a0mm ).   \n Memory inhibition engaged the right basal ganglia.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.6   \n\n\n##### Memory inhibition and action cancellation engaged right caudate, putamen, and GPe \n  \nTo formally test whether the basal ganglia activation clusters generated by memory inhibition and action cancellation overlapped, we examined the conjunction analysis between the ALE maps for the Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal meta-analyses. Critically, within the basal ganglia, the results demonstrated that both tasks activated the right caudate head\/body, anterormedial putamen, and anterior GPe ( ). Specifically, at the cluster-corrected threshold, the conjunction cluster resulted in an extensive overlap (552\u00a0mm ) with the task-specific Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal basal ganglia clusters, constituting 33% of the basal ganglia cluster volumes activated by memory inhibition, and 49% of those activated by action cancellation in the right hemisphere, or 41% overall. When considered together with the shared cortical activations in the right anterior and posterior DLPFC ( ), these findings suggest that the putative DLPFC-basal ganglia pathway may serve a supramodal inhibitory control function across memory and motor domains.   \n Spatial Co-localisation of memory inhibition and action cancellation in basal ganglia subregions.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.7   \n\n\n##### Memory inhibition and action prevention did not reliably co-localise in the basal ganglia \n  \nIntriguingly, memory inhibition and action prevention did not seem to share basal ganglia activation clusters from the individual maps, as the first yielded a cluster exclusively located in right basal ganglia, and the latter, a cluster exclusively in left basal ganglia. To quantitatively verify this observation, we examined the conjunction analysis between the Think\/No-Think and Go\/No-Go tasks. As suggested by the individual meta-analyses, these tasks did not share common activations in the basal ganglia at our current threshold. As with the stop-signal task, we also examined whether the failure to detect conjunction effects may be due to variation of prepotency in the Go\/No-Go task. This was not the case: when we re-analysed the conjunction between the Think\/No-Think and Go\/No-Go tasks using the modified Go\/No-Go sample (studies with offset ratios of Stop and Go trials; N=19), we were unable to detect significant basal ganglia co-localised clusters between the Think\/No-Think and Go\/No-Go tasks. The lack of shared activations in the basal ganglia accords well with the minimal overlap with action prevention and memory inhibition at the cortical level ( ). These findings suggest that although memory inhibition and action prevention engage moderately overlapping common cortical regions (e.g. right angular gyrus), they seem to recruit distinct processes in the basal ganglia. These findings are consistent with the possibility that memory inhibition in the Think\/No-Think task primarily requires cancellation of memory retrieval. \n\n\n##### Memory inhibition engaged basal ganglia subregions more reliably than motor inhibition \n  \nTo quantify the differences between memory inhibition, action cancellation, and action prevention, we computed contrast analyses between the Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal tasks, and between the Think\/No-Think and Go\/No-Go tasks. Comparing the Think\/No-Think and Stop-signal tasks, although both tasks yielded activation clusters in similar regions in the right basal ganglia, memory inhibition engaged the right anteromedial putamen and anterior GPe more than did action cancellation ( ). This finding is intriguing as the putamen is usually construed as part of the motor circuit ( ). However, recent studies have shown putamen activations thought to reflect the interaction between memory, action and reward ( ), indicating that the putamen is not functionally limited to involvement in motor control tasks. Indeed,   reported evidence for effective connectivity between the putamen and the posterior hippocampus, providing at least one precedent for a potentially important role of the putamen in hippocampal interactions.   \n Memory inhibition engaged putamen and GPe more reliably than action cancellation.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.8   \n\nWhen we compared the Think\/No-Think and Go\/No-Go tasks ( ), memory inhibition engaged more clustered activity in the right anteromedial putamen and anterior GPe than did action prevention. This echoes the contrast between memory inhibition and action cancellation. In addition, memory inhibition yielded stronger evidence of clustered activations in the right caudate head. The caudate is usually construed as part of the executive function circuit ( ;  ). It is possible that inhibiting memory retrieval requires more active control processes especially when intrusions take place, whereas action prevention can be achieved by low-level associative learning.   \n Memory inhibition engaged caudate, putamen, and GPe more reliably than action prevention.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellations of the caudate, putamen, and external globus pallidus (GPe). All clusters are thresholded using cluster-level inference (  p  <.05, uncorrected   p  <.001, threshold permutations=1000). \n  Fig. 3.9   \n\n\n##### Action cancellation engaged STN more reliably than memory inhibition \n  \nWe also examined which regions yielded greater activation clustering during action cancellation than by memory inhibition. Our individual analyses had revealed bilateral STN and left SN activation clusters in action cancellation but not in memory inhibition. To formally test these differences, we computed a contrast analysis between the Stop-signal and Think\/No-Think tasks. Our results revealed that action cancellation yielded reliably greater activation clustering in bilateral STN and ventral thalamus than did memory inhibition ( ). Again, care should be taken in interpreting meta-analytic activations for these fine subcortical structures, as they may be influenced by effects in neighbouring structures.   \n Action cancellation engaged STN more reliably than memory inhibition.   Top row: Clusters are presented on coronal slices of a high-resolution MNI atlas. Reference lines for the coronal slices are presented in the sagittal plane. Bottom row: Clusters are displayed on high-resolution parcellaions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The contrast analysis was computed using the thresholded ALE images from the individual analyses. All clusters are thresholded at uncorrected   p  <.001, with the   p  -value permutations of 10,000 iterations, and the minimum cluster volume of 200\u00a0mm . \n  Fig. 3.10   \n\n\n\n#### Summary of ALE results in the basal ganglia \n  \nThe basal ganglia ALE results are summarised in   ,   including activations from the task-specific, conjunction, and contrast analyses. This summary shows that whereas the Go\/No-Go task primarily engages the left putamen and GPe, the Stop-signal and Think\/No-Think tasks primarily engage the right caudate, putamen, and GPe. In other words, our findings suggest that the cancellation of actions and thoughts engages similar basal ganglia structures, and that these are distinct from the basal ganglia structures engaged in the prevention of actions. This does not necessarily mean that none of the action prevention studies activated the same basal ganglia structures as action cancellation and memory inhibition. However, this does suggest that, if action prevention studies did activate the same structures (in particular, the right basal ganglia), the activation peaks were not sufficiently spatially clustered to be detected with the ALE algorithm. We explore these considerations further in  .   \n Basal ganglia activations in the task-specific, conjunction, and contrast analyses.   The left column shows basal ganglia activations from the task-specific meta-analyses, colour-coded by task contrasts (Blue=Stop>Go, Red=No-Go>Go, and Green=No-Think>Think). The middle column shows the conjunction analyses. Activations shared by two tasks are presented in the mixed colour based on the colours that we used to represent the individual tasks. The right column shows basal ganglia activations from the contrast analyses, with the colours denoting task-specific activity. For example, bilateral STN was activated more strongly in the Stop>Go contrast (blue) than the No-Go>Go and No-Think>Think contrasts. The top panel summarises activations in the left basal ganglia structures, while the bottom panel summaries those in the right. \n  Fig. 3.11   \n\n\n#### Visualisation of basal ganglia activation peaks from the included studies \n  \nBy definition, the ALE analyses are sensitive to common clusters of activation across studies. Activation peaks that are more spatially dispersed, either because a particular cognitive function is not associated with localised activation, or because the included studies are few in number, therefore might not be detected as common across studies. To explore this possibility further, we visualised the spatial distribution of peak activations across studies on 3D renders of the pre-defined basal ganglia ROIs ( ), and counted the number of coordinates located in the left and right basal ganglia ( ). Of particular interest is whether any Go\/No-Go studies activated the right basal ganglia, because we did not find any common clusters in the right basal ganglia across the Go\/No-Go task (action prevention) and either of the other tasks (Stop-signal and Think\/No-Think). Examining the peak coordinates from the basal ganglia activations in the original studies showed that the basal ganglia are indeed activated in all three tasks, and that there are overlaps between the basal ganglia activations from the memory and motor inhibition tasks. However, several novel observations emerge from these summaries. First, although our ALE analysis only revealed significant clusters of activation in the left basal ganglia for the Go\/No-Go task, there are, interestingly, equally many peak coordinates that appear in both the left and right hemispheres. The key difference between the left and right basal ganglia activations seems to be the somewhat greater dispersion of coordinates in the right hemisphere, reducing the apparent clustering. Second, although the ALE analysis only demonstrated significant clusters of activation in the right basal ganglia for the Stop-signal task, there are equally many coordinates in the left and right hemispheres. The coordinates seemed more dispersed in the left hemisphere, again reducing the apparent clustering. Finally, memory inhibition qualitatively appears to be more right lateralised than the other tasks, consistent with the impression offered by ALE. A more precise characterisation of task differences in the spatial distribution of activations across sub-regions is limited by the moderate number of coordinates available in this dataset.   \nPeak coordinates from the basal ganglia activations in the Go\/No-Go, stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks. \n  Fig. 3.12     \nNumber of studies reporting basal ganglia coordinates in the left and right hemispheres from the Go\/No-Go, stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks. \n  Table 3.1   \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current investigation examined the potential existence of common mechanisms in the basal ganglia that underlie the inhibition of actions and thoughts. Although the basal ganglia have an established role in motor inhibition, whether and how this structure is involved in memory inhibition remains unexplored. To address these issues, we conducted a set of meta-analyses using fMRI data from the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks. Whereas the first two tasks require inhibiting motor actions, the last task requires inhibition of episodic memory retrieval. After examining the ALE maps for each task, we computed conjunction and contrast analyses to formally examine the similarities and differences between the locations of significant basal ganglia clusters recovered in each task. Moreover, because the ALE analysis may be more sensitive to spatially clustered than spatially distributed activations, we also examined basal ganglia peak coordinates from the studies included to illustrate the prevalence and dispersion of basal ganglia activations yielded by each task. We localised the observed basal ganglia clusters as precisely as possible by manually segmenting the striatal sub-regions from a high-resolution template brain, including the caudate head, body, and tail, and the putamen. This is the first segmentation to our knowledge that has individual compartments of the striatum at this level of spatial resolution. Our key observations and their implications are discussed below. \n\nOn the cortical level, our motor inhibition meta-analyses resembled prior meta-analytic findings ( ,  ,  ), including activations in the right DLPFC, VLPFC, and angular\/supramarginal gyrus for both Stop-signal and Go\/No-Go tasks. Notably, however, the spatial extent of meta-analytic activations was reduced overall, owing to our use of a corrected version of GingerALE which corrects for multiple comparisons accurately ( ). Moreover, in contrast to prior meta-analyses (e.g.  ) which found evidence for bilateral insula activation in the Go\/No-Go task, we did not. Our memory inhibition meta-analysis also revealed activations in the right DLPFC and VLPFC, in addition to the anterior cingulate cortex, pre-SMA, and right parietal regions. These findings are broadly consistent with the possibility that stopping engages a supramodal cortical network, irrespective of whether one is stopping actions or thoughts. Nevertheless, despite these broad similarities, individual conjunctions between tasks revealed differences in the extent to which memory inhibition shared activations with action prevention versus action cancellation. Whereas memory inhibition shared activations with action cancellation in right anterior and posterior DLPFC, VLPFC, Insula, ACC, Pre-SMA, angular\/supramarginal Gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, it's overlap with motor action prevention was considerably more limited, especially in the right prefrontal cortex. This difference suggests that memory inhibition may engage stopping processes that require cancellation to a greater extent than it requires retrieval prevention. Alternatively, the Go\/No-Go task may simply be less demanding than the other two tasks, yielding less prefrontal activation overall, and correspondingly less possible overlap with action cancellation and memory inhibition. \n\nOn the subcortical level, although we observed basal ganglia clusters in all three tasks, the specific localisation of these clusters differed. Strikingly, the Go\/No-Go and Stop-Signal tasks \u2013 two of the most widely studied forms of motor stopping that are often assumed to engage similar functions \u2013 showed clusters in different basal ganglia regions. Whereas the Go\/No-Go task consistently activated the left anterior putamen (spanning into anterior GPe), the Stop-signal task yielded more extensive right-lateralised spatial clusters of activation mainly in the caudate head\/body, anterodorsal putamen, anterior GPe. A formal conjunction analysis revealed that overlap between the activation clusters observed in these tasks was not statistically significant. These findings hold both when we included all 30 Go\/No-Go studies, and when we excluded those with equiprobable Go and No-Go trials. To ensure that inhibitory processes are taking place, future Go\/No-Go studies should always have infrequent No-Go trials in the design ( ,  ). The differing localisations of these clusters may be very important for two reasons. First, distinct basal ganglia structures constitute different coordinating pathways supporting the prevention, initiation, and termination of motor or cognitive processes ( ,  ,  ). Second, cortical and subcortical structures project topographically to the basal ganglia ( ,  ). Therefore, differently localised activation clusters, such as those observed here, could indicate different computational functions ( ,  ,  ,  ). These observations converge with recent findings suggesting that the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks may differ in important respects, including the underlying cognitive processes engaged ( ,  ), cortical regions recruited ( ), their electrophysiological markers ( ) and neuropharmacological underpinnings ( ). These differences may arise because the Go\/No-Go task primarily requires the prevention of a motor action from taking place, whereas the Stop-signal task requires cancelling an emerging or ongoing motor process. Thus, the current analysis of activation clusters support the view that despite their similarity as motor stopping procedures, these tasks may tap different control processes and should not be treated equivalently. \n\nAfter comparing the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks, we examined whether the basal ganglia were involved in stopping memory retrieval. Interestingly, we found that, like stopping actions, stopping thoughts also engages the basal ganglia. Memory inhibition in the Think\/No-Think showed a consistent cluster of activation in the right caudate head\/body, anterodorsal putamen, and anterior GPe. This cluster of activations was exclusively right lateralised, and was more spatially extensive than the analogous clusters from the motor stopping tasks. This clearly indicates that basal ganglia structures play an important role in stopping retrieval, perhaps akin to its role in stopping actions. This commonality raises the possibility that basal ganglia structures are involved in stopping in a more general way than is usually assumed in research on motor inhibition. A similar supramodal hypothesis was discussed by  , though with a more specific focus on interactions between VLPFC and the subthalamic nucleus, rather than the basal ganglia more broadly. \n\nAlthough both memory and motor inhibition activated the basal ganglia, the pattern of activations in that structure provides converging evidence that memory inhibition in the Think\/No-Think task may be more similar to action cancellation in the Stop-signal task than it is to action prevention in the Go\/No-Go task. Consistent with their strong overlap at the cortical level ( ), our conjunction analysis revealed strong overlap between the activation clusters observed for memory inhibition and action cancellation, including the right caudate head\/body, anterior putamen, and the anterior GPe. Critically, the conjunction cluster between memory inhibition and action cancellation in the right hemisphere constituted 33% of the voxels activated by memory inhibition, and 49% of those activated by action cancellation in the right hemisphere (or 41% when considering both hemispheres). These findings suggest that the particular basal ganglia regions observed here might play a computational role in cancelling a process, irrespective of whether that process involved motor action. Action cancellation, however, did engage bilateral STN and ventral thalamus more reliably than did memory inhibition. It is possible that these regions are uniquely required for cancelling a motor response, as the ventral thalamus is typically construed as the downstream target of the basal ganglia during motor control ( ). The STN is also shown to be integral for cancelling a motor action ( ), although which specific pathway the STN engages (either the hyperdirect or the indirect pathway) remains unresolved. However, given their small size and the lack of attention to these structures in the literature on memory inhibition, their activity during memory inhibition tasks might not have been consistently reported, even if it occurred. Future studies of memory inhibition should specifically examine the role of the STN in this process. More generally, connectivity analyses could be conducted to investigate the network dynamics between the basal ganglia structures to isolate the particular basal ganglia mechanisms underlying the inhibition of memory retrieval. \n\nDespite the foregoing between-task differences in the STN activation clustering, the overall similarity between the clusters observed for memory inhibition and action cancellation in the striatum and GPe suggests that inhibiting thoughts may require active cancellation. This observation argues against the possibility that people prevent retrieval of an unwanted item by simply directing the retrieval process to distracting thoughts, or, instead, by passively failing to engage retrieval. Rather, the recruitment of cancellation-related striatal processes suggests that retrieval is being actively stopped. This interpretation converges with findings indicating that the engagement of inhibitory mechanisms during retrieval stopping is particularly robust when memories intrude into awareness and need to be purged ( ,  ). Using trial-by-trial intrusion reports, it has been found that intrusions elicit greater recruitment of right prefrontal cortex ( ) and greater down-regulation of hippocampal activity ( ), compared to trials without intrusions. The current findings suggest that retrieval cancellation may be key to overcoming intrusions. In contrast, we observed no overlap in activation clusters between memory inhibition and action prevention from the ALE analyses. These findings are consistent with the possibility that different basal ganglia regions contribute to distinct cancellation and prevention-related sub-processes, and that cancellation is not tied uniquely to motor action, but rather may be supramodal. To establish these conclusions more firmly, however, requires that we move beyond mere co-localisation of activations to study dynamic interactions of these basal ganglia structures with other elements of the putative control network, under conditions of cancellation and prevention. \n\nOur findings raise questions about the connectivity underlying these dynamic interactions. Of particular interest is the connectivity of these basal ganglia regions with other putative supramodal areas associated with inhibitory control (e.g., DLPFC, VLPFC), and also with domain-specific regions involved in memory and action, such as the hippocampus and the primary motor cortex (M1) respectively. For example, in our meta-analyses, by localising clusters within the basal ganglia, we observed that all of the Go\/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think\/No-Think tasks recovered clusters in the centromedial striatum, including the caudate head\/body, spanning across the internal capsule into medial putamen. This cluster roughly coincides with the region identified by   that receives projections from the DLPFC (areas 9\/46). Although much care is needed when comparing anatomical landmarks across species,   presented evidence based on diffusion imaging that the frontostriatal projections from anterior prefrontal cortex are more similar between humans and macaque monkeys than those from posterior frontal regions such as the frontal eye field (FEF) and M1. Since the DLPFC is thought to play important roles in stopping actions and thoughts ( ; Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2015;  ,  ), and since this general belief was strongly confirmed in our meta-analytic conjunction analysis for action cancellation and memory inhibition ( ), this putative DLPFC-striatal pathway could be a candidate through which memory and motor inhibition are achieved. This possibility must await further confirmation. \n\nDespite its similarity to action cancellation, the memory inhibition cluster extended to parts of the right putamen and GPe more than did motor stopping in general. It is unclear what functions these potentially memory-inhibition-specific activations of putamen and GPe may be performing, or whether these functions are unique to this process or simply a more robust and spatially extensive engagement of putamen processes observed during action cancellation. The possibility that parts of the putamen may serve functions specific to memory control should be considered. It is worth noting, for example, that although the putamen is often seen as a motor structure ( ), recent evidence suggests that it is involved in cognitive processes such as working memory ( ), episodic memory encoding ( ), and cognitive control ( ), and both neuroimaging and computational modelling suggest that the basal ganglia play critical roles in memory processes ( ,  ,  ). Indeed,   also found that the putamen is significantly activated in the interaction between memory, action, and reward. Specifically, participants learned four different categories of objects, each indicating whether the participants should respond to a following visual stimulus, and whether the correct action\/inaction would lead to a reward or avoid a loss. They found that activity in the right dorsal putamen significantly predicted memory retrieval when the associated action\/inaction led to the expected, but not to the unexpected level of reward. Although these related findings do not speak to a role of the putamen in memory inhibition, they do indicate that this structure interacts with the medial temporal lobes during memory tasks, providing precedent for such a role. The circuitry underlying this potential contribution to memory inhibition remains to be identified. \n\nOn top of the established network of motor control involving the basal ganglia, several authors have discussed potential interactions between the basal ganglia and the hippocampus. While some found that the basal ganglia and the hippocampus may be largely independent from each other ( ), others have suggested more complex relationships between the two systems during memory functions. On the one hand, basal ganglia and hippocampal processes may be competitive in nature, such that increased activation in one structure is associated with decreased activation in the other ( ,  ).   reviewed evidence for the competition between the hippocampal and basal ganglia systems in classification learning, and proposed that the competition may be modulated by task demands and behavioural success.   re-analysed a classification learning dataset wherein participants performed a weather prediction task. In this task, participants performed on-line learning where they associated visual stimuli with weather categories. Using structural equation modelling, they identified that the competitive interaction between the basal ganglia and the medial temporal lobe is mediated by the prefrontal cortex. This work provides evidence against direct interactions between the basal ganglia and the hippocampus, at least in the context of Rodriguez and Poldrack's classification task. \n\nDespite this evidence that the basal ganglia and the hippocampal systems are independent or interact through the prefrontal cortex, other evidence has suggested that the basal ganglia and hippocampus may interact in other ways. For example, Sabatino and colleagues found evidence that basal ganglia activity influences hippocampal oscillations. Specifically, whereas caudate stimulation appeared to influence the hippocampal theta rhythm by inhibiting the hippocampal spikes ( ,  ), pallidal stimulation triggered enhanced epileptiform activity, inducing generalised seizure activity ( ).   also found entrainment of ventral\/medial striatal neurons to the hippocampal theta in rats. Moreover, using Granger Causal Modelling on fMRI data,   found evidence for effective connectivity from the putamen to both the caudate and posterior hippocampus, as well as from posterior hippocampus to the caudate. These interactions were observed in two tasks. One was a weather prediction task, where participants learned on-line whether a visual stimulus was meant to predict rain or sunshine. The other was a subjective judgement task, wherein the participants rated whether their weather categorisation was based on memories or guesses. The foregoing findings raise the possibility that the basal ganglia may exert a controlling influence on target structures in both memory and motor inhibition. In the case of memory inhibition, this controlling influence may arise through complex polysynaptic interactions with the hippocampus. Further research is needed to elucidate how these interactions might be achieved. \n\nUltimately, determining the extent to which a supramodal cancellation process truly exists will depend on whether intrinsic basal ganglia pathways are engaged in similar ways for memory and motor inhibition tasks, including the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways. Unfortunately, meta-analytic activations do allow us to determine which specific pathways are required by these tasks. For example, increased striatal activity may imply engagement of either the direct or indirect pathway, or an interaction between the two. Similarly, increased STN activity may indicate engagement of either the hyperdirect or the indirect pathway. Despite these limits on our data, it is worth considering how a supramodal cancellation process might emerge from these pathways. In one recent effort ( ) analysed a range of computational models characterising the cognitive and motor functions of the basal ganglia with possible contributions from these interacting pathways. Specifically, global blocking of activations, such as premature-response prevention and working memory updating, may be modulated by the hyperdirect and the indirect pathways; response inhibition\/deferral and working memory gate closing may be modulated by the interaction between the direct and the short indirect pathways. Some of the proposals developed in this analysis might be extended to characterize how the basal ganglia are engaged to suppress retrieval from episodic memory, and the precise manner in which this process resembles action cancellation. \n\nAlthough we sought to localise basal ganglia clusters in memory and motor inhibition tasks, our approach is not without caveats. For example,   discussed a few limitations in Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE). Due to the coordinate-based nature of the ALE algorithm, the analysis only considers the peak coordinates reported in each study, but not the extent of each cluster of activation where the peaks lie. In addition, the peak coordinates may be influenced by the specific methods used in each study (e.g., thresholding, smoothing, registration and normalisation). Most of the studies included in the current study adopted standard preprocessing methods from widely used neuroimaging software (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI), including slice-time correction, motion correction, normalisation, and smoothing. There were, however, variations in approach. For example, the smoothing kernel ranged from 3\u00a0mm to 12\u00a0mm and a few studies also used customised methods (Supplement). Moreover, a number of studies conducted first-level analyses in native space (Supplement), and later normalised the contrast images to standard templates. These variations necessarily limit the spatial precision we can attribute to the current findings and should be considered in interpreting the data. \n\nFurthermore, the ALE activation maps, rightfully, model the spatial uncertainty of the reported peak coordinates from each study, which introduces a certain level of spatial smoothness. These factors also recommend caution when drawing conclusions about the precise localisation of our observed activations, given limitations on spatial resolution inherent to the meta-analytic method. Reporting bias is also a consideration, because some researchers may choose to omit activation peaks that do not fit prior expectations for a task, especially if the spatial extent of the activation is small, as would be true for some of the structures of key interest within the basal ganglia. These caveats have led some to argue that results from coordinate-based meta-analysis should be treated as an integration of existing knowledge instead of the absolute truth ( ), as more accurate and complete information would require an image-based meta-analysis or \u2018mega-analysis\u2019 ( ). \n\nOne final caveat, applicable to this and all other ALE meta-analyses, concerns how to interpret lack of significant clusters in a structure of interest. One hand, failing to find a significant cluster for a particular task may indicate that the structure is genuinely not engaged in the task. On the other hand, because the ALE algorithm seeks to identify clusters of activation, lack of a significant cluster may also be consistent with the presence of more dispersed activation peaks that fail to constitute a significant cluster. Indeed, the visualisation and counts of activation peaks in the left and right basal ganglia show clearly that there exist activations in basal ganglia structures in both hemispheres, especially for our two motor stopping tasks (see   and  ). Thus, whether one should interpret the differently lateralized clusters for action prevention and cancellation derived from ALE as indicating a meaningful task dissociation depends on the assumption that spatially clustered activations are more meaningful than those that are more dispersed. Regardless of the method of analysis, however, memory inhibition in the Think\/No-Think task appeared to yield more spatially concentrated activations predominantly lateralised to the right basal ganglia. Due to the moderate number of coordinates available in current studies, however, quantitative examination of task-related differences in the spatial distribution of coordinates across sub-regions of the basal ganglia must await future studies. \n\nDespite these limitations, our meta-analyses have provided the first meta-analytic evidence that memory and motor inhibition (action cancellation in particular) engage overlapping regions within the basal ganglia. These patterns suggest that similar frontostriatal pathways may be involved when people stop thoughts or actions. Moreover, by localising the observed clusters within our high-resolution manual segmentation of striatal subregions, we hope that our results can serve as a useful reference against which the results of future studies may be compared. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current meta-analyses demonstrate that the basal ganglia are consistently activated in the inhibition of both actions and thoughts. This basic finding is broadly congruent with recent literature indicating that the basal ganglia are not merely involved in motor control, but also in higher-level cognitive processes, such as memory. Importantly, however, the surprising similarity of memory inhibition to action cancellation more than action prevention suggests that the nature of the stopping processes that are recruited may dictate the localisation of basal ganglia activity more so than does task domain, at least for the tasks we studied. Our data indicate that, during cancellation, similar cortical and basal ganglia regions are engaged, irrespective of the domain of the process that is controlled, consistent with the possibility of a supramodal cancellation process. Meanwhile, the differences in activation clusters between the Go\/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks suggest that they may engage different stopping processes and that it may imprudent to treat these tasks equivalently. However, it bears emphasis that the current ALE meta-analysis is more sensitive to clustered activations than to dispersed ones. The inference that motor cancellation and motor prevention are distinctly localised in these data depends on the assumption that highly clustered activations (as detected by ALE) provide a more informative signature of functional specialization in the basal ganglia than more dispersed activations would, an assumption that deserves to be critically examined when more data is available. Importantly, future studies should characterise the specific basal ganglia engagement in memory and motor inhibition and investigate how the frontal, basal ganglia, and domain specific target regions (e.g., motor cortex and hippocampus) interact to perform specific stopping processes in different task domains. Extending the study of the role of the basal ganglia in inhibitory control to measure the stopping of both actions and thoughts will provide a valuable source of constraint on hypotheses about the computational functions that the basal ganglia perform. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5759998,"text_md5":"a264a1d6ad137b166a07e4709e236919","field_positions":{"authors":[0,101],"journal":[102,118],"publication_year":[120,124],"title":[135,228],"keywords":[242,941],"abstract":[954,3679],"body":[3688,86994]},"batch":2,"pmid":29199109,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2017.11.033","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5759998","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5759998"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5759998\">5759998<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5759998  A supramodal role of the basal ganglia in memory and motor inhibition: Meta-analytic evidence"}

However, findings on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie smoking-related and smoking-unrelated reward processing in smokers have been inconsistent. Neuroimaging experiments that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reported brain responses to smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers and healthy controls as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space were identified by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to December 2018. Three meta-analyses were performed using random-effect nonparametric statistics with Seed-based d Mapping software, with brain activity contrast from individual studies as the input. The striatum showed higher activation in response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues in 816 smokers from 28 studies and lower activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in 275 smokers compared with 271 healthy control individuals from 13 studies. The relative reactivity of the putamen to smoking-related cues increased in 108 smokers compared with 107 healthy controls from seven studies. Meta-regression showed that smokers with a greater severity of nicotine dependence exhibited less engagement of the striatum in response to both smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues. The present results reveal the disruption of reward system function in smokers and provide new insights into diverging theories of addiction. With the escalation of nicotine dependence, nicotine appears to exert dynamic effects on reward processing, based on incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing disorder and one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death. More than 16 million Americans live with smoking-related diseases, and >480,000 people die from smoking every year. Approximately 1 in 5 deaths are attributable to smoking . Given the current situation, yearly smoking-related deaths are expected to rise to 8 million by 2030 . Although most smokers report a desire to quit, the majority of attempts fail within 10 days . Numerous studies reported that craving that is induced by smoking-related cues is responsible for the failure to quit and high rates of relapse . One core characteristic of addiction is the disruption of reward processing , which influences decision-making and leads to smoking behavior . The relationship between alterations of reward processing and nicotine dependence has been well demonstrated, but no consensus has been reached on the neurobiological substrates that underling smoking-related and nonsmoking reward-related processing. \n\nAccording to incentive sensitization theory, repeated pairings between smoking-related cues (e.g., cigarette packs, lighters, and smoking-related pictures and videos) and smoking itself increase the dopaminergic response to these nonpharmacological cues, ultimately conferring heightened incentive properties to these stimuli . Neural systems that subserve reward-related learning, primarily represented in the striatum, are hijacked by reward cues and related contexts that predict the availability of smoking, resulting in higher responsivity to smoking-related cues and relatively lower responsivity to nonsmoking reward-related cues. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), based on the contrast of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, several studies investigated brain activation in response to smoking-related stimuli compared with neutral cues in smokers. Using a cue exposure task, Baker et al. found that smokers exhibited heightened reward responsiveness to cigarette rewards relative to monetary rewards . A cohort study that used an incentive-processing task found that individuals who smoked more cigarettes per day exhibited lower right nucleus accumbens reactivity to a nonsmoking reward . \n\nIn contrast to incentive sensitization theory, reward deficiency syndrome theory proposes that addicts exhibit general deficits in the recruitment of brain reward pathways, resulting in the chronic hypoactivation of these circuits in response to both drug- and nondrug-related reward . Several studies support this proposition. For example, dependent smokers exhibited equivalently low reward system activity in response to both reward types . An fMRI study revealed that smokers exhibited lower brain reactivity, especially in reward-related brain regions (e.g., caudate and putamen), to nontobacco reward-related stimuli (e.g., favorite food) compared with nonsmokers . Another study investigated the association between the severity of nicotine dependence and the response to monetary rewards and found that the intensity of nicotine craving among smokers was linked to lower sensitivity to nondrug-related rewards . The threshold of reward has been shown to increase as addiction develops, expressed by higher drug tolerance. \n\nThese divergent results may be attributable to different cue exposure paradigms and different fMRI parameters. Furthermore, small sample sizes hamper the ability to distinguish general activation patterns. A qualitative meta-analysis by Engelmann et al. (2012) reported activation of the precuneus, cingulate gyrus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum when smokers were presented with smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues . However, these authors only included smokers and did not make comparisons with healthy controls. A more complete analysis is needed to understand the neural processing of smoking-related cues in smokers and differences from healthy controls. The present study investigated specific smoking-related activation patterns compared with neutral cues in smokers and compared brain activity in response to smoking-related cues between smokers and healthy controls. We also compared brain activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers and healthy controls. We sought to provide an overall reward processing profile of neural substrates in smokers. \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nCandidate studies for the cue reactivity meta-analysis were identified by searching the PubMed (Medline), Embase, and Web of Science databases. The combination of search terms included (i) smok* (smoking, smoker, cigarette, tobacco, nicotine) AND (ii) fMRI (e.g., neuroimaging, brain imaging, BOLD, fMRI, MRI, brain reactivity, neutral reactivity) AND (cue reactivity [cue, smoking-related, smoking cues] OR reward [money, reward, monetary, gain]). The time span for the included studies was from 1 January 2000 to 31 November 2018. The reference lists of the publications and related reviews  were also examined to identify additional studies. A study was eligible if it (i) was a task-related fMRI study, (ii) compared smoking-related cues with neutral cues (all modalities pooled) or involved nonsmoking reward-related cues, (iii) provided peak coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space or Talairach space, and (iv) measured nicotine dependence severity using the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The studies that were included in the present meta-analysis did not necessarily include two groups (only smokers or smokers and healthy controls). The searches identified 33 articles that involved fMRI and smoking cues (two studies reported brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers and comparisons between smokers and healthy controls; 26 studies only reported brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers; five studies only reported comparisons between smokers and healthy controls), resulting in 28 publications that were included in the meta-analysis that examined brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers and seven studies that examined brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls. We also identified 13 publications for nonsmoking reward processing in smokers compared with healthy controls. The detailed process of identifying eligible studies and the reasons for exclusion are presented in Fig.  .   \nFlow chart of the identification of eligible studies. \n  \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nAll coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed using anisotropic effect-size Seed-based d Mapping (SDM, version 5.1.4,  , formerly \u201cSigned Differential Mapping\u201d) . A noteworthy feature of SDM is that it considers studies with positive, negative, and nonsignificant results simultaneously, leading to more precise estimates. It can also provide information about between-study heterogeneity. The software first recreates the study maps of the effect size of differences in BOLD responses between patients and control subjects by converting the   t   value of each peak to Hedges\u2019 effect size and then applies an anisotropic nonnormalized Gaussian kernel so that voxels that are more correlated with the peak have higher effect sizes. Maps are combined with a standard random-effects model, taking into account sample size, intrastudy variability, and between-study heterogeneity. In the SDM Z map, studies with lower variability and a larger sample size made a stronger contribution. Statistical inference was empirically estimated using permutation statistics (i.e., randomization of effect sizes across voxels). Previous studies recommended that 20 permutations lead to stable estimates. In the present study, all of the analyses that are reported were based on 50 permutations . The statistical heterogeneity of individual clusters was examined using a random-effects model. All thresholds were   p  \u2009<\u20090.005, uncorrected with peak height   z  \u2009\u2265\u20091 and cluster extent\u2009=\u200910 voxels. For each significant patient-control comparison, Egger\u2019s test was used to assess the asymmetry of the funnel plot as a measure of potential publication bias . Three different meta-analyses were conducted. First, smoking cue-induced brain activity was compared with the response to neutral cues in smokers. To better understand the influence of nicotine state (abstinent or satiated) on brain reactivity to smoking-related cues, two separate subgroup analyses for abstinent state and satiated state were conducted, and similarities or differences between states were explicitly tested. Second, brain activation in response to smoking-related cues in smokers was then compared with healthy controls. Third, brain activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers was compared with healthy controls. The relationship between the severity of nicotine dependence (FTND scores) and reactivity of reward-related brain regions to smoking-related and nonsmoking reward-related cues was examined using meta-regression. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature search and characteristics of the included studies \n  \nAs shown in Fig.  , a total of 46 papers were retrieved. Twenty-eight of these studies met the inclusion criteria, providing a sample size of 816 smokers (317 female) to investigate brain activity in response to smoking-related cues in smokers. Seven studies reported a comparison between smokers and healthy controls, providing a sample size of 108 smokers (32 female) and 107 healthy controls (37 female). The nonsmoking reward cue processing meta-analysis included 13 studies that evaluated the neural process of reward-related cue exposure, with a sample size of 275 smokers (114 female) and 271 healthy controls (102 female). The specific details of these studies, including demographic information, are shown in Supplementary Table  . \n\n\n### Main meta-analyses of cue-reactivity in smokers \n  \nOur first meta-analysis included the activation coordinates from all 28 studies. This analysis revealed five statistically significant clusters of smoking   minus   neutral activation in smokers (Table  , Fig.  ). The largest cluster was located within the left cingulate gyrus, including the anterior and posterior areas, and most of the significantly active voxels were located within the anterior cingulate gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters were the left angular gyrus and right thalamus. Smaller but theoretically important clusters of activation were detected in and around the right striatum. The increase in activation of the bilateral cingulate gyrus in response to smoking-related cues was consistently reported in smokers. To better address the influence of nicotine state (abstinent or satiated) on brain reactivity to smoking-related cues, a subgroup meta-analysis was also conducted. The two separate analyses of all abstinent-state and satiated-state studies also revealed a consistent increase in activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) and right striatum in response to smoking-related cues in smokers compared with neutral cues (for details, see Supplementary Table   and Table  ).   \nSuprathreshold clusters from activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. \n  \nCoordinates are given for the maximally significant voxel in each area, where   x   defines the lateral placement from the midline (left\u2009=\u2009negative),   y   defines the anteroposterior displacement relative to the anterior commissure (posterior\u2009=\u2009negative) and   z   defines the vertical position relative to the anteroposterior commissural line (down\u2009=\u2009negative). The coordinates are in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. \n     Brain regions showed significant differences in response to smoking-related cues or nonsmoking reward-related cues based on the meta-analyses.  \n a   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smoking-related cues and neutral cues in smokers.   b   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smokers and healthy controls in response to smoking-related cues.   c   Brain regions that showed significant differences between smokers and healthy controls in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. \n  \n\n\n### Main meta-analysis of comparison of smoking cue-induced brain reactivity between smokers and healthy controls \n  \nAfter combining the activation coordinates from seven studies, four statistically significant clusters of smokers   minus   healthy controls were found (Table  , Fig.  ). Many of these clusters that showed higher activity in smokers were located within the right middle frontal gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters included the orbital frontal gyrus and putamen. The lower activity in smokers (compared with healthy controls) when processing smoking-related cues was located within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n\n\n### Main meta-analysis of comparison of activity in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues between smokers and healthy controls \n  \nThe meta-analysis of nonsmoking reward-related activity included activation coordinates from all 13 studies. Four statistically significant clusters were found (Table  , Fig.  ), three of which showed higher activation in smokers compared with healthy controls and one of which showed lower activity. Most of the clusters that showed higher activation were located within the right inferior parietal gyrus and frontal gyrus. Other areas with a large concentration of clusters were located within the insula and inferior prefrontal cortex. Importantly, one large cluster that showed lower activation was located within reward circuitry, specifically the right striatum. \n\n\n### Meta-regression results \n  \nTo examine the effects of the severity of nicotine dependence on reward processing in smokers, meta-regression analyses were performed. The results revealed a significant relationship between FTND scores and activation of the striatum. This indicates that with greater dependence, activation of the striatum in response to reward cues decreased (i.e., both smoking-related cues (Fig.  , Supplementary Table  ) and nonsmoking reward-related cues (Fig.  , Supplementary Table  )). Interestingly, we found a significant positive correlation between the severity of nicotine dependence and reactivation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues, suggesting that greater involvement of the executive control brain regions in response to reward cues is associated with the greater severity of nicotine dependence.    Results of meta-regression in brain reactivity to smoking-related cues in smokers.  \n a   The cluster within the striatum that showed greater activation in response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues and the cluster within the striatum that showed differences in the meta-regression analysis with FTND score as a factor.   b   Forest plot of the mean \u00b1 variance of effect sizes for activation differences in the striatum, estimated from individual studies with smoking-related cue exposure. \n     Results of meta-regression in brain reactivity to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers.  \n a   The cluster within the striatum that showed greater activation in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls and the cluster within the striatum that showed differences in the meta-regression analysis with FTND score as a factor.   b   Forest plot of the mean \u00b1 variance of effect sizes for group differences in the striatum, estimated from individual studies with nonsmoking reward-related cue exposure. \n  \n\n\n### Sensitivity analyses and publication bias tests \n  \nJackknife sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In our analysis, alterations were replicable in all combinations of studies. Leave-one-out validation indicated that regardless of which study was left out, the meta-analysis consistently identified greater activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in smokers in response to smoking-related cues. All of the combinations consistently reported lower activation of the striatum in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers compared with healthy controls. The results of the Jackknife sensitivity analyses for the striatum are presented in the   (Supplementary Tables  \u2013 ). \n\nPublication bias is generally the tendency of researchers, journal editors, and corporate entities to manage the reporting of experimental findings that are \u201csignificant\u201d differently from findings that are \u201cnonsignificant.\u201d This then leads to bias in the overall published literature toward only \u201cstatistically significant\u201d effects. Publication bias in the present meta-analyses was tested using Egger\u2019s regression approach. For visual inspection, funnel plots were also generated (Supplementary Figure  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe conducted three meta-analyses of fMRI studies of smoking-related cue exposure and nonsmoking reward-related cue exposure in smokers. Activation of the striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus increased in response to smoking-related cues vs. neutral cues in smokers. The putamen showed greater activation in smokers vs. healthy controls when processing smoking-related cues. The striatum showed lower activation in smokers vs. healthy controls in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. The meta-regression analysis showed that sensitivity of the reward system was disrupted as the severity of nicotine dependence increased, with lower activation of the striatum in response to smoking-related cues and nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers with higher FTND scores. \n\nIn response to smoking-related cues compared with neutral cues in smokers, the cingulate gyrus was the most consistently activated. The cingulate gyrus is a critical region of the limbic system. Previous studies have shown that the anterior cingulate gyrus receives projections from structures that process rewards, including the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and mesolimbic dopamine system . Lesions of the anterior cingulate gyrus impaired reward learning and behavioral adjustments that were related to changes in reward . The present study found a robust positive correlation between reactivation of the anterior cingulate gyrus in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues and the severity of nicotine dependence. The posterior cingulate gyrus is a critical center of the default mode and attentional networks . Neuroimaging studies have shown that it is activated during visual tasks when a monetary incentive is involved, essentially functioning as a neural interface between motivation-related areas and the top-down control of visual attention . Increases in activation of the prefrontal cortex are related to executive control, suggesting that smokers need to exert extra control of smoking urges when exposed to smoking-related cues. The increase in activation of the cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex in response to smoking-related cues in smokers suggests an increase in the distribution of attention to smoking-related cues in smokers. This is consistent with previous studies that found greater attentional bias toward drug-related cues in smokers. For example, smokers maintained their gaze on smoking-related cues for a longer period of time compared with control cues . This result might also be partially explained by incentive sensitization theory, which proposes that repeated associations between drug-related cues and addictive drugs increase the dopaminergic response to these essentially neutral cues, ultimately causing pathological incentive motivation (\u201cwanting\u201d) for these stimuli . \n\nCompared with healthy controls, the activation of reward circuitry significantly increased in response to smoking-related cues and significantly decreased in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues in smokers, thus supporting incentive sensitization theory. After repeated associations with smoking, the nonpharmacological neutral stimulus acquires the properties of an incentive reward. Greater activation in the caudate nucleus and cingulate gyrus is consistently found, with the notion that the presence of smoking-related cues increases nicotine\/tobacco seeking and hence relapse rates . The striatum and medial prefrontal cortex have been shown to be activated by smoking-related cues, demonstrating the ability of smoking-related stimuli to engage reward-related circuitry. Our meta-analysis showed relatively consistent activation of the prefrontal cortex and striatum, further supporting incentive sensitization theory. \n\nFor nonsmoking reward processing, the significant decrease in activation of the caudate in smokers compared with healthy controls is consistent with reward deficiency syndrome theory. This theory of motivation proposes that addicts have a general deficit in the recruitment of brain reward pathways, resulting in chronic hypoactivation of these circuits in response to both drug- and nondrug-related reward . Previous studies have consistently reported greater activation of the striatum in response to monetary rewards. The striatum has been shown to be involved in reward prediction and the subjective value of rewards . In substance-dependent individuals, the incentive value of nondrug reward is lost, leading to lower activation in the striatum during the processing of monetary and other natural rewards. The decrease in activation of the striatum in response to nondrug rewards has also been observed in opioid addicts , cocaine addicts , and alcohol abusers . However, the finding of lower activation of the striatum in response to nondrug rewards contradicts the recent meta-analysis by Luijten et al. . This discrepancy might be associated with three important differences between these two studies. First, the present study focused on nonsmoking reward-related cues regardless of the type of cue. We pooled monetary and juice cues, whereas the study by Luijten focused only on monetary cues. Second, the present study focused on reward-related cues and reward outcome phases and did not include an anticipatory phase; therefore, the nonsmoking reward-related cues represented the presence of reward outcomes. Third, the present study focused only on nicotine addiction and did not include other addictions. A previous study performed a direct comparison between food cues and smoking cues and found greater activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus in response to smoking cues compared with food cues . The greater engagement of attentional networks and reward-related brain regions during exposure to smoking-related cues is consistent with the present results. \n\nInterestingly, the meta-regression revealed lower activation of the striatum in response to both types of rewards in smokers who had higher FTND scores. This seems to contradict incentive sensitization theory, thus supporting reward deficiency syndrome theory instead. Combining the main results of the meta-analyses and meta-regression, incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory do not appear to conflict with each other when considering the severity of dependence. Nicotine first appears to hijack the reward system and gain incentive value, which is consistent with incentive sensitization theory. As the severity of nicotine dependence increases, sensitivity of the reward system is disrupted, which could be explained by reward deficiency syndrome theory. These two theories could be combined to interpret dissociable activation of the striatum that is observed in smokers. The disruption of reward reactivity to reward-related cues coincides with the development of drug tolerance, meaning that the same dose of nicotine fails to induce the same activation as nicotine dependence develops. Further studies are needed to verify dynamic alterations of the reward system that occur in other kinds of drug dependence and investigate the relationship between reward processing deficits and the severity of drug dependence. \n\nThe present study has several limitations that are inherent to all meta-analyses. First, meta-analyses that are based on peak and effect sizes use data from published studies rather than raw statistical brain maps, thus decreasing accuracy of the results. Second, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution when considering inter-study heterogeneity. Different studies adopted different statistical thresholds and multiple-comparison corrections. \n\nIn conclusion, the reward system appears to be hijacked by the initiation of nicotine dependence, expressed as greater activation of the reward system in response to smoking-related cues and lower activation of the reward system in response to nonsmoking reward-related cues. However, activation in response to both types of cues decreased as the severity of nicotine dependence increased, indicating general disruption of sensitivity of the reward system. The present study further reveals the dynamic nature of reward system alterations in smokers and provides new insights into disentangling the divergence between incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory to explain addiction. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7078287,"text_md5":"9e5ef2c9dc585d6b7e4c7eec5cb34151","field_positions":{"authors":[0,212],"journal":[213,230],"publication_year":[232,236],"title":[247,345],"keywords":[359,394],"abstract":[407,2121],"body":[2130,27478]},"batch":2,"pmid":32184386,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-020-0775-0","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7078287","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7078287"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7078287\">7078287<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7078287  Neural substrates of smoking and reward cue reactivity in smokers: a meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}
{"text":"Berluti, Kathryn and Ploe, Montana L. and Marsh, Abigail A.\nTransl Psychiatry, 2023\n\n# Title\n\nEmotion processing in youths with conduct problems: an fMRI meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nDiagnostic markers\nNeuroscience\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently indicate differences in emotion processing in youth with conduct problems. However, no prior meta-analysis has investigated emotion-specific responses associated with conduct problems. This meta-analysis aimed to generate an up-to-date assessment of socio-affective neural responding among youths with conduct problems. A systematic literature search was conducted in youths (ages 10\u201321) with conduct problems. Task-specific seed-based d mapping analyses examined responses to threatening images, fearful and angry facial expressions, and empathic pain stimuli from 23 fMRI studies, which included 606 youths with conduct problems and 459 comparison youths. Whole-brain analyses revealed youths with conduct problems relative to typically developing youths, when viewing angry facial expressions, had reduced activity in left supplementary motor area and superior frontal gyrus. Additional region of interest analyses of responses to negative images and fearful facial expressions showed reduced activation in right amygdala across youths with conduct problems. Youths with callous-unemotional traits also exhibited reduced activation in left fusiform gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus when viewing fearful facial expressions. Consistent with the behavioral profile of conduct problems, these findings suggest the most consistent dysfunction is found in regions associated with empathic responding and social learning, including the amygdala and temporal cortex. Youth with callous-unemotional traits also show reduced activation in the fusiform gyrus, consistent with reduced attention or facial processing. These findings highlight the potential role of empathic responding, social learning, and facial processing along with the associated brain regions as potential targets for interventions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConduct problems, including aggression, non-violent delinquency, and other antisocial behaviors all increase rapidly during late childhood, spiking in adolescence and young adulthood [ ]. However, youths who display particular patterns of activation when processing socio-affective information have a greater likelihood of exhibiting conduct problems across development [ \u2013 ]. Identifying neurodevelopmental features of the highest-risk youths is essential for developing targeted screening and intervention tools. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of youth with conduct problems to investigate patterns of emotion-specific neural responding [ \u2013 ]. \n\nMany youths with conduct problems receive diagnoses of conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) [ ]; either of these diagnoses before the age of 15, relative to all other childhood diagnoses, place youth at the highest risk of adult clinical diagnoses such as substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder [ ]. Other high-risk youths receive diagnoses of a disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified (DBD NOS) or exhibit subthreshold conduct problems that nonetheless are associated with increased delinquency, substance use, and aggression [ ]. A subset of youths with behavior problems and callous-unemotional traits or limited prosocial emotions (LPE), characterized by reduced guilt and empathy, and a bold, fearless temperament, exhibit more homogenous patterns of neural risk factors [ ]. These traits are highly correlated with externalizing behaviors such as aggression, bullying, and delinquency and have poorer treatment outcomes [ ,  ]. \n\nNeuroimaging research has identified aberrant brain responses in youth with conduct problems with and without callous-unemotional traits during threat responding, emotion processing, and empathic responding [ \u2013 ]. Prior meta-analyses in youth with conduct problems have grouped these processes into a general emotion processing category that includes all affective tasks [ ,  ] or a \u201chot executive functioning\u201d category that additionally includes cognitive tasks with affective components [ ]. These meta-analyses have identified a range of differences with multiple meta-analyses identifying differences in the amygdala [ ,  ], basal ganglia [ ,  ,  ], and thalamus [ ,  ]. Notably, however, no prior meta-analysis has investigated emotion-specific patterns of neural responding in youth with conduct problems, despite evidence that distinct affective domains like fear, anger, and pain recruit distinct networks of brain regions implicated in conduct problems [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nPrior meta-analyses have also investigated the specific impact of callous-unemotional traits on affective responding, with one meta-analysis reporting differences in the hypothalamus, thalamus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex among youths with these traits [ ]. Notably, these findings were found in youth with psychopathic traits generally, not callous-unemotional traits specifically, and across several emotion processing domains, rather than a specific type of emotion processing. A second meta-analysis conducting a region of interest (ROI) analysis found callous-unemotional traits were associated with reduced amygdala responding in both general affective and threat domains [ ]. Our meta-analyses aimed to extend these findings by considering how conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits correspond to neural responses to affective and aversive imagery in general, as well as to four specific domains of socio-affective cues: negative images, fearful expressions, angry expressions, and empathic pain imagery [ ]. Atypical responses to each of these socio-affective cues has been previously linked to the development of conduct problems. \n\nWe thus focused on studies that assessed responses to affective stimuli, including aversive images, fearful or angry facial expressions, and empathic pain images in youths with conduct problems ages 10\u201321. For each analysis, we compared all youths with conduct problems to controls, with additional analyses focusing on youths with callous-unemotional traits. We conducted both whole-brain analyses and ROI analyses of the left and right amygdala, the only ROI consistently reported across publications. We also conducted a follow-up meta-regression that included callous-unemotional traits to predict amygdala activity to fearful expressions. All hypotheses, included contrasts, sampling criteria, and analysis techniques were pre-registered at  . \n\nHypotheses included that youth with conduct problems would show (1) Reduced responding in prefrontal and limbic regions such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala across task categories, (2) Reduced activity in the amygdala while viewing threatening\/negative stimuli, (3) Reduced activity to empathic pain imagery within the pain matrix, such as the ACC anterior insula (AI), in youths with conduct problems, (4) Reduced activity in amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex when viewing fearful expressions, with (4a) More severe reductions observed in the amygdala in youths with callous-unemotional traits. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search procedure \n  \nBest-practices to identify fMRI studies for inclusion were followed [ ]. A systematic literature search was conducted of whole-brain fMRI studies in youths (ages 0\u201321) with conduct problems with or without callous-unemotional traits published prior to February 2021. Original registration planned age cutoff at 18, we then increased the cutoff to 21 to capture a more complete sample of publications. The search was executed using PubMed, with search terms similar to those used in prior meta-analyses: \u201cconduct disorder\u201d, \u201coppositional defiant disorder\u201d, \u201ccallous-unemotional\u201d, \u201climited prosocial emotions\u201d, \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d, \u201cantisocial behavior\u201d, \u201cpsychopathy\u201d, and \u201cpsychopathic traits\u201d, plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d, and \u201cfMRI\u201d [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. The references of included articles were again examined for inclusion. This approach allowed for a thorough search of all current literature [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nArticles were included if they (1) reported   x  \/  y  \/  z   coordinates using Talairach and Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) templates [ ,  ], (2) reported results based on whole-brain analyses, (3) included   z  -statistics,   t  -statistics, or uncorrected   p  -values, (4) reported statistics of peak activation in Talairach41 or MNI template space, (5) included more than 10 participants, (6) included participants ages 21 or younger, (6) were published in English, and (7) were published prior to February, 2021. Additionally, only studies with relevant contrasts were included (aversive\/threating stimuli\u2009>\u2009neutral stimuli; fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral\/happy\/scrambled expressions, anger\u2009>\u2009neutral\/happy\/scrambled expressions, and self-pain\u2009>\u2009other-pain). Reward and punishment tasks were not included due to poor overlap across studies in available contrasts; additionally, too few studies included prediction error during reward processing for inclusion. Similar to other meta-analyses [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ], we included only case\u2013control studies in which healthy youth were compared to youth either diagnosed with a disruptive behavior disorder or described as having elevated conduct problems as assessed using a research instrument like the Child Behavior Checklist. This enabled planned analyses to test group differences. Studies were included in the callous-unemotional traits meta-regression analysis if they reported scores on a measure of callous-unemotional traits, including the Youth Personality Inventory Callous-Unemotional scale (YPI-CU) [ ], the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) [ ], or the Antisocial Process Screening Device Callous-Unemotional scale (ASPD-CU) [ ]. \n\nPrisma workflow guidelines were followed for article selection (Fig.\u00a0 ). Articles were reviewed by two researchers (K.B., M.P.) for eligibility, and after the initial screening process 12 studies were excluded for the following reasons: 2 did not report any whole-brain contrasts [ ,  ], 1 reported findings already reported in a separate included study [ ], and 9 did not include both healthy controls and youths with conduct problems, precluding group comparisons [ \u2013 ].    PRISMA 2020 flow diagram.  \nAfter studies were identified from a database and citation search, duplicate records were removed. Full text records were screened and studies were excluded (837 studies) that summarized the literature and did not report new findings, we not within the age range, did not use task based fMRI to measure emotion processing, did not investigate conduct problems, or were case studies. Additional screening excluded studies that did not report whole brain results (2 studies), reported duplicate findings from an already included study (1 study), did not have a healthy or conduct problems comparison group (9 studies). \n  \n\n\n### Meta-analysis pre-processing \n  \nWe used seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI version 6.21) to estimate effect-size maps, with lower and upper bounds, for all relevant contrasts collected based on peak coordinates and reported or calculated   t  -values [ ]. We selected this method because it accounts for effect-sizes, null results, and includes sign information to counteract positive and negative differences between peaks. Family-wise error calculations also provide stricter significance testing. These stricter thresholds favor avoiding Type 1 errors and thus yield more accurate effect-size maps, but may result in more null findings than methods used in some previous meta-analyses. All whole-brain maps were calculated using gray matter masks. ROI analyses used the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas with 2\u2009mm [ ] voxels. Voxel estimates were then imputed multiple times to reduce bias [ ]. These images were combined into a single image for each study to be entered into the meta-analysis. Finally, corresponding voxels across all study images were combined into the final meta-analysis effect-size map. Results are reported separately that were statistically significant following FWER-correction threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (1000 permutations) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) and that were statistically significant at an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 [ ]. \n\nTo check for potential sampling error, we collected between-study heterogeneity statistics (  I  ), with a score of 25% or less reported as low. Funnel plots were also generated to visualize relative contributions of studies to meta-analytic findings, and publication bias statistics are reported for each significant peak. \n\nThe same method was used for all analyses to generate relevant contrasts. In the case of the main analysis, if multiple contrasts were available, as was the case for studies in which youths with both high and low callous-unemotional traits were included, or studies in which responses to both angry and fearful expressions were included, the contrast was selected that represented the largest sample and fearful contrasts were selected. Finally, we used an ROI approach to assess activation in the left and right amygdala. Other ROIs could not be assessed due to insufficient studies reporting common ROIs. Left and right amygdala ROIs were investigated separately using the AAL atlas [ ]. \n\nTo better assess the potential impact of callous-unemotional traits on amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions we conducted a meta-regression analysis. Due to inconsistencies in the measures used to assess callous-unemotional traits we calculated the percent of maximum possible (POMP) value for each study [ ] a technique used in prior meta-analyses [ ,  ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of included studies \n  \nIn total, 31 contrasts from 23 fMRI studies were included, which comprised 606 youths with disruptive behavior disorder diagnoses or described as having conduct problems (mean age\u2009=\u200914.59, mean age range\u2009=\u200911.9\u201317.45; mean% male\u2009=\u200973.24, mean IQ\u2009=\u200999.21) and 459 comparison youths (mean age\u2009=\u200914.59; mean age range\u2009=\u200911.30\u201317.80, mean% male\u2009=\u200969.41, mean IQ\u2009=\u2009102.69) [ \u2013 ,  \u2013 ]. Studies varied in the measures used to assess clinically relevant levels of conduct problems. Assessment information is reported in Table\u00a0 . Five studies including a total of 92 youth also reported separate contrasts specifically investigating responses to fearful facial expressions in youth with callous-unemotional traits relative to healthy controls (mean age\u2009=\u200914.02, mean age range\u2009=\u200911.9\u201315.5, mean% male\u2009=\u200984.72, mean IQ\u2009=\u200998.53).   \nSummary of whole-brain fMRI studies of youths with conduct problems relative to healthy control youths included in functional meta-analyses by task domain. \n  \n CU   Callous-unemotional,   CS   conditioned stimulus,   YPI   Youth Personality inventory,   ICU   Inventory of Callous-unemotional Traits, ASPD antisocial process screening device,   PCL-YV   Psychopathy Checklist Youth Version,   DISC-IV   Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version Four,   DSM-5   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition;   CBCL   Child Behavior Checklist, K-SADS Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia,   SDQ   Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire;   CASI-CD   Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory Conduct Disorder Scale, DISC-CD Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Conduct Disorder. \n\nOnly right amygdala values reported. \n\nValues not reported. \n\nScore reported was calculated using an unknown transformation. \n  \n\n\n### Group differences across all studies \n  \nThe whole-brain meta-analysis included 26 contrasts, one selected from each included study, and spanned all task types. No regions survived whole-brain FWER-correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) and only a significant uncorrected finding in the left cerebellum was observed (Table\u00a0 ).   \nResults of whole-brain and ROI fMRI meta-analyses of youths with conduct problems relative to healthy control youths by task domain and presence of callous-unemotional traits. \n  \n\nOur ROI analysis included 25 contrasts (one study did not report left amygdala results) with 5 studies reporting responses to fearful facial expressions and 8 reporting responses to negative images (Table\u00a0 ). Results showed reduced activation in right amygdala in youths with conduct problems relative to controls (Table\u00a0 ). No results were observed in left amygdala. Follow-up meta-regression analysis including POMP callous-unemotional scores from each study revealed, among youths with conduct problems, no relationship between right amygdala activation across tasks and callous-unemotional traits. \n\n\n### Group differences for negative images \n  \nThe whole-brain meta-analysis of studies reporting responses to negative affective images included 10 contrasts, one selected from each included study (Table\u00a0 ). No findings that survived FWER-correction or significant uncorrected findings at   p  \u2009=\u20090.005 were observed. \n\nThe ROI analysis included 16 contrasts, with 2 (left and right amygdala) selected from each included study (Table\u00a0 ). Again, results showed reduced activation in right amygdala in youths with conduct problems relative to controls (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ). No results were observed in left amygdala. Follow-up meta-regression analysis including POMP callous-unemotional scores from each study revealed that among youths with conduct problems, no relationship was observed between right amygdala activation to negative images and callous-unemotional traits.    Regions reduced in youths with conduct problems relative to healthy control youths in whole-brain and ROI fMRI meta-analyses by task domain.  \n A   Whole-brain results on angry facial expressions.   B   Whole-brain findings on empathic pain responses.   C   Results from the amygdala region of interest analysis on fearful facial expressions.   D   Results from the amygdala region of interest analysis on negative images. The right side of the image corresponds to the left side of the brain. \n  \n\n\n### Group differences for fearful facial expressions \n  \nThe whole-brain meta-analysis of studies reporting responses to fearful facial expressions included 8 contrasts, one selected from each included study and revealed no findings that survived FWER-correction or significant uncorrected findings at   p  \u2009=\u20090.005. \n\nThe ROI analysis included 9 contrasts with one study not reporting left amygdala findings (Table\u00a0 ). Again, results showed reduced activation in right amygdala in youths with conduct problems (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ) and no results were observed in left amygdala. Follow-up meta-regression analysis including POMP callous-unemotional scores from each study revealed no relationship between right amygdala activation when viewing fearful expressions and callous-unemotional traits among youth with conduct problems. \n\nA second whole-brain meta-analysis was also conducted examining only responses among youths with conduct problems and high levels of callous-unemotional traits to fearful facial expressions, which included 8 contrasts, one selected from each included study (Table\u00a0 ). No results survived FWER-correction. Regions in which youths with conduct problems showed less activation at an uncorrected threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.005) included a cluster spanning left superior and inferior parietal gyri, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Group differences for angry facial expressions \n  \nThe whole-brain meta-analysis of responses to angry facial expressions images included five contrasts, one selected from each included study. No results survived FWER-correction. Uncorrected group differences in activation were observed in a cluster spanning left supplementary motor area and superior frontal gyrus (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ). ROI analyses were not conducted due to a lack of sufficient available studies (  n  \u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n### Group differences for empathic pain images \n  \nThe whole-brain meta-analysis of responses to empathic pain images included 3 contrasts (Table\u00a0 ). Three regions survived FWER-correction, including a region that spanned right temporal pole and included areas of middle and inferior temporal gyrus in which youths with conduct problems showed reduced activation (Fig.\u00a0 ). Regions in which uncorrected group differences emerged included one region, left hippocampus, in which youths with conduct problems showed increased activation relative to controls, and several regions in which youths with conduct problems exhibited reduced activation, including two regions of the pain matrix: left SMA and thalamus and several regions of frontal and temporal cortex (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ). ROI analyses were not conducted due to too few available studies (  n  \u2009=\u20090). \n\n\n### Reliability analyses \n  \nAnalysis of between-study heterogeneity across all studies revealed whole-brain analysis peaks and ROI peaks showed low between-study heterogeneity (whole-brain:   I  \u2009=\u20090.2\u201314.8%; ROI:   I  \u2009=\u20090.83%) confirming results were not likely driven by sampling error. Additionally, we found low likelihood of sampling error in each socio-affective specific meta-analysis including negative images (  I  \u2009=\u20091.3%), fearful facial expressions (ROI:   I  \u2009=\u20093.8%; callous-unemotional traits:   I  \u2009=\u20091.9%\u20133.8%), angry facial expressions (  I  \u2009=\u20094.2\u20131.8%), and empathic pain images (  I  \u2009=\u20090\u20134.5%). \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nThere was no significant evidence of publication bias across all studies (whole-brain:   p  \u2009=\u20090.712\u20130.816; ROI:   p  \u2009=\u20090.723) or within socio-affective categories (negative:   p  \u2009=\u20090.971; fearful facial expressions ROI:   p  \u2009=\u20090.538, fearful facial expressions callous-unemotional traits:   p  \u2009=\u20090.793\u20130.985; angry facial expressions:   p  \u2009=\u20090.888\u20130.946). An insufficient number of studies existed to test for bias in the empathic pain meta-analysis. An investigation of the funnel plots across all meta-analyses did not suggest any one study contributed more heavily to significant peaks. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis included both whole-brain and amygdala ROI results from over 1000 youth (23 studies) and, to our knowledge, is the first meta-analysis to investigate emotion-specific differences in youths with conduct problems. Results consistently indicated that youths with conduct problems show reduced responding in right amygdala when viewing a range of negative affective images, including threatening images and fearful facial expressions. Results also make clear that responses to negative affective images are not interchangeable, with distinct patterns of atypical activation observed in response to the various sub-categories of images. When viewing angry expressions, youths with conduct problems exhibited reduced activation in left SMA; by contrast, when they observed fearful expressions, no differences were seen in this region. We also observed reduced activation in the left superior parietal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus in high callous-unemotional youths specifically when they viewed fearful faces. Finally, we found reduced activation in a subset of regions within the canonical pain matrix, including the thalamus and SMA (although notably not the anterior insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as we had hypothesized), as well as temporal pole when youth with conduct problems viewed images of others in pain. \n\nIn general, our most consistent finding was that youths with conduct problems exhibited reduced activation in right amygdala, specifically in response to negative images and fearful facial expressions. This finding is consistent with theories regarding etiologies of conduct problems [ ] and replicates several other meta-analytic findings in both youth [ ,  ,  ] and adults [ ,  ]. Reduced amygdala response to negative images may underpin youth with conduct problems\u2019 difficulty responding to fear-relevant stimuli, including difficulties coordinating physiological and cognitive responses to threats, and difficulties in interpreting social fear cues [ ,  \u2013 ]. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that reduced responding in the amygdala to a range of fear-relevant cues may underlie insensitivity to threat in children with conduct problems, which increases their likelihood of engaging in physically or socially risky behaviors that may result in punishment [ ]. Reduced amygdala responsiveness to fearful expressions may also impair the ability of youths with conduct problems to empathize with and correctly interpret others\u2019 fear [ ,  ,  ], and to avoid behaviors likely to cause fear in others [ ]. According to simulation theories of empathy, observers recruit the same networks when observing others\u2019 emotions that they recruit when personally experiencing those emotions [ ]. Thus, just as the amygdala plays a pivotal role in coordinating personally experienced fear [ ], it may play a similarly pivotal role in empathizing with others\u2019 fear. \n\nIt is noteworthy that, inconsistent with our hypothesis and prior meta-analytic findings [ ], reduced amygdala responding was found across youths with conduct problems, rather than being limited to youths with higher callous-unemotional traits. This finding could indicate that youths with conduct problems, even those without high callous-unemotional traits, generally show reduced amygdala responsiveness relative to healthy controls [ ]. This may in part reflect the fact that callous-unemotional traits and externalizing behavior are highly correlated [ ,  ]. In addition, several included studies compared control youths only to youths with conduct problems and callous-unemotional or psychopathic traits [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In these studies, even youths with   lower   levels of callous-unemotional traits nonetheless had relatively high baseline callous-unemotional traits. Thus, it is possible that included studies were not sufficiently powered, due either to sample size or range restriction, to identify patterns of neural variation that correspond to variation in callous-unemotional traits among children with conduct problems. Relatedly, our meta-regression found no relationship between callous-unemotional traits and fearful facial expressions. However, POMP scores ranged from .68-.74, meaning no study reported findings where youth averaged callous-unemotional traits scores in the top 25 percent of their respective scale. To better assess the true impact of callous-unemotional traits on fear processing, future research should be clear about the threshold that qualifies youth for \u201chigh\u201d levels of callous-unemotional traits. \n\nWe were able to conduct a separate whole-brain analysis for youth with high levels of callous-unemotional traits that revealed additional differences when these youths view fearful facial expressions, including reduced activity in left superior parietal gyrus, left fusiform, and left middle temporal gyrus. In contrast to prior meta-analytic results, we did not find differences in the middle frontal gyrus [ ]. These differences could be due to the specificity of our analysis which only included youth with callous-unemotional traits and not psychopathic traits more broadly; additionally, we tested differences in responding to fearful expressions rather than across all emotion processing tasks. Consistent with previous meta-analyses, we found differences in left fusiform activation that have also been reported in other meta-analysis that include individuals with conduct problems [ ] and a population expanded into adulthood [ ]. Although right fusiform is often recruited during face processing, a meta-analysis of facial affect responding also found left fusiform activation when healthy adults respond to negative faces [ ]. Our findings of reduced activation in this region in youths with high levels of callous-unemotional traits may indicate differences in attention or face processing coupled with amygdala hypoactivation [ ,  ,  ]. Again, callous-unemotional scores were limited to a relatively small range (0.68\u20130.74) and therefore, future research should investigate these regions in groups of youth scoring in the top 25 percent of callous-unemotional trait severity. \n\nDistinct patterns were observed across samples in response to angry stimuli, confirming that it may not be appropriate to collapse these expressions together into a common \u201cthreat expression\u201d category [ ]. In responses to angry expressions, youth with conduct problems exhibited reduced activity in middle temporal gyrus and SMA. Although we did not have specific hypotheses regarding responses to angry facial expressions, differences in SMA activation to threating stimuli have also been reported in a previous meta-analysis that included both youth and adults with conduct and antisocial behavior problems [ ]. This may may be in part because SMA is adjacent to and is often co-activated with, anterior mid-cingulate cortex, as it is in the current meta-analysis: The SMA cluster we identified extends into the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. These regions activated in conjunction with one another are important for regulating approach and avoidance behaviors, as well as error detection and response selection [ ,  ]. Angry expressions are believed to function in social interactions to signal social dominance and motivate others to change their behavior [ ,  ]. Reduced responding in this region in youth with conduct problems to others\u2019 anger may be underlie their reduced tendency to adjust their behavior in response to these social signals, an interpretation consistent with increased social dominance and aggression seen in youth with conduct problems [ ,  ]. \n\nConsistent with our hypotheses, we found youths with conduct problems exhibit reduced activity to empathic pain imagery in two canonical pain regions: SMA and thalamus. SMA and thalamus are regions consistently recruited during acute pain [ ,  ], as well as when observing others in pain [ ,  ]. These regions have also been found in other meta-analyses investigating antisocial behavior and conduct problems [ ,  ,  ]. Our results are therefore generally consistent with impairments in empathic pain responding in youths with conduct problems, which may contribute to their increased aggression. However, given the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis, these results should be interpreted with caution. Neurodevelopmental changes in this circuit may contribute to aggression and social learning impairments in youth with conduct problems [ ], a possibility that should be considered in future research on this topic. \n\nInterestingly, the empathic pain meta-analysis produced the most overlap in brain regions when compared to other emotion-general meta-analyses. Other studies report overlapping findings in the superior [ ] and inferior frontal gyrus [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ], temporal pole [ ], thalamus [ ], and precuneus [ ]. The large amount of overlap between prior emotion-general meta-analyses and empathic pain highlights the conducting meta-analyses with emotion-specific sub-analyses. The greater consistency in the methods of included studies may explain why the most robust findings were also observed when examining group differences during empathic pain tasks while other findings did not survive FWER-correction. Prior studies utilizing the same analysis technique as was used here (SDM) either do not report FWER-corrected results [ ] or also report few regions surviving error correction [ ]. It is possible this technique, SDM-PSI, is more sensitive to null findings and effect-sizes reported in individual studies, which may highlight the need for larger neuroimaging studies in the future with greater sensitivity. Also highlighting the need for larger studies, group differences in several hypothesized regions, including the insula and prefrontal cortex, were not found in the meta-analysis, despite frequent reports of functional differences in these regions between youth with and without conduct problems [ ]. Larger fMRI studies with more power will allow future emotion-specific meta-analyses to more precisely assess the robustness of these meta-analytic findings and may identify other functional differences in, for example, core regions of the pain matrix like anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. \n\nThese findings should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. First, the sample was drawn from a heterogenous set of research studies in terms of sampling and empirical design. Other variables that may distinguish subgroups of youths with conduct problems such as symptom onset, or exposure to trauma\u2014were rarely distinguished, preventing consideration of the potential role of these variables [ \u2013 ]. We were also unable to consider the role of disorders that often co-occur with conduct problems (including ADHD, anxiety, and depression). Finally, we were not able to control for variations among the tasks we included, such as whether they featured implicit versus explicit processing or passive viewing of stimuli; these specific task features may alter recruitment of amygdala and other regions [ ]. \n\nOur findings highlight differences in processing socio-affective cues including fearful and angry expressions and empathic pain that may underpin a lack of empathic responding, poor regulation of approach and avoidance, and heightened risk for aggression [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Future research should employ larger sample sizes for greater power and recruit youth with more variable levels of callous-unemotional traits to investigate the amygdala, SMA and mid-cingulate, as well as the left fusiform as potential targets for interventions aimed at reducing aggression and antisocial behavior. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10063659,"text_md5":"39afc9f514302c799487fe1b02507b10","field_positions":{"authors":[0,59],"journal":[60,77],"publication_year":[79,83],"title":[94,167],"keywords":[181,213],"abstract":[226,2116],"body":[2125,34051]},"batch":2,"pmid":36997510,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-023-02363-z","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10063659","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10063659"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10063659\">10063659<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10063659  Emotion processing in youths with conduct problems: an fMRI meta-analysis"}
{"text":"Seghezzi, Silvia and Zirone, Eleonora and Paulesu, Eraldo and Zapparoli, Laura\nFront Psychol, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nThe Brain in (Willed) Action: A Meta-Analytical Comparison of Imaging Studies on Motor Intentionality and Sense of Agency\n\n# Keywords\n\nsense of agency\nmotor intention\naction awareness\nfMRI\nPET\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nVoluntary actions can be fractionated in different phenomena: from the emergence of intentions and the ensuing motor plans and actions, to the anticipation and monitoring of their outcomes, to the appreciation of their congruency with intentions and to the eventual emergence of a sense of agency. It follows that motor intention and the sense of agency should occur at different stages in the normal generation of willed actions. Both these processes have been associated with a fronto-parietal motor network, but no study has investigated to what extent the two experiences can be dissociated for the brain regions involved. To this end, we assessed the PET\/fMRI literature on agency and intentionality using a meta-analytic technique based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Beside a shared brain network involving the meso-frontal and prefrontal regions, the middle insula and subcortical structures, we found that motor intention and the sense of agency are functionally underpinned by separable sets of brain regions: an \u201cintentionality network,\u201d involving the rostral area of the mesial frontal cortex (middle cingulum and pre-supplementary motor area), the anterior insula and the parietal lobules, and a \u201cself-agency network,\u201d which involves the posterior areas of the mesial frontal cortex (the SMA proper), the posterior insula, the occipital lobe and the cerebellum. We were then able to confirm this functional organization by a subsequent seed-based fMRI resting-state functional connectivity analysis, with seeds derived from the intentionality\/sense of agency specific clusters of the medial wall of the frontal lobe. Our results suggest the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient within the mesial frontal cortex, with the more anterior regions linked to the concept of motor intentionality and the brain areas located more posteriorly associated with the direct monitoring between the action and its outcome. This suggestion is reinforced by the association between the sense of agency and the activation of the occipital lobes, to suggest a direct comparison between the movement and its external (e.g., visual) consequences. The shared network may be important for the integration of intentionality and agency in a coherent appreciation of self-generated actions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVolitional or voluntary actions are crucial components of our daily life and they could be defined as \u201cself-initiated\u201d or \u201cself-generated\u201d actions ( ). Although much of the functioning of the voluntary motor systems occurs without the need of any conscious thought, humans are aware that they intend to move and are responsible for the consequences of their own acts. Our intentions to produce a movement (the so-called \u201cmotor intention\u201d or volition) and the feeling of controlling our own motor acts and, through them, the events in the external world (the so-called \u201csense of agency\u201d), represent two crucial components of the action awareness for voluntary acts. \n\nWe first describe in detail the concepts of motor intention and sense of agency, how they have been experimentally manipulated and their corresponding brain correlates as they would emerge from a traditional review of the literature. We then address two cognitive models that contextualized motor intention and sense of agency into different conceptual frameworks, from which distinct predictions about their neurofunctional underpinnings could be drawn. Finally, we introduce a formal meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, that specifically tested these neurofunctional predictions and the validity of functional anatomical assignations in terms of their replicability across studies and dissociability along the intentionality\/agency axes. \n\n### The Conscious Motor Intention \n  \nMotor intentionality refers to the reasons that bring a subject to produce a specific action: indeed, intentional actions (e.g., actions that are caused by conscious intentionality) are defined as goal-directed, not externally triggered, not habitual and not automatic ( ). \n\nThus, they have been conceptualized as a form of motor decision making, free from the external constraints defined by sensory cues ( ). According to this approach, the dominant experimental setting for studying motor intention requires subjects to decide between different action alternatives in three main ways: each participant can be asked to choose which action to perform among a set of alternatives ( ), or to execute a specific action choosing the timing of the movement ( ), by taking advantage of the Libet\u2019s paradigm ( ), or to decide whether to perform or to inhibit an action ( ). Functional imaging studies of motor intention have frequently shown activations in the anterior portion of the pre-SMA ( ), in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( ,  ), in the SMA proper ( ;  ), in the superior ( ) and inferior ( ) parietal lobules, in the insular cortex ( ) and in the cerebellum ( ). \n\n\n### The Sense of Agency \n  \nThe sense of agency is another central aspect of action awareness and refers to the ability to recognize that an external sensory event has been caused by our behavior (self-agency) rather than by an external agent (external-agency). \n\n distinguished between two distinct forms of agency experience: the \u201cjudgment of agency\u201d and the \u201cfeeling of agency.\u201d The \u201cjudgment of agency\u201d refers to the conceptual, interpretative, explicit judgments of being the agent of an outcome (\u201cDid I do that?\u201d). The \u201cfeeling of agency\u201d represents the non-conceptual, implicit feeling of control that accompanies their own actions, in the absence of any conscious thought. \n\nThe dominant experimental paradigm addressing the \u201cjudgment of agency\u201d involves the request of performing explicit judgments about whether a sensory event has been caused by one\u2019s action (self-agency) or by another agent (external-agency). Typically, participants perform hand movements, see video feedbacks showing the target motor act and judge whether they are viewing their own action or not, basing either on spatial ( ) or temporal ( ) features of the seen movements, which could be experimentally manipulated. However, although explicit judgments of agency may be crucial in social contexts in which the attribution of the agency has important consequences in the domain of responsibility, our everyday experience of agency does not generally involve explicit judgments ( ). For this reason, the type of experience that can be captured by an overt rating can differ considerably from our ordinary sense of agency. Accordingly, the \u201cfeeling of agency\u201d has been investigated by means of implicit paradigms, which are able to capture this feeling without requiring people to overtly think about their agency. For example, in experiments taking advantage of the \u201cintentional binding\u201d effect, participants are asked to report the perceived time either of the action or of a subsequent sensory event ( , for a critical review see also  ). Alternatively, the perceptual attenuation of the self-generated action consequences has been used as an implicit measure of the feeling of agency. This effect, defined as \u201csensory attenuation\u201d ( ;  ), refers to the subjective perception of a self-generated sensory stimulus as less intense than an identical externally generated stimulus. \n\nNeuroimaging studies, mainly based on explicit agency judgments, have shown the association between the self-agency and the activity of the pre-SMA ( ), the SMA proper ( ;  ), the superior ( ) and inferior parietal lobules ( ;  ), the insular cortex ( ) and the cerebellum ( ;  ). \n\nAt the nominal level, the comparison between these neuroimaging findings and those concerning motor intentionality reveal a great degree of overlap. The remaining question on whether these could be dissociated on a finer anatomical grain represents the issue that we will address in the empirical part of this manuscript. \n\n\n### Models of Conscious Experience of Voluntary Action \n  \nThe conscious experience of motor intention and agency have been contextualized in different theoretical frameworks. It is still unclear whether motor intention and agency might be underpinned by a shared general-domain reconstructive process ( ) or by two partially-independent cognitive processes or stages of action awareness ( ;  ;  ). According to the first framework, the two phenomena would result from a unique cognitive process of   post hoc   reconstructive attribution ( ). The second framework suggests that they might rely on different constructive processes based on the generation of specific internal models and predictions ( ;  ;  ). \n\n#### The Reconstruction of Action Awareness: The Theory of Apparent Mental Causation \n  \nThe \u201ctheory of apparent mental causation\u201d posits a reconstructive view of the conscious experience of voluntary action ( ).   conceptualizes the conscious experience of acting as a   post ho  c inference, occurring after the end of the movements ( ). The inference occurs in accordance with three main principles: priority, consistency, exclusivity. If (1) a thought becomes conscious just before an action (  priority  ), (2) the thought is consistent with the action (  consistency  ) and (3) it is not accompanied by alternative apparent causes of the action (  exclusivity  ), we experience conscious intention and ascribe authorship to ourselves for the action. We do not have access to any direct signal about the true intention to perform an action and we do not use it when the sense of agency is generated ( ). To use the words of Patrick Haggard reviewing this model, \u201c  if I first feel my finger moving  ,   and then hear an auditory tone  ,   I will infer a conscious intention to move  ,   and reconstruct the intention as being the cause of both movement and the tone  \u201d (2003). Accordingly, Wegner\u2019s view suggests that the mind can produce both the tricks that \u201cI\u201d have caused external events and \u201cI\u201d had a preceding intention to make an action ( ). Therefore, intention and agency experiences could be both seen as a result of a shared   post ho  c reconstruction occurring after the end of the movement; they could both be considered as an \u201cillusion of mental causation\u201d retrospectively inferred to explain behavior, rather than a direct report of the pre-motor brain activity ( ). This theory has received some support from studies showing the easily-biased nature of action awareness in situations of ambiguous authorship ( ;  ). For example, an experiment by   demonstrates that particular environmental circumstances can lead subjects to erroneously perceive the intention of performing actions that are actually not caused by them. In that study, both subjects and external agents could be plausible causes of given action outcomes. Within such context, an acoustically presented prime encouraged subjects to retrospectively attribute to themselves conscious intentions of actions that were performed by another person. \n\n\n#### The Construction of Action Awareness: The Comparator Model \n  \nAction awareness can also be explained in the framework of computational models of movement control, such as the comparator model ( ;  ;  ). \n\nCentral to the comparator model is the idea that the motor control system makes use of internal models which internally represent the motor-to-sensory transformations and how these are implemented in the physical world. There are two main types of internal models underpinning motor control: inverse and forward models. The control of action mainly depends on the coupling of these internal models through a series of comparators, namely mechanisms that compare signals and use the result of the comparison for the regulation of the system. Accordingly, an action starts with an intention or a desired goal state. An inverse model computes the appropriate motor commands that are required to achieve the desired goal from the current state of the system and the environment. A forward model represents the causal flow of the ongoing motor process and uses the so-called \u201cefference copy\u201d of the current motor program to make predictions of the sensory consequences of the ongoing movement. These predictions are then compared with the real outcomes of the actions ( ). This mechanism can be used to (1) adjust the current motor command in order to rapidly correct the movements, to (2) attribute the agency for the produced action outcomes, to (3) cancel out or attenuate sensory feedbacks that are self-produced, the phenomenon known as \u201csensory attenuation\u201d ( ;  ). In particular, if predicted and estimated actual state are congruent, the sensory event is attributed to one\u2019s own agency, while a mismatch prevents the consequence to be attributed to one\u2019s own action ( ). For what concerns the sensory attenuation phenomenon, such effect is supposed to occur when the predictions of the outcome of the action make reafferent perception of the actual effect redundant ( ). \n\nIn a nutshell, two crucial arguments are particularly useful for our attempt to characterize action awareness. First, the comparator model suggests a strict temporal structure in action awareness: motor intention precedes the preparation of the motor act, which necessarily precedes the movement of the body. The establishment of a link between our motor intentions and our actions and between our actions and their external outcomes determines the sense of agency ( ). Second, the comparator model, by directly connecting action awareness to action perception and motor processes, could be a parsimonious explanation of the conscious experience of action, since it is able to explain it as an intrinsic property of action processing ( ). \n\n\n#### The Neural Predictions of the Models \n  \nAlthough the authors of the two aforementioned models did not overtly propose specific neurofunctional predictions, the two frameworks allow us to hypothesize different sets of neuroanatomical patterns associated with motor intention and agency. \n\nAccording to the reconstructive view, action awareness may arise from an inferential \u2018sense-making\u2019 process, which uses sensory evidence about physical events in order to reconstruct the intention and the agency of the action after its execution. As a consequence, as   hypothesized in her work on the phenomenology of action, the theory of apparent mental causation implies that the process of action awareness generation should be considered as separated from the process involved in action specification and control. Conversely, this might result from the same mental processes typically involved in a general appreciation of causality, which process environmental and contextual cues to infer causality ( ). \n\nConsequently, the following neuroanatomical predictions might be hypothesized: first, the existence of a shared neural network implied in the formation of the feelings of intentionality and agency; second, the involvement of non-motoric neural systems in the retrospective reconstruction of causality. \n\nAlternatively, action awareness might depend on a constructive process, depending on consecutive analytical steps taking advantage of efferent motor command signals. As a consequence, the comparator model allows one to hypothesize a different functional anatomical scenario whereby the translation of general goals into specific motor intentions and the occurrence of the sense of agency should be associated with partially-distinct brain network, deeply embedded in the sensory-motor system. Two additional predictions complement this argument. First, one should expect a reduced activity associated with the self-produced movements in the sensory cortices, according to the sensory attenuation hypothesis. Second, the comparator model necessarily needs to consider the problem of how \u201cmotor intention\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d specific networks interact. One possibility is that this might occur by means of effective connectivity through separate systems. Alternatively, one could predict a shared set of brain regions at the interface between the intention and the agency-specific processes. This latter possibility is suggested by the assumption that the sense of agency should partly depend on the experience of intentionality itself ( ). \n\nAnatomical considerations on the nature of the areas that may prove to be significantly involved in intention and agency experiences may ease the interpretations of anatomical findings and their explanatory power in favor of the aforementioned theories: for example, a systematic and exclusive involvement in action awareness of regions connected with the spinal cord may pull the argument in favor of a motoric interpretation whereby the motor signals explicitly contribute to the construction of such mental state, a position much closer to the comparator hypothesis. The impossibility of separating \u201cintention specific\u201d brain areas form those implicated with agency would rather militate in favor of a cognitive reappraisal theory \u2013   post hoc   \u2013 reconstruction of the consequences of actions as self-generated. \n\n\n\n### Aim of the Study \n  \nTo date, the two cognitive constructs of motor intention and sense of agency have never been manipulated together in the same experimental context with neuroimaging measures, mainly due to the lack -at present- of neuroimaging techniques with sufficient spatio-temporal resolution to capture the neurofunctional correlates of so closely interwoven constructs. One other possibility is to rely on a quantitative assessment of the results of specific experiments in which intentionality or agency have been studied separately using a strict cognitive subtraction approach. \n\nTo this end, we adopted a meta-analytical approach that allowed us to formally compare, with statistical measures, the neural correlates of motor intention and sense of agency, their overlap and dissociations. \n\nWe reasoned that the assessment of the degree of overlap and dissociations of the neural correlates of the two constructs and the nature of the recruited networks, would have proved useful in disentangling the anatomical foundations of motor intention and the experience of agency and tell whether we should favor a unitary retrospective mechanism (Wegner\u2019s view), or a mechanism more akin to those postulated by the comparator model. \n\n\n\n## Materials, Methods, and Results \n  \nIn this paper, we adopted a two-level analysis strategy. We first performed an explorative meta-analysis of the existing neuroimaging literature on action awareness by means of a hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, in order to provide a quantitative review of the neuroimaging studies on motor intention and sense of self-agency. To this aim, we identified the eligible studies, based on the degree of overlap with our research question. We then extracted and classified the coordinates according to the type of contrasts defined in each study. We finally applied a HC algorithm to the dataset, followed by statistical inferences on the resulting clusters. \n\nWe employed the HC procedure in order to overcome the disproportion of peaks associated with the two levels of the factor of interest within the source dataset. In fact, the HC method has the advantage of allowing the statistical exploration of each resulting cluster (cluster composition analysis) by comparing the proportion of the foci belonging to either level of the factor of interest within each cluster with the overall distribution of foci in the whole dataset. By applying this prior likelihood estimate of the expected number of foci in any given cluster under the null hypothesis, given the overall proportions of construct specific foci, we were able to efficiently handle the greater number of foci associated with the motor intention level compared with the sense of self-agency one and still perform our inferences (see below for the details). \n\nTwo subsequent analyses complemented this explorative meta-analysis: a conjunction analysis between the motor intention and the sense of agency data set, and a cluster analysis focused on the sense of external-agency, in order to test the sensory attenuation hypothesis formulated by the comparator model of action. \n\nFinally we implemented a confirmative analysis, where the main results of the HC analysis were employed as ROIs for a resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC) analysis of fMRI data, in order to further characterize the functional networks involved in action awareness and to add some face validity to our anatomical inferences based on a totally independent data set. Functional connectivity refers to the functionally integrated relationship between spatially separated brain regions. Indeed, whereas our meta-analytical approach allows us to describe different sets of brain regions selectively associated to the performance of \u201cmotor intention task\u201d or \u201cagency task,\u201d the rsFC analysis allows a deeper and task-free functional characterization of such brain networks. These procedures are described in detail below. \n\n### Explorative Meta-Analysis \n  \n#### Methods \n  \n##### Data collection and preparation \n  \nFirst, we interrogated the PubMed database  in April 2018  with the following keywords: \u201cMotor intention and fMRI,\u201d \u201cMotor intention and PET,\u201d \u201cMotor intention and neuroimaging\u201d and \u201cSense of agency and fMRI,\u201d \u201cSense of Agency and PET,\u201d \u201cSense of agency and neuroimaging\u201d for the two datasets, respectively. \n\nSecond, we performed a detailed inspection of the resulting manuscripts and we excluded the studies that did not report data by using stereotactic coordinates (either MNI \u2013 Montreal Neurological Institute \u2013 or Talairach atlases) and did not recruit only healthy adult subjects. \n\nThe final dataset included 17 studies that investigated the functional correlates of motor intention and 14 studies that explored the sense of self-agency (see  ), for a total of 342 peaks of activation. The studies addressing motor intention have mostly employed neuroimaging procedures similar to the \u201cFree selection paradigm\u201d ( ), in which two experimental conditions are compared: a condition in which responses are externally determined by a cue and a condition in which the participants have to choose freely between different motor responses. On the other hand, the brain correlates of the sense of agency have been mainly investigated by manipulating the visual feedback of the movement. In order to functionally characterize each cluster by means of a subsequent cluster composition analysis, each peak within the dataset was classified according to the two levels of the only factor of interest (action awareness): motor intention and sense of self-agency. In particular, 246 peaks were associated with motor intention and 96 peaks were associated with the sense of self-agency. We employed the activation foci resulting from simple comparison between the factor of interest and the control condition [e.g., intentional action > rest condition; intentional action > stimulus-driven action; self-agency (visuo-motor congruency) > rest; self-agency (visuo-motor congruency) > external-agency (visuo-motor discrepancy)] and parametric regressions (e.g., parametric function of the BOLD response as a function of visuo-motor congruency degree). For a more detailed contrast characterization see the  . Further, all the Talairach coordinates were converted to MNI space through the Talairach to MNI (SPM) transformation implemented in the software CluB (Clustering the Brain, see below). \n\nThe final dataset included 474 participants (mean age = 27.35 \u00b1 4) and 34 contrasts. \n\n\n##### Cluster analysis and cluster composition analysis: motor intention and sense of self-agency \n  \nTo identify anatomically coherent regional effects, we first performed a cluster analysis using the unique-solution clustering algorithm developed by  . This method, implemented in a suite of MATLAB (2014a MathWorks) and C++ scripts called \u201cCluB\u201d (the CluB software can be found here ), takes into account the squared Euclidian distance between each couple of foci included in the dataset; the clusters with minimal dissimilarity are then recursively merged by means of the Ward\u2019s criterion ( ), with the aim of minimizing the intra-cluster variability and maximizing the between-cluster variability ( ). \n\nThe spatial resolution of our analyses was set to be of 5 mm, corresponding to the maximum mean spatial variance within each cluster in the three directions. The output of the cluster analysis was then employed to perform the subsequent cluster composition analysis. This procedure allows a non-parametric   post hoc   exploration of the composition of each cluster, providing a statistical account of the degree of association of each cluster with the levels of the factor of interest. In particular, after extracting the proportion of peaks associated with the factors of interest within the whole dataset, the software computes the proportion of activation peaks belonging to either factor within each cluster. Then, the proportions observed within each cluster are compared to the overall prior likelihood with a binomial test, under the null hypothesis that the proportion of foci within each cluster is different from the prior likelihood. \n\nAfter the clustering procedure, the centroid coordinates of each resulting cluster were labeled according to the Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) and then manually checked by visual inspection using the MRIcron  ( ) software. \n\n\n##### Activation likelihood estimation conjunction analysis: motor intention and sense of agency \n  \nThe HC procedure does not allow a statistical characterization of the conjunction between the clustering results, in order to identify the voxels commonly associated with both the two levels of interest. This limit has been circumvented by employing the ALE conjunction analysis provided by the Ginger-ALE software ( ;  ), that creates a conjunction image using the voxel-wise minimum value of the input ALE images (see for example,  ). \n\nWe first conducted two separate ALE analyses, one focused on motor intention and one on the sense of self-agency. We employed the Turkeltaub Non-Additive method ( ) with the general statistical threshold set to   p   < 0.05 (uncorrected), resulting in an ALE map and in a corresponding cluster report. Conjunction analysis was then carried out to determine the intersection between the meta-analyses on intentionality and agency. We employed a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 FDR (pID) corrected for multiple comparisons and a cluster-size threshold of 300 mm , such that only clusters of contiguous voxels exceeding a volume of 300 mm  were considered. All the ALE meta-analyses were conducted in the standard MNI space ( ;  ). The maps of the ALE values were overlaid on a ch2better.nii.gz template using MRIcron software ( ). \n\n\n##### Cluster analysis: external-agency (sensory attenuation hypothesis) \n  \nTo test the hypothesis that self-generated actions (self-agency) are associated with reduced activations at the level of the sensory cortices with respect to externally-generated movements (external-agency), we created a separate database listing only the activation foci that resulted from the following contrasts: external-agency > rest, external-agency > self-agency. The final dataset included 11 studies that investigated the sense of external-agency, with 142 peaks of activation (see  ). No similar analysis was possible for the fMRI signal reductions in the intentionality studies as the data available were a mere 53 peaks from 8 studies. \n\nThe cluster analysis procedure, with one factor characterized by only one level, does not allow to make any statistical inference on the clustering results. This limit has been previously circumvented by combining the HC approach with the ALE procedure ( ) provided by the Ginger-ALE software ( ;  ). \n\nFor the spatial cross-validation ALE we employed the Turkeltaub Non-Additive method ( ), with the general statistical threshold set to   p   < 0.05 FDR (pID); the resulting maps were overlapped with the cluster analysis map with the \u201cintersection\u201d function in the software MRIcron ( ). Only the clusters that fell in this intersection map were further discussed. The overlapping clusters have been marked with an asterisk in  . \n\n\n\n#### Results \n  \n##### Cluster analysis and cluster composition analysis: motor intention and sense of self-agency \n  \nThe cluster analysis yielded 68 clusters (CL), containing on average 5 foci (range: 1\u201317 peaks). The mean standard deviation along the three axes was 4.44 mm (  x  -axis), 4.70 mm (  y  -axis), and 4.95 mm (  z  -axis). See  . \n\nThe clusters resulting from the HC procedure were then submitted to the cluster composition analysis to test the degree of association between each cluster and each level of the factor of interest, by means of a binomial test. The results revealed that five clusters were significantly associated with motor intention and four with the sense of self-agency. See   and  . \n  \nResults of the cluster composition analysis: motor intention vs. sense of self-agency. \n      \nMeta-analytical results: motor intention and sense of self-agency. The green clusters are significantly associated with motor intention, the blue clusters are significantly linked to the sense of self-agency while the yellow clusters are the ones shared by motor intention and the sense of self-agency. \n  \nMotor intention specific clusters were located in the right inferior parietal lobule (CL22), in the left anterior insula (CL41), in the right superior parietal lobule (CL45), in the right middle cingulum (CL53) and in the left pre-SMA (CL58). See   and   (areas in green). \n\nSelf-agency specific clusters were found in the left SMA (CL24), in the left posterior insula (CL28), in the right calcarine fissure (CL59) and in the right cerebellum (CL67). See   and   (areas in blue). \n\n\n##### Activation likelihood estimation conjunction analysis: motor intention and sense of self-agency \n  \nThe conjunction analysis returned 14 clusters, with a mean extension of 766.3 mm  and an ALE score of 0.005\u20130.009. In particular, the bilateral middle insula (CL1 and CL2), the left (CL3 and 10) and right (CL14) putamen, the left precentral gyrus (CL4), the left middle cingulum (CL5), the right SMA proper (CL6), the left middle frontal gyrus (CL7), the right superior parietal lobule (CL8), the right anterior cingulum (CL9), the left thalamus (CL11), the left superior frontal gyrus (CL12) and the right calcarine scissure (CL13) represented a network shared by motor intention and the sense of self-agency. See   and   (areas in yellow). \n  \nResults of the ALE conjunction analysis: motor intention and sense of self-agency. \n    \nIt is worth noting that these areas of shared local effects overlap with some of the clusters identified with CluB where the value of the binomial test was very far from significance in any direction, to testify a similar proportion of peaks from motor intention and the self-agency datasets. See  . \n\nThe advantage of the ALE approach here was to allow an inference about significance to the level of overlap of the separate regional effects. \n\n\n##### Cluster analysis: external-agency (sensory attenuation hypothesis) \n  \nThe cluster analysis yielded three clusters, containing on average 7.7 foci (range: 7\u20139 peaks). The mean standard deviation along the three axes was 4.3 mm (  x  -axis), 5.0 mm (  y  -axis), and 4.9 mm (  z  -axis). \n\nThese clusters were located in the left inferior parietal lobule, in the right superior temporal gyrus and in the right angular gyrus. See   and  . \n  \nResults of the cluster analysis: external agency. \n      \nMeta-analysis results: external-agency. The clusters significantly associated with the sense of external-agency are depicted in red. \n  \n\n\n\n### Confirmative Analysis: Functional Connectivity Data \n  \n#### Motivation \n  \nThe results of the HC and ALE analyses are very encouraging in indicating that the \u201cmotor intention\u201d and the \u201cagency\u201d networks can be teased apart one from the other, yet with some substantial overlap. If these functional anatomical patterns are somewhat hard-wired, one should be able to demonstrate such separations and convergence also on an independent data-set; this could be done taking advantage of fMRI resting-state functional data, using a seed-based rsFC analysis focused on the main clusters identified by the HC analysis. We focused this analysis on the pre-SMA and the SMA proper, as they have a crucial role in planning and initiating a voluntary action ( ;  ), in the consciousness of motor intention ( ) and in the explicit ( ) and implicit ( ) experience of agency. Finally, our previous HC analysis suggested a rostro-caudal gradient within the mesial wall of the frontal lobe that we wanted to test some further. \n\n\n#### Methods \n  \n##### Participants \n  \nThirty-two subjects (mean age: 27.52 \u00b1 5.7 years; mean education level 14.84 \u00b1 3.2 years; 12 males and 20 females) without any cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric illness participated in the resting-state fMRI study. They were all right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness inventory ( ). Each subject was asked to stay with their eyes closed, awake and, as far as possible, not to think about anything. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee ASL Citt\u00e0 di Milano, and informed written consent was obtained from all subjects. \n\n\n##### fMRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \nMRI scanning was performed with a Siemens   Avanto   1.5T scanner equipped with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging. Before the acquisition of functional data, high-resolution T1-weighted structural images were acquired (flip angle 35\u00b0, TE 5 ms, TR 21 ms, FOV 256 \u00d7 192 mm, matrix 256 \u00d7 256, TI 768, 160 slices with 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm voxels). Echo-planar imaging gradient-echo fMRI scans [flip angle 90\u00b0, echo time (TE) = 60 ms, TR = 3000 ms, field of view = 250 \u00d7 250 mm, and matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 4 mm] were then acquired (212 volumes). The first 10 volumes of each sequence were discarded from the analyses. \n\n\n##### Data analysis \n  \nStatistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 12  , in conjunction with Functional Connectivity (CONN) toolbox   software were used for data analysis. \n\nThe pre-processing of resting-state fMRI data was conducted according to the default pipeline included in CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity toolbox (version 18  ) including realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction, outlier detection (Artifact Detection Tool, conservative settings: 95 percentiles in normative sample), structural segmentation and normalization, functional normalization, smoothing (10-mm Gaussian kernel) and band-pass filtering (0.008 <   f   < 0.09 Hz) to reduce the effect of low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. \n\nThe CONN toolbox then used a component-based noise correction method (CompCor) to identify and remove the principal components of physiological and other sources of noises from white matter and cerebral spinal fluid. Additionally, the confounding effect of the movement-related parameters (six dimensions with their first order derivative) was removed. \n\nIn the first level analysis, the toolbox computes the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the time course of the fMRI signal of the seed regions selected and the time course of each voxel in the brain separately to generate the parametric seed-to-voxel correlation map. A seed-to-voxel correlation map was computed for each subject for each seed. Correlation coefficients were then converted to   z  -scores using the Fischer\u2019s transform to allow for subsequent GLM analysis. \n\nTwo analyses were made, one for each of the two seeds regions from the medial wall of the frontal lobe that were specifically associated with intentionality (pre-SMA) and agency (SMA proper). \n\nFollowing the first level analysis, each seed-to-voxel correlation map (one for each subject) were imported from the CONN toolbox in SPM12 for further analysis. \n\nIn the second-level analysis  ,   the connectivity maps of the pre-SMA\/SMA from all participants were compared by means of a paired   t  -test. \n\nThe analyses identified regions that showed a difference in functional connectivity between seed\/condition specific maps: the comparison pre-SMA  map > SMA  map identified areas of functional connectivity more related with the motor intention network; the comparison SMA  map > pre-SMA  map identified areas of functional connectivity more closely associated with the self-agency network. \n\nFinally, as for the meta-analysis, to identify potentials areas of overlap in the connectivity maps, we also run a conjunction analysis between the simple effects of the connectivity maps based on the pre-SMA  specific cluster and those emerging for the SMA  specific cluster. \n\nThe regions described survived a canonical cluster-level FWE   p   < 0.05 correction (voxelwise uncorrected threshold:   p   < 0.001), in line with recent suggestions by  . \n\n\n\n#### Results \n  \nThe seed located in the pre-SMA, associated with motor intention studies, was specifically connected with the anterior cingulum bilaterally, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left precentral gyrus and the left anterior insula. See  , areas in green, and  . \n  \nFunctional connectivity results: brain regions specifically functionally connected with the pre-SMA (intentionality network) are depicted in green, the brain areas specifically functionally connected with the SMA (self-agency network) are depicted in blue, while the network shared by the pre-SMA (intentionality network) and the SMA (self-agency network) are depicted in yellow. \n  \nOn the contrary, the portion of SMA significantly associated with the sense of agency (SMA proper) was connected with the paracentral and postcentral gyrus bilaterally, the left middle cingulum, the right precentral gyrus and the right superior parietal lobule. See  , areas in blue, and  . \n\nThe conjunction analysis between the connectivity maps revealed a shared network involving the bilateral middle cingulum, the bilateral SMA, the bilateral anterior, middle and posterior insula, the bilateral superior temporal pole, the left inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis, the left middle frontal gyrus, the left anterior cingulum, the left supramarginal gyrus and the left putamen. See  , areas in yellow, and  : these illustrate the high level of congruency of the results generated by the meta-analyses and the seed-based functional connectivity maps on the independent resting state fMRI data. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study was conducted in order to deepen the investigation of the neurofunctional underpinnings of action awareness, by formally exploring, as quantitatively as possible, the available fMRI\/PET literature. We focused our attention on the crucial components that define action awareness, motor intention and the sense of agency, and on two cognitive models that contextualize these two concepts in different frameworks. \n\nCurrent theories suggest two possible processes at the basis of conscious awareness for voluntary acts: action awareness may arise from an inferential \u2018sense-making\u2019 process, which uses sensory evidence about physical events in order to reconstruct the intention and the authorship of the action after its execution ( ); alternatively, action awareness might depend on a constructive process, depending on efferent motor command signals ( ). \n\nThere are crucial differences between the reconstructive ( ) and the constructive ( ) views of action awareness: according to the reconstructive view, conscious experience of action is essentially a retrospective \u201cillusion\u201d; conversely, the constructive view postulates that it is an important aspect of sensorimotor neural activity, which can be experimentally approached as a motor phenomenon ( ). \n\nThe two models loosely imply certain non-equivalent functional anatomical predictions, and a meta-analysis has the advantage, at the very least, to make inferences about findings that repeat themselves, if they do, and to quantify the reliability of such repeats. \n\nWith this in mind, we can now discuss our findings also in the light of the reconstructive and constructive views described before. \n\n### Common or Distinct Neural Substrates for Motor Intention and Sense of Agency? \n  \n#### HC Data \n  \nOur results show the existence of a common brain network shared by motor intention and the sense of self-agency, involving a diffuse neural system including premotor and prefrontal areas, such as the left superior and middle frontal gyri, the right anterior cingulum, the left middle cingulum, the right SMA, the left precentral gyrus, but also areas outside the frontal lobe at the level of the middle insula bilaterally, the right superior parietal lobule, the right calcarine scissure and in subcortical structures, such as the left thalamus and the bilateral putamen. \n\nBeyond this shared network, we highlighted a segregation of the neural circuits associated with action awareness. In particular, our results suggest the existence of a rostro-caudal gradient in the mesial frontal cortex: the more anterior regions, such as the pre-SMA, associated with the experience of intentionality, a more posterior region of SMA resulted shared by motor intention and the sense of agency and, finally, the more posterior areas, such as the SMA proper, specifically related to the sense of agency. The association of the pre-SMA to the concept of intentionality is consistent with the shared area of activation of three intentional tasks reported in  , a study that has been published after the conclusion of these analyses and not included here. \n\nFurthermore, our results suggest the existence of a second rostro-caudal gradient in the brain areas supporting action awareness, located in the insular cortex. In particular, while the insular anterior region was significantly associated with the experience of intentionality, the middle insula was shared by the motor intention and sense of self-agency studies and the posterior insula was specifically linked to the feeling of self-agency. \n\nThe dissociation between intentionality and agency involved also brain regions well outside the median wall of the frontal lobe and the insular cortex, in a functionally-specific manner. For example, for motor intention the data clustered in the right middle cingulum and in the right parietal lobules. For what concerns the agency experience, our data clustered also in the right occipital lobe and in the right cerebellum. \n\n\n#### Functional Connectivity Data \n  \nWe then focused our analyses on the most interesting functional dissociation emerging from our data, located in the frontal midline: the dissociations between pre-SMA and SMA proper. We focused this analysis on such regions as they have a crucial role in planning and initiating a voluntary action ( ;  ), in the consciousness of motor intention ( ) and in the explicit ( ) and implicit ( ) experience of agency. Finally, our previous HC analysis suggested a rostro-caudal gradient within the mesial wall of the frontal lobe that we wanted to test some further. \n\nThese clusters (centroids: pre-SMA MNI: -3, 12, 53,   sd  : 7.1, 6.5, 2.5; SMA MNI: -7, -4, 69,   sd  : 4.7, 5.0, 5.0) were used to compute seed-to-voxel connectivity maps in a sample of 32 healthy adult volunteers: this analysis can be regarded as complementary and confirmative with respect to the meta-analytical one. Indeed, whereas our meta-analytical analysis allows the quantitative description of the brain areas which have proven to be active during the performance of tasks differently associated with motor intention and the sense of self-agency, the functional connectivity analysis experimentally defines a set of regions whose activity correlates with one of the selected ROI. In other words, it allows the definition of the functional networks in which the ROIs are involved ( ). \n\nThe results of this analysis showed a wide overlap with the HC data and further supported the dissociation between the neural network associated with intentionality and the network linked to the sense of agency. In particular, the pre-SMA associated with motor intention proved to be functionally connected with a set of frontal and prefrontal areas, such as the anterior cingulum and the inferior frontal areas and the anterior insula. Conversely, the SMA proper, specific for the sense of self-agency, was linked to the sensorimotor areas, such as the postcentral gyrus and the posterior insula. \n\nMuch as in the conjunction analysis performed in the meta-analysis section, the rsFC data confirmed also regions of intersection at the inner boundaries of the two specific networks. \n\nTaken together, this evidence suggests that, outside a common network shared by both levels of action awareness, motor intention and the agency experiences are functionally underpinned by two partially distinct neural network: an \u201cintentionality network\u201d involving the rostral area of the mesial frontal cortex, the anterior insula and the inferior parietal lobule and an \u201cself-agency network,\u201d which involves the posterior areas of the mesial frontal cortex (the SMA proper) and the posterior insula. \n\nIn the next paragraph, we will discuss the dissociation between the \u201cintentionality network\u201d and the \u201cself-agency network\u201d with reference to their distinctive features. \n\n\n\n### How Can the Regions Specifically Associated With Motor Intention and Sense of Self-Agency Be Defined From a Functional Point of View? \n  \nOur results are consistent with the view that the mesial frontal areas (pre-SMA and middle cingulum), the anterior insula and the parietal lobes jointly represent a circuit which elaborates motor plans in advance of the action, producing a conscious experience of motor intention. On the contrary, our data suggest that a different set of brain regions, including the SMA proper, the posterior insula, the occipital lobe and the cerebellum, sustain our sense of self-agency. \n\nThese networks differ in their distinctive features: the \u201cintentional network\u201d might be conceptualized as a high-level cognitive system, one step or two steps away from detailed action planning or implementation; the \u201cself-agency network\u201d could be seen as a \u201csensorimotor\u201d system. \n\nIn line with these ideas, the pre-SMA belongs to the prefrontal network, rather than to the premotor one ( ); it is strongly connected with prefrontal cortices and high-level motor areas and it has a specific role in the performance of complex tasks, such as alternation of motor plans, task switching, acquisition of new motor skills and motor selection ( ,  ;  ). Similarly, the anterior part of the cingulate cortex (BA 24 and 32), also associated with motor intention, has been defined as \u201cthe cognitive division\u201d of the cingulate cortex; it can be distinguished from the posterior one based for its cytoarchitecture, patterns of connectivity and functions ( ;  ): it plays a role in high-level executive functions, such as response selection and conflict monitoring ( ). Likewise, the anterior insula, given its connections with the frontal and limbic regions ( ) and self-referential cognitive ( ) or emotional functions ( ), is regarded as the \u201ccognitive\u201d portion of the insular cortex ( ;  ). \n\nOn the other hand, the SMA proper, associated with the self-agency-network, can be considered as a typical pre-motor area: this region is somatotopically organized and it projects directly to the primary motor cortex (M1) and spinal cord ( ), and it is functionally connected with regions related to simple motor control ( ). The posterior insula, another region linked to the same network, is involved in different sensorimotor processes ( ): it is involved in sensory processing ( ) and its electrical stimulation in humans produces overt movement elicitation ( ). \n\nTaken together, evidence from functional data suggests that these two networks may be partially dissociated with respect to both their anatomical and functional features, with \u201ccognitive\u201d motor functions being represented in the intentional network and \u201cexecutive\u201d motor functions in the agency one ( ). In the next paragraph, we will discuss this evidence with reference to the different models of action awareness. \n\n\n### Do the Available Data Permit to Identify a Best Fitting Theory of Action Awareness? \n  \nOur findings are directly relevant to the aforementioned cognitive models of action awareness and, more in general, to a theoretical account of motor control. In particular, such complex scenario is partially in contrast with the retrospective framework of action awareness ( ), which considers motor intention and the sense of agency as the result of a common general-domain mechanism. According to this view, we should have observed a unique set of non-motoric brain regions, which are meant to be involved in a general appreciation of causality, shared by intention and agency. Our data show the existence of a set of brain regions associated with both the intention and the agency-specific processes; however, this network is not located in the brain areas typically involved in the high-level processing of causality. Moreover, we provide evidence supporting the existence of two separate networks specifically associated with the two constructs. \n\nOur data fit better with the constructive view of the action awareness experience ( ). The comparator model (1) describes motor intention and the sense of agency as distinctive experiences and (2) considers action awareness as an intrinsic property of the action processing that emerges from computational processes similar to those that allow action planning and action-outcome monitoring ( ). Our data comply with these arguments, as (1) the motor intention and the sense of agency experiences have been associated with partially-distinct neurofunctional networks and (2) the regions that were associated with the sense of agency are essentially sensorimotor areas. We suggest that action awareness can be regarded as a complex process, which includes almost two distinctive experiences partially dissociable from the neurocognitive point of view: a cognitive process, such as motor intention, underpinned by a high-level cognitive system, and a process more embedded in the sensory-motor system, associated with distinct neurocognitive mechanisms, such as the sense of agency. The strong link between the sense of agency and the sensory-motor system also emerges from the reduced activation of the posterior parietal regions in self-agency conditions, described by the clustering analysis performed on the external-agency dataset . The reduced activation in posterior parietal regions, involved in high-order processes of sensory, multisensory and sensorimotor integration ( ), is in line with the sensory-attenuation hypothesis put forward by the comparator model: when predictions of the outcome of one\u2019s action make reafferent perception of the actual outcome redundant, the motor system uses the predictions to cancel or attenuate the sensory consequences of the action ( ). \n\nIn a nutshell, the involvement of the sensory-motor system in action consciousness implies that, at least for the simplest motor functions that could be addressed in an experimental setting, awareness is neither the prerogative of some kind of general process, hierarchically superimposed on sensory-motor and cognitive functions (see for example  , \u201cThe interpreter\u201d), nor a function that is completely separated from the primary processes that computes the action program. \n\nHowever, the two cited models might not be considered as mutually exclusive: indeed, components of the two models may play a role in action awareness perhaps in different instances of motor behavior. For example, the retrospective model of awareness could account for action awareness in the context of every-day life events, when the motor plan has been lost due to the temporal distance between action and the need to account for its execution. In this case, we cannot take advantage of the comparison between the predictions and the external feedbacks and we can only rely on a reconstruction of the event authorship and source. However, further studies are needed to support this hypothesis. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAction awareness is a key feature of our mental life, involving, among other things, motor intentionality and sense of agency. \n\nIn this manuscript, we tried to address the hypothesis that the available imaging data could best support one of two popular interpretations on action awareness: the reconstructive model ( ;  ) and the constructive\/comparator model ( ;  ). \n\nAccording to what we found, the second came on top, with many inevitable caveats though: the intrinsic limitations of meta-analyses is one; another caveat comes from the obvious appreciation that any thematic review of additional literature would point to the observation that functional segregations, as those described here, do not imply one-to-one specialization (see the case discussed in  , where the intentionality specific networks were also active in conditional action paradigms). Finally, the distributed nature of these networks indicates the need of more behavioral evidence and paradigms that may lead to the assignations of specific roles to the brain areas involved in conscious action awareness. Studies employing functional imaging using causal models, rather than univariate analyses, or non-invasive brain stimulation could be particularly helpful for this purpose. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nSS, EZ, EP, and LZ reviewed the data for the meta-analyses, performed the analyses, and drafted the manuscript. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6473038,"text_md5":"f3730d78b24d0a336b2ebc31de49ce0a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,78],"journal":[79,92],"publication_year":[94,98],"title":[109,230],"keywords":[244,316],"abstract":[329,2621],"body":[2630,54370]},"batch":2,"pmid":31031676,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2019.00804","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6473038","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6473038"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6473038\">6473038<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6473038  The Brain in (Willed) Action: A Meta-Analytical Comparison of Imaging Studies on Motor Intentionality and Sense of Agency"}

This study meta-analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies about food labels on brand, nature and nutrition. Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), Scopus, and PubMed were queried to identify human fMRI studies written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals and used taste or food related labels. Studies were excluded if they reported no results from taste\/food related stimuli versus control, no task-based fMRI results, or no results from whole-brain analysis. Nineteen studies entered the analysis. Results for the meta-analysis on food nutrition revealed that the precuneus on the right hemisphere was significantly activated, a brain region related to internal mentation of self-consciousness and nutritional evaluation. Results for the overall analysis on all 19 studies, the analysis on food brand, and the analysis on food nature revealed no significant brain regions. Food nutrition labels were generally processed by brain regions related to internal mentation of self-consciousness and nutritional evaluation. However, the neural correlates of labels of food brand and food nature were inconsistent across studies. More future studies are needed to better understand the cognitive processing of different kinds of food labels in our brain. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEating is an essential act of our everyday life, and it involves complicated cognitive appraisal and gustatory evaluation. Multiple meta-analyses have attempted to pool data across studies to identify brain regions responsible for primary tasting ( \u2013 ); for processing visual, taste, and odor food stimuli ( ), food commercials ( ), affect, intensity, and quality of food stimuli ( ), tastants delivered with and without swallowing ( ); for differential processing between hungry and satiated state ( ), male and female ( ), obese and normal weight ( ); and regions targeted by anti-appetite medications ( ). (For a more complete list of meta-analyses on taste and food, please refer to ( )). Meanwhile, different kinds of food label, such as food brand logo, nutritional label, or label about food nature should modulate the cerebral processing of food information. An obvious analogy is graphic cigarette warning label. Some smokers and potential smokers may refrain from taking the cigarettes upon seeing such warning label printed on a pack of cigarettes. Compared to control warnings, it was reported that such graphic warning labels could significantly improve subjects\u2019 motivation to quit smoking, and elicited stronger activation in numerous brain regions ( ). The information provided by a nutritional label may similarly influence consumer behavior. For example, consumers were likely to pay 11% more for a box of cookies with a nutritional label compared to its counterpart without a label ( ). There could be more modulating factors such as consumers\u2019 nutritional knowledge and trust toward the nutrition and health claims ( ,  ). On the other hand, food brand could also affect how much a consumer liked the product and his\/her subsequent purchasing behavior ( ). Understanding the neurobiology underlying such food choice and consumption behavior is obviously beneficial for marketing, nutritional advice, and pharmaceuticals. For instance, the cerebral regions highly related to gustatory processing, such as the insula and orbitofrontal cortex, were activated in response to visual cues of shower gel and dish liquid with beverage-imitating packages ( ). This might explain why some people would unintentionally drink shampoo or other poisonous home products. In fact, anti-appetite medications often targeted the gustatory processing at the insula ( ). Besides, it was found that discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision making and self-control, were activated in response to seeing popular brand logos of foods such as French fries versus corresponding organic brand logos ( ). It is important to know more about the neural correlates of various types of food labels, so that the designs of the food labels can be tested and optimized by neuroimaging evaluations. \n\nHere, three types of food labels were examined: food brand logo, nutritional label, or label about food nature. Food brand logos might trigger a consumer\u2019s memory about the past consumption experience and involve social facets such as brand loyalty. In 1985, the Coca Cola company introduced the so-called \u201cNew Coke\u201d into the market, which was rated more superiorly than the original product in blinded taste tests. However, the word \u201cnew\u201d printed on the can was largely rejected by consumers as they preferred the original image of the can and thus the original \u201cpackage\u201d of Coca Cola including the drink filled into the can ( ). Similarly, it was found that human brain had differential gustatory processing of Coca Cola relative to Pepsi in multiple regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, implying differential drink preference ( ). Meanwhile, nutritional label provides nutritional information of the food product that may influence liking, perception of healthiness, and ultimately food choice. There are three main groups of nutritional labels, traffic light, guideline daily amounts (GDA), and health logos\/ratings ( ). Consumers were more willing to pay for foods tagged with healthy nutritional labels than foods with unhealthy labels ( ). In particular, seeing foods tagged with red (unhealthy) traffic light nutritional label would activate the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in self-control in food choice ( ). Finally, the remaining type of label is about food nature. Food nature has diverse context. One fundamental aspect is food versus non-food. For instance, isovaleric acid is a chemical with a strong odor. It is present in foods (e.g., cheese and apple juice) and also produced by human body, attributing to sweaty smell and foot odor ( ). The smell of isovaleric acid was rated much more unpleasant when it was labeled as body odor compared to labeled as cheddar cheese, with differential activations at the anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala ( ). Apart from food versus non-food, the social\/environment meanings of the food can also be expressed by the labels, such as Halal versus non-Halal for Muslims ( ) was differentiated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, organic versus conventional ( ) was differentiated in the ventral striatum, and fair trade versus conventional ( ) was differentiated in the ventral striatum, cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus. \n\nTherefore, this meta-analytic study pooled data across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analytic approach was selected, which calculated the consistency of significantly activated brain coordinates reported from published studies by means of probability distribution modeling ( ,  ). Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that the neural correlates of food brand logo, nutritional label, and label about food nature would involve the gustatory network, such as the insula and the prefrontal cortex. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nIn May 2022, three databases, Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), Scopus, and PubMed were queried with the following search string: (taste* OR flavo* OR food*) AND (fMRI OR neuroimaging OR \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic\u201d) AND (brand* OR label* OR logo*). For the former two databases, the title, abstract, and keyword fields were searched. Since PubMed does not index keywords, the title and abstract fields were searched. The search yielded 100 papers from WoS, 149 from Scopus, and 64 from PubMed. After excluding duplicates, 178 papers remained. The titles and abstracts of these 178 papers were reviewed to determine their relevance. Papers were eligible if they were (i) original studies written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals; (ii) human fMRI studies; and (iii) using taste or food related labels. Studies were excluded if they reported (i) no results from taste\/food related stimuli versus control; (ii) no task-based fMRI results; or (iii) no results from whole-brain analysis. Finally, 19 studies remained ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ) (  and  ). This study was not pre-registered in PROSPERO or other databases. \n  \nA flow chart that illustrates the literature search. \n    \nDetails of the 19 analyzed studies. \n    \n\n### ALE meta-analysis \n  \nBrain coordinates of reported activations were collected from the included studies. They were subjected to probability distribution modeling to unveil brain regions consistently activated across studies ( ). Some studies mentioned that their coordinates were reported in Talairach space, while other studies reported their coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. For those coordinates reported in Talairach space, the Lancaster transformation ( ) was applied to convert them into MNI space before the analysis. The software GingerALE (version 3.0.2) ( ) was used for such conversion and to conduct the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. The Turkeltaub non-additive ALE method was selected ( ), and subject-based full-width half-maximum values were applied as default ( ). For statistical threshold, a cluster-level inference was used. In other words, a cluster of voxels was considered significantly activated across the studies if it survived a cluster-level   P   < 0.05, familywise error (FWE) rate-corrected for multiple comparisons, with a cluster-defining threshold of uncorrected voxel-level   P   < 0.001. This is the standard statistical threshold recommended for ALE meta-analysis ( ). A meta-analysis was performed independently for: (1) all 19 included studies, (2) 8 studies that involved food brand, (3) 9 studies that involved food nature, and (4) 5 studies that involved food nutrition. The thresholded ALE maps were overlaid onto the standard Colin T1 brain template in MNI space ( ) and visualized with Mango 4.0 ( ). The cluster size of brain regions was outputted by GingerALE from the ALE map.   shows a flow chat that illustrated the process of this ALE meta-analysis. \n  \nFlow chart that illustrates the process of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. \n  \n\n### Label-based meta-analysis \n  \nIn addition, a \u201clabel-based meta-analysis\u201d [method based on ( )] was performed to tabulate\/summarize the activated brain regions commonly reported across the studies. The extracted activation foci were re-surveyed by entering them into Mango 4.0, which provided a label to each focus (coordinate) to the nearest gray matter in a standardized way ( ). This qualitative analysis would provide additional information to the readers in case the quantitative ALE analysis yielded insignificant results. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe details of the 19 fMRI studies on food labels are listed in  . Each study recruited 9\u201350 subjects, with two studies recruiting men only and one study women only. Regarding subject handedness, 10 studies recruited right-handed subjects only, whereas 4 studies recruited mostly right-handed subjects and 5 studies did not report details. Regarding subject age, most of the studies recruited young and middle-aged adults, whereas 3 studies focused on children and adolescents below the age of 18, and no study involved the elderly above the age of 65. For body mass index (BMI) of the subjects, 8 studies provided the mean data that ranged from 17.7 to 23.6. Meanwhile, 7 studies reported the number of hours the subjects fasted prior to the fMRI scan (1\u20136 h) and 1 study reported that the subjects did not fast. For the dimensions investigated, 5 studies investigated food brand, 6 studies investigated food nature, 5 studies investigated food nutrition, and 3 studies investigated food brand\/nature. \n\nFor ALE meta-analysis, the overall analysis on all 19 studies, the analysis on food brand, and the analysis on food nature revealed no significant brain regions. Results remained insignificant even when a more liberal threshold of   P   < 0.05 (false-discovery rate corrected) with cluster size > 200 mm  was applied. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis on food nutrition revealed that the precuneus on the right hemisphere was significantly activated ( ). The peak voxel of the activated cluster was at [6, \u221268, 40], with ALE value of 1.75 \u00d7 10  and cluster size of 520 mm . \n  \nThe right precuneus was significantly activated across studies that investigated food nutrition labels. The peak voxel of the activated cluster was at [6, \u201368, 40], with ALE value of 1.75 \u00d7 10  and cluster size of 520 mm . \n  \nThe additional label-based meta-analysis showed that the activated brain regions for food brand processing seemed to be more diverse\/inconsistent compared to food nature and food nutrition ( \u2013 ).   shows the unthresholded ALE brain map for food brand.

Surprisingly, results did not yield significant activations in the hypothesized brain regions of the insula and the prefrontal cortex. Results have shown that the cerebral processing of food labels on nutrition significantly activated the right precuneus. The processing of food labels on food brand and food nature did not yield significant results. \n\nThe insula is known to be the primary taste cortex that processes neural signals relayed from taste receptors in the oral cavity ( ). The meta-analytic results here did not find significant activation of it, which might be partly explained by the fact that the analyzed studies did not involve actual tasting or stimulation of the taste receptors. Instead, the stimuli involved visual and cognitive aspects of food processing. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for top-down affective modulation ( ) and should be activated. The insignificant results might be attributed to heterogeneous designs of the studies. \n\nThe precuneus was reported to consume much more glucose than other parts of the cerebral cortex and thus sensitive to and easily affected by malnutrition ( ). Among healthy subjects, precuneus was found to activate more in response to personalized nutritional messages compared to untailored nutritional messages ( ). Meanwhile, its cortical thickness correlated with nutritional state and cognitive functions in patients with anorexia nervosa ( ). Hence, the results of current meta-analysis on food nutrition labels were consistent to the existing literature that the precuneus seems to play an important role in nutritional evaluation. \n\nAt first glance, the insignificant result from food brand was unexpected. However, a prior fMRI study that presented visual cues of car brands showed that the cerebral processing of brands indeed involved diverse brain regions, e.g., familiar brands preferentially activated superior frontal gyrus, hippocampus and posterior cingulate; sports and luxury brands activated medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus; whereas brands deemed value products activated superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate ( ). Therefore, the heterogeneity of subject background and the exact instructions given to them during fMRI scan might have attributed to the inconsistency across the analyzed studies. As a matter of fact, one of the analyzed studies on food brand did investigated Coca Cola and Pepsi separately, and compared brand-cued drink delivery to light-cued (colored circle) delivery ( ). Significant results were only found for Coca Cola but not Pepsi. Another study similarly found that Coca Cola elicited greater activation than Pepsi in the right amygdala, whereas the opposite comparison resulted in no significant activation ( ). This illustrated that the cerebral processing of food brand(s) could be complicated and not easily elicited in a consistent manner. \n\nThe heterogeneous situation was more obvious for food nature studies. Three studies investigated food versus non-food labels, followed by two investigated organic versus conventional food. Other comparisons were each investigated in one study, such as fair-trade label versus no label, food name label versus no label, eating alone label versus eating together label, and a correct match between flavor name and color on potato chip packaging versus a wrong match. It could be reasonably argued that different brain regions could be utilized for the cognitive processing of such distinct group of labels about food nature, rendering the results insignificant. There were even other labels on food nature being investigated. For instance, it was reported that there was a significant difference in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity level between viewing meat images labeled with Halal logo and those labeled with non-Halal logo, though this study was not included in the present analysis due to its lack of description on whether whole-brain analysis was performed (and also no brain coordinates provided) ( ). \n\nThis meta-analysis has several limitations. First, the participants involved in the analyzed studies were mainly young and middle-aged adults with some children and adolescents. The results therefore might not be well applied to the elderly population, especially that aging was shown to associate with decreasing activation in the precuneus in response to food stimuli in a previous study ( ). In addition, the analyses on the food brand and food nature subsets did not reveal significant results, so that potential follow-up analyses to compare between food brand, food nature, and food nutrition could not be conducted. Moreover, the majority of the analyzed studies exclusively recruited right-handed subjects or did not report subject handedness, similar to the scenario revealed by a prior survey on nutritional neuroscience literature ( ). It was established that handedness would affect the lateralization of cerebral processing of tasting ( ,  ). However, the methodology to gauge and determine subject handedness lacked a consensus and remained disputable ( ). Regardless, due to the lack of results from exclusively left-handed subjects, it was not possible to test and determine if handedness would affect cerebral processing of food labels. Readers should be aware of these limitations during results interpretation. Finally, ALE meta-analysis can only compute the consistency of brain coordinates activated across studies but it cannot compute the effect size ( ). Subsequently, future studies should include left-handed subjects in their sample. Moreover, the elderly people should be recruited so that the results could be more representative of the whole population. Researchers should share the statistical brain maps resulted from future original studies or report their effect size, so that the effect size could also be meta-analyzed. \n\nIn conclusion, the cerebral processing of food labels on nutrition significantly activated the right precuneus, a brain region related to nutritional evaluation. The peak voxel of the activated cluster was at [6, \u221268, 40], with ALE value of 1.75 \u00d7 10  and cluster size of 520mm . The processing of food labels on food brand and food nature did not yield significant results. More future studies are needed to better understand the cognitive processing of different kinds of food labels in our brain. They should include left-handed subjects as well as the elderly people, so that results could be more generalizable. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and has approved it for publication. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9808082,"text_md5":"1bbfcab82c56fdd3a480d04635895fdb","field_positions":{"authors":[0,19],"journal":[20,30],"publication_year":[32,36],"title":[47,134],"keywords":[148,208],"abstract":[221,1634],"body":[1643,20915]},"batch":2,"pmid":36606226,"doi":"10.3389\/fnut.2022.1056692","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9808082","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9808082"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9808082\">9808082<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9808082  Neural correlates of food labels on brand, nature, and nutrition: An fMRI meta-analysis"}

However, the results were not consistent in these changed brain areas in different studies. The present activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether cognitive function change was accompanied by the brain activation changes, and where the main areas most related to these changes were in schizophrenia patients after CRT. Analyses of whole-brain studies and whole-brain + region of interest (ROI) studies were compared to explore the effect of the different methodologies on the results. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nA computerized systematic search was conducted to collect fMRI and PET studies on brain activation changes in schizophrenia patients from pre- to post-CRT. Nine studies using fMRI techniques were included in the meta-analysis. Ginger ALE 2.3.1 was used to perform meta-analysis across these imaging studies. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nThe main areas with increased brain activation were in frontal and parietal lobe, including left medial frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule in patients after CRT, yet no decreased brain activation was found. Although similar increased activation brain areas were identified in ALE with or without ROI studies, analysis including ROI studies had a higher ALE value. \n\n\n## Conclusions: \n  \nThe current findings suggest that CRT might improve the cognition of schizophrenia patients by increasing activations of the frontal and parietal lobe. In addition, it might provide more evidence to confirm results by including ROI studies in ALE meta-analysis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## I \n  \nSchizophrenia is a serious psychiatric illness that about 1% of the population suffers from it.[ ] Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia, affects up to 80% of the patients,[ ] which were among the most treatment-resistant symptoms and associated with the poor social function.[ ] Though traditional pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia has positive effects on symptom reduction, especially positive symptom, the effects on neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments are limited with current medications.[ ] \n\nCognitive remediation is defined as a nonpharmaceutical and psychosocial treatment modality and a promising treatment with an ultimate goal of enhancing the cognitive function of schizophrenia.[ ] So far the most commonly reported deficits of schizophrenia are mainly associated with attention, working memory, learning ability, processing speed, and executive\/reasoning functions.[ ] Many studies have demonstrated that cognitive remediation is effective in improving the function of schizophrenia.[ ] \n\nRecently, the neuroimaging methods are widely adopted to evaluate the effect of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) and explore the neuromechanism of cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia. With the help of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), researchers indicated that cognitive training could improve participants\u2019 performance by increasing activation in the middle frontal gyrus, the superior and inferior parietal cortices.[ ] Studies evaluating brain activation changes from pre- to post-CRT can use either whole-brain or region of interest ([ROI], a priori hypothesized region or functionally defined regions from previous studies) study approach. Traditional opinions believe that only whole-brain studies should be included in activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis because including ROI studies might bias findings toward these hypothesized regions. However, a recent ALE study suggested that future studies might consider conducting and reporting both ROI and whole-brain voxel-wise analyses.[ ] \n\nSo far the changes of brain areas in schizophrenia after CRT reported in different studies are variable, and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that support cognitive improvement are largely unknown. Many researchers also have reported different increased activation regions in schizophrenia patients from pre- to post-CRT. fMRI studies found that compared with the control group, only schizophrenia patients had increased brain activation after CRT in regions associated with working memory, particularly in the inferior frontal gyrus.[ ] Randomized study found that compared with both patients and healthy controls, patients with CRT had increased activation in attention and working memory networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate, and the frontopolar cortex.[ ] Recently, studies found that following treatment, patients who received CRT exhibited increased ability to activate the prefrontal regions that could improve attention and working memory function.[ ] Besides, researchers found that following cognitive exercises, patients\u2019 verbal working memory performance improved and the task-related left inferior frontal cortex activation increased.[ ] In contrast to the increased brain activation, decreased brain activation areas were also found in some studies. Some researchers reported that compared with computer games, schizophrenia patients with cognitive plus social cognitive training showed decreased activation in medial superior frontal gyrus.[ ] A working memory training study found that short-term learning of stimulus material was associated with significant performance improvements and exponential signal decreases in a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network in both schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. Patients exhibited stronger signal decreases which were relative to controls in anterior cingulate, middle and superior temporal, superior frontal, and posterior parietal regions.[ ] \n\nALE is widely used in neuroimaging meta-analysis, but study selection criteria vary from whole-brain studies to both whole-brain and ROI studies, which might induce differences in the results. Recently, an ALE meta-analysis found increased activation in the lateral and medial PFC, parietal cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus.[ ] However, decreased activation and the effect of different study methods (ROI vs. whole-brain + ROI) were not mentioned in the study. In our study, ALE was used to conduct regions that changed brain activation from pre- to post-training. Both increased and decreased brain activation were systematically reviewed to conclude how the brain activation will change from pre- to post-CRT in patients with schizophrenia. At the same time, we compare the results of whole-brain studies with those of whole-brain + ROI studies to explore the effectiveness of different study methods. \n\n\n## M \n  \n### Literature search and selection \n  \nComputerized literature search was conducted through online scientific databases: PubMed\/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. The literature search was performed in March 2015, with no restrictions on the date of publication. Search terms included \u201ccogniti*,\u201d \u201crehabilitation,\u201d \u201cremediation,\u201d \u201ctraining,\u201d or \u201cenhancement,\u201d with different combinations of \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\u201d \u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cPET,\u201d and \u201cschizophrenia\u201d. Two persons selected studies independently according to the following inclusion criterion: (1) they were peer-reviewed research articles; (2) they were written in English; (3) samples of participants diagnosed with schizophrenia using research diagnostic criteria[ ] diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders III (DSM-III), DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, or ICD-10; (4) the data of regions that reported changed activation were available. The study by Wexler   et al  .[ ] was discarded as the data were not available, though we contacted the authors for the missing data; (5) studies assessing brain activation changes from pre- to post-CRT on patients with schizophrenia, respectively; (6) a pre- to post-improvement in at least one cognitive or social cognitive domain in patients after CRT; (7) brain activations were tested by MRI, fMRI, or PET. Six hundred and fifty-eight articles were identified through the literature search. Two authors used exactly the same include and exclude standards to retrieve the papers independently. Any disagreement was discussed to make sure that papers were chosen following those standards we made ahead of schedule. If we could not reach an agreement, we turn to an expert to confirm whether the study should be included or not. One article was added through hand searching. The papers that we retrieved were all peer-reviewed articles. Academic dissertation, conference paper, and review were all discarded. For the above criterion, the articles holding the most relevant information were provided in  .[ ] The procedure of selecting articles was listed in  . \n  \nSummary of the selected studies in the present meta-analysis \n      \nThe procedure of studies searching. CRT: Cognitive remediation therapy; fMRI: Functional magnetic resonance imaging; PET: Photon emission tomography; ALE: Activation likelihood estimation. \n  \nIn order to evaluate how methodological differences affect results, analysis of all studies reported coordinates in standard space and whole-brain studies only were conducted separately. Previous ALE meta-analysis found many commonalities between two analyses and suggested we not only include whole-brain, but also ROI studies.[ ] \n\nThe contrast of the selected studies included: (1) compared with non-CRT patients, CRT patients showed increased brain activation from pre- to post-training; (2) compared with non-CRT patients, CRT patients showed decreased brain activation from pre- to post-training. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis was conducted by applying the Ginger ALE software[ ] with the up-to-date revision Ginger ALE 2.3.1[ ] ( ). The analyses were conducted in Talairach space, the coordinates that originally reported in MNI[ ] space were converted to Talairach space using the Lancaster transform (\u201cicbm2tal\u201d).[ ] Then, they were listed as text files for each focus to be imported into Ginger ALE 2.3.1 and analyzed separately. \n\nALE is a coordinate-based method to identify concordance among results from different functional imaging studies. Coordinates were modeled with a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Coordinate-based meta-analysis is that the reported foci in the selected studies should be treated as spatial probability distributions around them.[ ] Ginger ALE provides random effects model instead of a fixed effects model. \n\nClusters identified in the meta-analysis were obtained after controlling the statistical significance with a false discovery rate[ ] at   P   < 0.05 and applying a minimum cluster size of 200 mm . This threshold has been used in former ALE analyses.[ ] Significant clusters were overlaid onto an anatomical Talairach template, colin_tlrc_1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.nii ( ), using the Mango software (version 3.2.7, 2014, Research Imaging Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, TX, USA;  ). \n\n\n\n## R \n  \n showed that nine studies with a total of 204 subjects (active = 84, patient control = 53, healthy control = 67) met the inclusion criteria for the ALE meta-analysis and 104 foci that reported changed brain activation in CRT patients from pre- to post-training. Six studies were whole-brain analyses while three studies used ROI approaches. Although these studies differed in cognitive training approaches and cognitive domains, they had the same purpose of improving schizophrenia patients\u2019 cognitive or social function. Only Vianinia's study reported CRT group had an increased brain activation from pre- to post-training; besides, compared with the non-CRT group, CRT group showed increased brain activation after treatment, excluding baseline differences. The other selected studies all reported Group \u00d7 Time interaction in brain activation changes. Among the selected studies, three of them reported decreased activation from pre- to post-training, compared with non-CRT patients. In order to confirm our results, meta-analysis was made with and without ROI studies separately. ALE analysis of foci that reported increased and decreased brain activation was conducted separately. \n\n### Areas increased activation from pre- to post-cognitive remediation therapy \n  \n All studies (whole-brain +ROI)  \n\nA total of 90 foci in seven studies (the two studies by Hooker   et al  . were conducted only once as they used the same participants) exhibited increased brain activation in schizophrenia patients after CRT.   presented the significantly increased brain regions. Eight significant clusters were found with increased brain activation from pre- to post-training, compared with non-CRT patients [  and  ], (1) the left inferior frontal gyrus (1120 mm , BA9); (2) the left medial frontal gyrus (512 mm , BA32); (3) the right middle frontal gyrus (464 mm , BA6); (4) the left precentral gyrus (416 mm , BA6); (5) the right postcentral gyrus (416 mm , BA2); (6) the left medial frontal gyrus (352 mm , BA6); (7) the right sub-gyral (296 mm , BA6); and (8) the left sub-gyral (216 mm , BA6). These increased brain regions were mainly located in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe. The final maps with significant regions of increased brain activation in patients with schizophrenia after cognitive remediation therapy among all the selected studies were displayed in  .[ ] \n  \nIncreased brain activation from all studies in CRT patients compared with non-CRT patients from pre- to post-training \n      \nRegions of increased brain activation in patients with pre- to post-training from all studies. Significance threshold with a false discovery rate corrected at   P   < 0.05. Peak coordinates (x, y, z) in Talairach space are presented. A: Anterior; P: Posterior; R: Right; L: Left; ALE: Activation likelihood estimation. \n  \n Whole-brain studies  \n\nIn order to evaluate the effects of whole-brain studies and whole-brain + ROI studies, a separate analysis of six whole-brain studies (40 subjects) was conducted. Five clusters were found with increased brain activation in CRT patients from pre- to post-training, compared with non-CRT patients [  and  ],[ ] (1) the right middle frontal gyrus (568 mm , BA6); (2) the right postcentral gyrus (552 mm , BA2); (3) the left medial frontal gyrus (440 mm , BA6); (4) the right inferior parietal lobule (280 mm , BA40); (5) the left middle frontal gyrus (208 mm , BA9). \n  \nIncreased brain activation from whole-brain studies only in CRT patients compared with non-CRT patients from pre- to post-training \n      \nRegions of increased brain activation in patients with pre- to post-training from whole-brain studies only. Significance threshold with a false discovery rate at   P   < 0.05. Peak coordinates (x, y, z) in Talairach space are presented. A: Anterior; P: Posterior; R: Right; L: Left; ALE: Activation likelihood estimation. \n  \nAccording to the results of two analyses, we found that most of the increased brain activation regions were the same, and the results from all studies indicated that more regions exhibit increased brain activation from pre- to post-training. These different regions conducted from the two results locate in the right inferior parietal lobule, left middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral sub-gyrus. \n\nFormer neuroimaging studies found a decreased activation in the middle frontal gyrus and medial superior frontal gyrus which participated in emotion perception from pre- to post-training.[ ] In addition, a study on practice information retrieval of working memory found patients showed significantly stronger activation decreases which were in anterior cingulate, middle and superior temporal, superior frontal, and posterior parietal regions. These regions were related to working memory processing and response preparation.[ ] No significant cluster was found either in analysis of all studies or in whole-brain studies only. \n\n\n\n## D \n  \nIn the present study, a voxel-wide and coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed to assess whether consistent brain activation changes were presented in nine fMRI studies. The main finding of the ALE meta-analysis was that patients with schizophrenia demonstrated an increase in activation from pre- to post-CRT and these regions were mainly in frontal and parietal lobe [ ]. It supports the idea that it is necessary to take into account the potential mechanisms of changes in brain activity in response to cognitive improvement. \n\n### Increased brain activation \n  \nConsistently increased brain activation in medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyrus, and sub-gyrus was found in schizophrenia patients from pre- to post-CRT, though the training approaches were different. These regions were mainly located in frontal and parietal lobe which were considered as a key region of cognitive function.[ ] Compared with healthy controls, these regions had shown hyper- or hypo-activation before training in patients.[ ] Increased brain activity in medial and middle frontal gyrus after CRT related to the improvement in working memory performance, increased activity in left inferior frontal might compensate schizophrenia patients in helping them catch up with healthy controls on cognitive tasks.[ ] Areas of pre- and post-central gyrus are related to emotion recognition, and the increased activity could be explained by facilitating emotion recognition through stimulation, a process in which people understand the feelings of others by generating those feelings in themselves.[ ] \n\nOverall, the increased activation demonstrated in our study provided preliminary evidence of training-induced neuroplasticity in schizophrenia patients. The findings substantiate prior data showed that increased activation was found in frontal regions (BA6\/9) after cognitive training and concluded that frontal regions were related to cognition of working memory. A former study in reality monitoring system found increased activity in medial PFC and postcentral gyrus in patients with schizophrenia and is consistent with the results presented in our study.[ ] Higher activation in right inferior frontal gyrus was also demonstrated and relative to the unsuccessful attempts of patients who inhibited preservative answers in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) learning test; besides, activation in right inferior gyrus was associated with inhibition.[ ] \n\nRecently, ALE meta-analysis comparing pre- and post-training brain activation has showed increased activity in the lateral and medial PFC, parietal cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus, though the training intensity and approaches were different.[ ] These were consistent with our findings that increased brain activation exhibited from pre- to post-CRT and were related to the improvement of cognition. \n\n\n### Decreased brain activation \n  \nAmong the selected studies, only three reported decreased activation from pre- to post-training. The regions with decreased activation were in anterior cingulate, middle and superior temporal, superior frontal, and posterior parietal; in addition, these regions might reflect learning related behavioral performance.[ ] Besides, deactivation in the central executive network and default mode network were reported in former studies which might reflect working memory and cognitive and emotion control.[ ] Some of the studies selected in the meta-analysis had not found decreased activation, observed but had not reported, or had not examined deactivation regions, therefore, when three studies that reported decreased activation after CRT were conducted by ALE, there was no significant region identified. Further studies should also examine decreased activation from pro- to post-CRT. Further by combining increased and decreased activation will help us to better understand how the brain activation will change after CRT. \n\n\n### Effect of different study methodologies \n  \nStudies measuring the brain activation changes often use an ROI (a prior hypothesized region or functionally defined regions from previous studies or meta-analysis) or whole-brain methods. Authors have different opinions on excluding ROI studies from ALE meta-analysis. Among the former ALE meta-analysis, some included all studies reporting coordinates in standard space,[ ] while some restricted analyses to only whole-brain studies.[ ] Instead of excluding ROI studies, our meta-analysis evaluated the impact of different methods on results. Therefore, analyses with or without ROI studies were conducted separately. Finally, eight clusters were found increased activation from all studies, while five clusters were found increased activation from whole-brain studies only [Tables   and  ]. Comparing the two results, there are many commonalities between them. The clusters identified without ROI analyses were subjected to those found in the meta-analysis of both whole-brain and ROI studies, so ROI analyses could overlook some regions and favor others which indicated that the ROI studies might not cause bias in the results. Meanwhile, analyses with ROI studies had a higher ALE value which could provide more evidence to confirm the conclusion. What is more, ALE analysis including both whole-brain and ROI studies was also conducted by Goghari to demonstrate relatives of schizophrenia patients with brain abnormalities in prefrontal cortical activation during executive processing,[ ] and concluded that ROI studies did not cause bias in the results. From the above findings, we suggest that ROI studies could be included in future ALE studies. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations in the present study. Firstly, the number of selected studies was restricted by current numbers of relevant publications. Only three studies reported decreased activation, and no significant clusters were found with decreased activation. Secondly, because of the limitation of the study method we could not put other factors (such as medication and the course of disease) as covariates into ALE analyses and could not assess the effect of these factors. Moreover, we could not create a funnel plot to evaluate the publication bias of the selected studies. Thirdly, the correlation between brain activation changes and cognitive improvement could not be made because of the study method. Further studies with larger samples and follow-up studies are needed. \n\n\n### Financial support and sponsorship \n  \nThis study was supported by the grants from the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 81372122, No. 31200844, No. 81171267 and No. 81361120403). \n\n\n### Conflicts of interest \n  \nThere are no conflicts of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4804440,"text_md5":"d90fa5a411efdf7570d122bd78a4f70f","field_positions":{"authors":[0,138],"journal":[139,156],"publication_year":[158,162],"title":[173,351],"keywords":[365,456],"abstract":[469,2368],"body":[2377,23375]},"batch":2,"pmid":26904993,"doi":"10.4103\/0366-6999.176983","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4804440","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4804440"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4804440\">4804440<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4804440  Correlation Between Brain Activation Changes and Cognitive Improvement Following Cognitive Remediation Therapy in Schizophrenia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-analysis"}

Introduction \n  \nSleep is an important physiological phenomenon of the human body, and normal sleep is an important guarantee for maintaining a healthy state of life and basic life activities. Sleep quality directly affects people's behavior, cognition, and even physical and mental health. With the acceleration of the pace of life and the increasing pressure from external factors such as society, environment, and working style, sleep deprivation (SD) has become the new normal of modern people, and the overall sleep duration has been on a long-term downward trend globally.  According to the sleep status survey of adult residents in 15 provinces of China in 2015, 9.8% of adults have the problem of sleep deficiency, , especially for a series of workers with occupational characteristics such as high load, shift work, and sleep disorders, the sleep ratio is seriously disordered.  Previous studies have shown that SD can cause individual abnormalities in emotion, learning, and memory,  such as mood change, memory decline, alertness, attention decline, executive decision-making ability decline, and so on, leading to accidents and diseases.  Therefore, how to reduce the negative impact of SD on the cognitive dysfunction of workers in all walks of life has become a key issue to be solved. \n\nThe pathogenesis of SD associated with cognitive disorders is not very clear at present, in modern medicine, awakening promoters, and receptor inhibitors are the main drugs to promote sleep and improve cognition.  Although these drugs can extend the patients\u2019 sleep time and improve cognition, they cannot solve the underlying problem of sleep deficiency and have great side effects in the long term. As the treasure of China, traditional Chinese acupuncture has a long history, safety, and effectiveness, and has been widely respected in clinical application. A large number of animal experiments and related clinical studies have confirmed the safety and effect of acupuncture in the treatment of SD with cognitive dysfunction,  but the specific mechanism remains to be further explored. \n\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a commonly used technique to study brain function. rs-fMRI uses magnetic resonance equipment to detect changes in blood oxygen levels during brain activity, so as to identify and locate brain functional areas and provide strong evidence for the study of complex brain activities.  It is one of the most commonly used technical means for brain function research at present. Studies using rs-fMRI have shown that SD is associated with arousal, emotion, reward, and abnormal functional activity in cognitive areas of the brain.  It is not only associated with abnormal functioning of local brain regions but also with abnormal internal connections of the default network, the prominence network, and the emotional network.  rs-fMRI has been used to study the mechanism of acupuncture in treating diseases.  Due to the different testing standards and sample sizes of testing equipment and analysis software, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, the meta-analysis method was used in this study to conduct an integrated analysis of the changes of low-frequency fluctuation amplitude (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (Re Ho) and to explore the characteristics and rules of the changes of brain activity in patients with cognitive dysfunction induced by SD with acupuncture, so as to provide effective evidence for clarifying the pathogenesis. \n\n\n## 2.

Selections of studies. \n  \nClinical studies will be identified and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers (QL and YW). In order to ensure that the reviewers have a good understanding of the background and purpose of the review, they will be trained in advance. Use Note Express 3.2.0 software ( ) to independently manage the search results from the above-mentioned databases. First, remove the duplicate literature. Afterward, after reviewing the title and abstract, exclude the literature that does not comply with the standard. Finally, further review the full text and rule out the literature that is not in line with the standard. Any disagreements related to study selection results will be discussed after cross-checking and arbitrated by the third reviewer (W.Y.). The flow diagram of all study selection procedures is shown in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of study and exclusion. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. \n  \n\n#### 2.3.2. Data extraction. \n  \nTwo reviewers (QL and YW) will independently select literature and extract data in accordance with the retrieval strategy. If there are differences of opinion, the third reviewer (X.G.) will participate in the discussion. According to the designed data extraction table, the basic information of the study includes: \n  \nIdentification information (article title, publication time, first author, and journal); \n  \nGeneral information (country, type of study, sample size, test design, and diagnosis standard); \n  \nParticipants (age, sex, and pretreatment fMRI results); \n  \nIntervention measures (acupuncture type, point selection, and treatment frequency\/course of treatment\/duration; administration time); \n  \nComparator (if any, details of treatment, including treatment method, frequency, and course of treatment); \n  \nResults (time, scale, and fMRI result points of each measurement, including Re Ho and ALFF, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Montreal cognitive assessment, psychomotor vigilance test, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, follow-up time, and adverse events). \n  \n\n\n### 2.4. Risk of bias assessment \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (S.M. and W.Y.) will assess the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The 2 reviewers will assess 7 items, which consist of the risk of bias of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants personnel and outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases. If there is disagreement during the assessing process, 2 reviewers will discuss or consult the third reviewer (X.G.) for a decision. Three evaluation grades are low, unclear, and high risk of bias. \n\n\n### 2.5. Measures of treatment effect \n  \nMean differences with 95% confidence intervals will present as continuous data. Also, the risk ratio will be the expression of dichotomous data. \n\n\n### 2.6. Dealing with missing data \n  \nWe will e-mail the corresponding author to obtain the necessary information, which is missing or insufficient. Otherwise, we will analyze the existing information and conduct a sensitivity analysis to address the potential impact of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.7. Assessment of heterogeneity \n  \n I   will be used for assessing statistical heterogeneity. It is acknowledged that   I  \u2005<\u200525% indicates negligible heterogeneity, 25%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200550% indicates mild heterogeneity, 50%\u2005<\u2005  I  \u2005<\u200575% moderate heterogeneity, and   I  \u2005\u2265\u200575% high heterogeneity. \n\n\n### 2.8. Assessment of reporting bias \n  \nOver 10 studies included, we will take advantage of funnel plot to assess the reporting bias. Symmetrical funnel indicates no publishing bias, but if the funnel is not symmetrical, which indicates publishing bias exists.   P   value will be utilized, while <10 studies included. \n\n\n### 2.9. Data syntheses \n  \nWe will take advantage of Rev Man software (version 5.4) for Statistical analyses performing. Only if there is no or mild significant heterogeneity (  I  ), we will apply the fixed-effect model, or the random-effects model will be selected. \n\n\n### 2.10. Analysis of subgroups or subsets \n  \nSubgroup analysis will be conducted to evaluate the specific influence of intervention type, acupoints selection, and treatment duration on pooled results. If the data is insufficient, qualitative synthesis will be conducted instead of quantitative synthesis. \n\n\n### 2.11. Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe robustness of the results will be assessed by sensitivity analysis performance which will focus on the processing method of missing data. \n\n\n### 2.12. Grading the quality of evidence \n  \nAccording to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method, 2 reviewers (W.Y. and X.G.) will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation rating standards to independently assess the quality of evidence for each outcome as 4 levels: \u201cvery low,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d quality. The quality of evidence will be assessed according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. \n\n\n### 2.13. Ethics and dissemination \n  \nDue to nothing of the information will be obtained from an individual participant, the systematic review does not need ethical approval or patient consent. The results of this meta-analysis will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \nCurrently, it is believed that the neurobiological mechanism of post-SD cognitive impairment is mainly through changing the metabolism of brain substances to structural and functional damage neurons in different brain regions, and thus impair cognitive function.  Studies on the mechanism of SD influence on cognitive function based on fMRI technology mainly focus on the brain functional connection and its connection with cognitive function and other neurobehavioral studies. For example, in the study on the effect of SD on alertness and attention function based on fMRI technology, it was found that SD had a negative effect on the attention function network, and the mechanism might be that SD weakened the functional connection between the dorsal attention network system of the brain and other brain regions.  In terms of learning and memory, someone  studied short-term memory disorders with the hippocampus as the seed point and found that SD reduced the functional connections between the hippocampus and superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and auxiliary motor area, indicating that the abnormal functional connections between hippocampus and cortex after SD were related to the reduction of short-term memory. In addition, studies have shown that  SD could lead to the dysfunction of the functional connectivity of the hippocampus, thus affecting the process of memory consolidation and damaging long-term memory. In terms of executive decision-making ability, it is reported  that the accuracy of recognizing neutral and positive words in the SD population decreased, and the activation of the dorsolateral frontal cortex was enhanced when recognizing positive words, while the activation of the insula was enhanced when recognizing emotional words, indicating that SD can affect the judgment, decision making, and executive ability, and is closely related to the dorsolateral frontal cortex and insula in the brain. In conclusion, rs-fMRI is an important brain imaging technique for the study of cognitive dysfunction in SD patients. \n\nThe application of acupuncture can improve sleep quality, reduce the occurrence of adverse events related to sleep disorders, and alleviate the negative effects of SD on cognitive function, which is safe and effective. Previous studies have reported that acupuncture San Yin Jiao Point (SP6)  can improve the activity intensity of the default network, precuneus anterior lobe, cingulate gyrus, and other brain regions, and strengthen the interaction between the frontal lobe and temporal lobe, and the connection of synchronous neural network, indicating that acupuncture of SP6 has a strong ability of integration and regulation of mental intelligence, emotion regulation, and brain cognitive dysfunction. \n\nIn recent years, relevant researches on exploring the mechanism of acupuncture for SD comorbid with cognitive decline on rs-fMRI have been reported, but there has been no systematic review and meta-analysis. This study will integrate all the latest relevant literature in this field to explore the effects of acupuncture on the brain activity of patients with SD and cognitive dysfunction. However, due to the lack of relevant clinical research literature, correlation analysis such as subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis may not be possible. In addition, heterogeneity may exist between studies due to the use of different evaluation criteria and intervention methods. In conclusion, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide an evidence-based medical basis for clarifying the central nervous system mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of SD comorbid with cognitive dysfunction. \n\n\n## Acknowledgment \n  \nWe appreciate the financial support received from the Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (No. YDZJ202101ZYTS103) \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Data curation:   Ying Wang, Qi Lu. \n\n Formal analysis:   Weiwan Yang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Investigation:   Xiaole Guo, Weiwan Yang. \n\n Supervision:   Hongfeng Wang. \n\n Validation:   Ying Wang, Shiqi Ma. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Xiaole Guo. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Xiaole Guo, Hongfeng Wang. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10082247,"text_md5":"51bc402335a89ddc8af3222ecc00d3a5","field_positions":{"authors":[0,87],"journal":[88,108],"publication_year":[110,114],"title":[125,278],"keywords":[292,375],"abstract":[388,1873],"body":[1882,19213]},"batch":2,"pmid":37026925,"doi":"10.1097\/MD.0000000000033490","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10082247","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10082247"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10082247\">10082247<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10082247  Study on acupuncture improving sleep deprivation comorbid with cognitive dysfunction based on rs-fMRI: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Peak areas of high concordance for activations during vestibular stimulation but deactivations during fear conditioning were centered on the posterior insula and S2. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe structural overlap of both networks allows the following functional interpretations: first, the amygdala, superior colliculi, and antero-medial thalamus might represent a release of preprogramed sensorimotor patterns of approach or avoidance. Second, the activation (vestibular system) and deactivation (fear system) of the bilateral posterior insula is compatible with the view that downregulation of the fear network by acute vestibular disorders or unfamiliar vestibular stimulation makes unpleasant perceived body accelerations less distressing. This also fits the clinical observation that patients with bilateral vestibular loss suffer from less vertigo-related anxiety. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s00415-023-11568-7. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere is increasing evidence, based on animal models and studies in humans, that the vestibular system is connected via multiple pathways with the functional structures relevant for fears and anxiety and cognitive and emotional effects [ \u2013 ]. These pathways between regions relevant for vestibular function and those relevant for fears and anxiety are particularly related to thalamocortical and cerebellar networks. The functional regulation is based on intrinsic neurotransmitters of the inner ear, thalamocortical and limbic connections. For instance, corticotropin-releasing factor mediates stress, fear and anxiety-related (loco)motor behaviors via the lateral vestibular nucleus [ ]. This demonstrates the functional link between the anxiety and vestibular system since the vestibular nuclei are an integrative part of the balance system. Altogether there are close functional connections between stress, fear, anxiety, and balance, even at the level of the pontomedullary vestibular nuclei of the caudal brainstem. \n\nClinically, this is evident in patients with vestibular disorders showing a high comorbidity with anxiety, somatoform and depressive disorders such as in Meni\u00e8re\u2019s disease (38\u201348%), vestibular migraine (49%) and vestibular paroxysmia (51%) [ ,  \u2013 ]. The extent of the fear and anxiety associated with vertigo and dizziness correlated with the extent of vestibular excitation or inhibition related to the vestibular disorder [ ]. A recent survey on a total of 7083 patients with the key symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, and balance disorders confirmed that vestibular disorders characterized by an excitation or a tone imbalance of bilateral vestibular function were associated with increased anxiety related to vertigo and dizziness [ ]. In contrast, patients with unilateral or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), i.e., with a loss of peripheral vestibular input, exhibited lower rates of associated anxiety about falling [ ] or susceptibility to fear of heights despite postural instability [ ]. The above described interrelations raised the question whether an intact vestibular function is required to develop vertigo-related anxiety [ ,  ]. \n\nThe vestibular and fear\/anxiety networks can be artificially stimulated in healthy volunteers to allow their examination in an experimental brain imaging setting. For vestibular stimulation, caloric, galvanic or sound-induced otolith stimulation are used inside the scanner. The central vestibular network in humans identified by earlier brain imaging studies runs from the vestibular brainstem nuclei via the posterolateral and centromedial thalamus to parietotemporal cortex areas (meta-analyses: [ ,  ]). Its multisensory core region representing the human homologue of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in monkeys (PIVC) [ ] is localized in the posterior insular gyri, the retroinsular area Ri, and the posterior parietal operculum [ ,  ,  ]. Imaging of the anxiety network revealed a similarly extended distribution from brainstem to cortex with an overlap of the neuronal circuits of fear [ ], which justified a commonly used model to investigate fear and anxiety by classical fear conditioning. Whereas anxiety is a non-stimulus directed general feeling, fear can be attributed to a certain aversive stimulus and is used in fear conditioning experiments. Thereby a stimulus (CS+), after being effectively paired with an aversive and therefore threatening stimulus, is compared against a comparable unpaired stimulus (CS\u2212) (for methodological issues see [ ]). In previous meta-analyses\/reviews on fear conditioning fMRI studies, an extended fear network was described [ \u2013 ]. Using an image and coordinate-based meta-analytical approach (effect-size signed differential mapping), Fullana et al. [ ] reported multiple clusters of activation, which can be assigned to the following functional subsystems relevant for the unique experience of fear and anxiety (see also [ ,  ]): areas processing emotional arousal (thalamus, brainstem, hypothalamus) and attention (cingulate cortex, precuneus), areas associated with emotional anticipation and internal state regulation (anterior insula), emotional meaning and valence (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum), and areas involved in motor reaction (premotor cortex, supplementary motor area) and conditioned learning (lateral cerebellar hemisphere). \n\nA close interconnection between the neural circuits of vestibular and anxiety systems has been postulated before [ ,  ], but not formally investigated yet. Possible anatomical links include networks from the brainstem (especially the parabrachial nucleus) [ ,  ], cerebellum [ ,  ], hypothalamus [ ], thalamus [ ], and amygdala up to the vestibular cortex [ ] and other cortical areas subserving sensorimotor functions and emotional, cognitive, and visceral responses. \n\nIn the current study, we aimed to statistically overlap the neural substrates processing fear conditioning and vestibular stimulation, thereby confirming theoretical considerations derived from patient and animal studies. In a first step, we applied seed-based d-Mapping (SDM) on functional mapping studies in healthy volunteers investigating vestibular stimulation. The same SDM approach had been adopted for calculating meta-analytic data on fMRI studies applying fear conditioning that were provided by Fullana et al. [ ]. Including actual statistical voxel-wise brain maps, SDM showed better results than previous coordinate-based meta-analyses with respect to overlap and sensitivity [ ]. In a second step, we combined the two meta-analyses on functional imaging studies applying fear conditioning or vestibular stimulation and calculated peak areas of high convergence. In accordance with previous fMRI studies and meta-analyses (see above, [ ,  ,  ]), convergence was expected in the anterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), the prefrontal and parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, secondary motor areas, amygdala, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection: vestibular stimulation \n  \nA comprehensive literature search using PubMed was conducted for peer-reviewed fMRI studies on vestibular stimulation until September 3rd, 2021. The search terms were \u201cvestibular cortex\u201d OR \u201cvestibular stimulation\u201d OR \u201ccaloric stimulation\u201d OR \u201cgalvanic stimulation\u201d AND human AND fMRI\u201d. Additionally, we checked the reference sections of published articles, particularly the two existing activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses [ ,  ] identifying another six publications. Altogether, 173 studies were identified. We focused on studies investigating healthy participants with galvanic or caloric vestibular stimulation, and conducted functional imaging of the whole brain as well as a 2nd level random-effects analysis. In the literature search, we did not include studies conducted with positron emission tomography, because of its generally lower spatial resolution. Sound-evoked vestibular stimulation studies (a combination of acoustic and otolith stimulation via the sacculus, see [ ,  ] were excluded here for the following reasons: this kind of stimulation has to be a suprathreshold auditory one, which elicits an unnatural and incomplete stimulation of one type of vestibular receptors (sacculus). An evaluation as to vestibular excitation requires subtraction of the auditory effects. The remaining activation of the vestibular network is minimal and locally restricted according to the limited contribution of the sacculus input to a gross vestibular input. Furthermore, some of the more recent studies have methodological shortcomings, in particular a subthreshold auditory stimulation, which makes a concurrent vestibular stimulation questionable. Detailed reasons for exclusion of studies are provided in Fig.\u00a0  and its legend.   \nPRISMA diagram of study selection process. Studies were excluded, if they were reviews or meta-analyses (  n  \u2009=\u200917), if there was no brain imaging (  n  \u2009=\u20097), or brain imaging conducted with positron emission tomography (see above,   n  \u2009=\u20097), near infrared spectroscopy (  n  \u2009=\u20091), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  n  \u2009=\u20091), diffusion tractography imaging (  n  \u2009=\u20096), if the study did not investigate the whole brain (  n  \u2009=\u20092), if the study investigated only patients\/single cases (  n  \u2009=\u200941) or special groups (astronauts   n  \u2009=\u20091), if there was no galvanic or caloric stimulation (  n  \u2009=\u200937) or a concurrent task or visual stimulation (  n  \u2009=\u200912), if there was no random-effects analysis (  n  \u2009=\u20098), or those which investigated only resting state functional connectivity (  n  \u2009=\u200910), brain structure (  n  \u2009=\u20092), or magnetic stimulation inside the scanner (  n  \u2009=\u20098). One article was excluded because it was written in Chinese. If the study measured, but did not report results of the whole brain in common stereotactic space (  n  \u2009=\u20094), authors were contacted for further information. Of those, two were able to provide further data, the other two were discarded \n  \n\nFinally, we were able to collect imaging results from 10 independent fMRI studies using vestibular stimulation with 187 healthy adult participants (75 males, 74 females, and 38 of unclear sex, mean age 32.7\u00a0years) (Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). All but one study reported the contrast vestibular stimulation versus baseline\/rest condition. All corresponding authors were contacted and asked for the original group-level statistical t-maps, which were obtained for eight studies. For the remaining two studies, peak coordinates were extracted and coded from the original publication or from supplementary data provided by corresponding authors. Eight of ten selected studies were based on galvanic vestibular stimulation, which induced a gentle perception of body sway without distressing adverse effects. The caloric vestibular stimulation as used for clinical routine is only mildly aversive in some individuals. Subjects with unpleasant side effects were, as a rule, not included in experimental studies.   \nCharacteristics of 10 fMRI studies with stimulation of the vestibular system included in the meta-analysis \n  \nAll participants were healthy \n\n GVS   galvanic vestibular stimulation,   CAL   caloric stimulation,   AC   alternating current,   DC   direct current,   SPM   statistical parametric mapping,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute,   TAL   Talairach \n  \n\n\n### Literature search and study selection\u2014fear conditioning \n  \nLiterature search and study selection were carried out as described in detail by Fullana et al. [ ]. After excluding ineligible studies, 27 studies with 677 participants (366 males, mean age 25.4\u00a0years) using a delay differential cue-conditioning paradigm were obtained. All studies reported a CS\u2009+\u2009\u2009>\u2009CS\u2212, 19 of them also the opposite contrast. For 13 of them, original empirical 3D statistical images were available [ ]. The entire data of fear conditioning have been published before in [ ]. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic procedure \n  \nFunctional activation differences between the stimulation of the vestibular system and the control (rest) condition were analyzed using \u201cSeed-based d-Mapping-Permutation of Subject Images (Sdm-Psi)\u201d, version 6.21 ( ) [ ]. In contrast to previous coordinate-based meta-analyses testing convergence of the reported peaks [ ], this method assigned effect sizes to each voxel. When original 3D statistical images were available, it converted t-values to effect sizes [ ]. If only peak information was available, effect sizes were imputed multiple times based on the known data (e.g., effect size of the peaks) and the spatial covariance between adjacent voxels [ ]. These study images were then voxel-wise combined into random-effects meta-analysis images. To assess the statistical significance using FWE correction, SDM-PSI imputed and permuted subject images saving maximum threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) statistic of the combined meta-analysis image from each permutation [ ]. \n\nWe used the Sdm-Psi pipeline with default parameter settings. After preprocessing, the calculated peak of one original dataset differed from the reported peak in the respective paper, so that instead of the statistical image, the reported peak information was included to the analysis. Our analysis thus comprised seven original statistical images [ ,  \u2013 ] and three studies with peak information [ \u2013 ]. Meta-analytic means were calculated using 50 imputations, followed by FWE correction with 1000 permutation. TFCE-corrected maps were thresholded with   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. MNI coordinates of the outcome files were checked and specified with the \u201cAnatomy\u201d toolbox (vs. 2.2b, [ ]) of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12). The   I   index and Egger\u2019s method were used to assess for heterogeneity of effect sizes and publication bias (robustness analyses, see Supplementary Table 1). \n\n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nTo assess the brain regions of common activations of vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning, we conservatively selected the voxels that showed statistical significance in both the vestibular and the fear conditioning meta-analysis, while we discarded voxels that showed statistical significance in only one of the meta-analyses. The statistical significance was not derived from the   z   value, but rather from the meta-analyses\u2019 statistical significance (e.g., derived from the TFCE-based permutation test). \n\nTo create the map of   z   values, we conservatively assigned each voxel the lowest   z   value between both meta-analyses (i.e., that closer to zero). For instance, if in a given voxel, the   z   value was 3.2 in the vestibular meta-analysis and 3.7 in the fear conditioning meta-analysis, we would use 3.2 for the conjunction analysis. We thus provide a map of the minimum effects across meta-analyses: for each voxel, the   z   value in the different meta-analyses is at least as high as the   z   value of this map. \n\nVisualization of activation maps was performed using MRICroGL (64bit OSX; Version 2016). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural correlates of vestibular stimulation \n  \nThe brain regions demonstrating significant peak areas of high concordance during activation of the vestibular network showed the bilateral insula and adjacent structures, right Heschl\u2019s gyrus (A1), the right temporal pole, putamen, thalamus, right amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), cingulate cortex (CC), supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), M1, S1, S2, supramarginal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), superior parietal lobule (SPL), cerebellum (vermis, dentate nuclei, hemispheres), and ponto-mesencephalic brainstem with inferior and superior colliculi (Fig.\u00a0 A, Supplementary Table 1) (for medial structures and brainstem see Fig.\u00a0 B).   \nPeak areas of high concordance during vestibular activation overlaid on T1-MNI reference brains in yellow\u2013red (color coded   z   values on the bottom). Axial\/transversal slice position is plotted as   z  -coordinates for the MNI-system.   A   Axial slices with representations comprising the bilateral insula and adjacent structures (right temporal pole, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\/VLPFC, putamen), thalamus, right amygdala, right Heschl\u2019s gyrus (primary auditory cortex\/A1), frontal lobe (dorsolateral PFC, left orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex\/CC, supplementary motor area\/SMA, premotor cortex\/PMC, primary motor cortex\/M1), parietal areas (primary and secondary somatosensory cortex\/S1 and S2, supramarginal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobe\/IPL and SPL), cerebellar dentate nuclei, hemispheres and vermis, and ponto-mesencephalic brainstem with superior and inferior colliculi.   B   Cluster of high concordance around the brainstem showed activation in thalamus, PAG, nucleus ruber, dorsal midbrain including superior colliculi, vermis, and posterior cerebellar hemispheres. Slices have been positioned in x = \u221230; \u221220, \u221215, \u221210, \u22125, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 \n  \n\nPeak areas of high concordance of deactivation under vestibular stimulation was evident in a cluster (1375 voxels) in the bilateral middle orbital gyrus (MNI: 4, 42, \u2212 4; SDM-Z\u2009=\u20094.55,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001; MNI: \u2212 6, 50, \u2212 4; SDM-Z\u2009=\u2009\u2212 3.5,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004) and left anterior cingulate cortex (MNI: \u2212 6, 40, 2; SDM-Z\u2009=\u2009\u2212 3.93,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). A complete table showing all significant coordinates is added to the Supplemental Material (Supplementary Table 1). \n\nOur additional analyses indicated that there was low heterogeneity (mean   I  \u2009=\u200918.1%, sd\u2009=\u200918.7, range 0.02\u201357%) and no evidence of potential publication bias (Egger\u2019s test: 6 out of 44 significant with   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) in the main results (Supplementary Table 1). \n\n\n### Regions of high concordance across vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning \n  \nRegions that showed high concordance during vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning included the bilateral anterior insula in a common cluster with the VLPFC and the temporal pole, the DLPFC, cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, Heschl\u2019s gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyrus, S2, IPL, and subcortical structures such as the antero-medial thalamus, anterior thalamic projections, bilateral putamen, mesencephalic brainstem, cerebellar vermis and posterior hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 ). Supplementary Table 2 provides a more detailed description of peak coordinates and areas.   \nBrain regions showing significant high concordance for vestibular stimulation (analysis presented here) and fear conditioning (meta-analysis published in [ ]). Color bar provides   z   value coding. Z-position plotted above each axial\/transversal slice.   A   For axial slice overlay of the conjunction analysis between the two conditions activations were significant for the anterior insula, frontal lobe areas (dorso- and ventrolateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex\/medial cingulate cortex, the supplementary motor area\/SMA and the premotor cortex\/PMC), subcortical structures (antero-medial thalamus, anterior thalamic projections, striate, mesencephalic brainstem, cerebellar vermis and parts of the posterior hemispheres), temporal areas (Heschl gyrus; superior and middle temporal gyrus), and parietal areas (S2, IPL).   B   The cluster of concordance around the brainstem showed activation in the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, nucleus ruber, dorsal midbrain, vermis, and posterior cerebellar hemispheres. Overall, all areas of high concordance detected for vestibular activation in the brainstem, thalamus and cerebellum were also active during fear conditioning \n  \n\nThe calculation of areas of concordance for activation during vestibular stimulation and deactivation for fear conditioning revealed significant results in the right postcentral gyrus (MNI: 66, \u2212 10, 22, SDM-Z\u2009=\u20093.23, 322 voxels), the bilateral posterior insula (anterior part of the long insular gyrus; MNI: 38, \u2212 10, 16, SDM-Z\u2009=\u20092.58, 259 voxels; MNI \u2212 34, \u2212 10, 16, SDM-Z\u2009=\u20092.34, 235 voxels), the bilateral S2 (OP1 and OP3), and the left superior temporal gyrus (MNI: \u2212 56, \u2212 12, \u2212 2, SDM-Z\u2009=\u20091.93, 73 voxels) (Fig.\u00a0 ). Note that the statistical significance for the conjunction analysis was not derived from the   z   values, but rather from the two meta-analyses\u2019 statistical significance.   \nRegions of concordance for activation during vestibular stimulation and deactivation during fear conditioning: right postcentral gyrus, bilateral insula (predominantly anterior long insular gyrus, i.e., first long insular gyrus according to [ ], secondary somatosensory cortex\/S2 (predominantly OP1 and OP3), and left superior temporal gyrus (color bar provides   z   value coding). Axial\/transversal slice position is plotted as   z  -coordinates for the MNI-system \n  \n\nThe reverse contrast of activation for fear conditioning and deactivation during vestibular stimulation did not yield any significant result. The calculation of areas of concordance for deactivation under vestibular stimulation and deactivation for fear conditioning showed a small region in the left superior frontal gyrus (MNI: 0, 54, 12; SDM-Z\u2009=\u20091.92, 45 voxels). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nApplying a voxel-based meta-analysis across 10 functional imaging studies during vestibular stimulation, we identified a distributed network comprising the bilateral insula and adjacent structures, Heschl\u2019s gyrus and superior temporal lobe, anterior and medial thalamus, right superior amygdala, frontal lobe structures (VLPFC, DLPFC, AVCC, MCC, SMA, PMC), superior and inferior parietal lobe and the intraparietal sulcus, mesencephalic brainstem and cerebellum (vermis and anterior hemisphere). This is in agreement with several earlier human imaging studies conducted by various groups [ ,  ,  ]. With regard to our main question about a functional overlap of brain areas, which show an overlap during processing of vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning, we found convergence in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, secondary motor areas, the anterior-medial insula, superior temporal lobe including auditory processing areas, and subcortical areas such as the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the mesencephalic brainstem, cerebellar vermis and posterior cerebellar hemispheres. Further, we identified opposite effects of both kinds of stimulation: peak areas of high concordance for activations during vestibular stimulation but deactivations during fear conditioning were centered on the posterior insula and S2. \n\nIn the following the most relevant areas of a network overlap will be discussed with respect to their possible functional implications. Three main findings regard the insula: (A) the entire insula in both hemispheres was mapped demonstrating significant activation during vestibular stimulation, (B) the conjunction of vestibular and fear conditioning stimulation revealed an overlap of activation in the anterior insula bilaterally, (C) the posterior insula showed concordance of increased activation during vestibular stimulation but decreased activation during fear conditioning. Overall, the insula is called the hub of the salience network integrating incoming stimuli of all modalities with the internal state of the body and mind (i.e., interoception) [ ,  ]. The multisensory posterior insula\u2014highly interconnected with the thalamus, other vestibular as well as primary and secondary somatosensory cortex [ ]\u2014is involved in the discrimination of body motion and provides topographic and modality-specific interoceptive signals to the anterior insular cortex. It also comprises the core region of the vestibular cortical network (e.g., PET imaging: [ ]; structural connectivity: [ ]; stroke lesion and balance impairments: [ ]). In a posterior to anterior progression, an integration of these visceral and somatosensory information takes place going along with interoceptive awareness and subjectivity [ ,  ]. The anterior ventral insula represents a socioemotional region [ ] connected to the orbitofrontal cortex as well as the ACC [ ] with descending influences on the amygdala and autonomic nervous system, which mediate fear and anxiety systems [ ,  ]. Notably, especially the discriminative posterior insula activated during vestibular processing is downregulated during fear conditioning, which may make unfamiliar distressing body accelerations or acute vestibular disorders less threatening. This underlines and extends hypotheses raised before on the basis of patient investigations with a decrease of vertigo-related anxiety in bilateral or unilateral peripheral vestibular loss [ ,  ]. This interpretation is based on the application of a fundamental concept discovered as a reciprocal inhibitory interaction between sensory systems: experimental activations of the vestibular cortical network were associated with concurrent deactivations of the visual and somatosensory cortex areas [ \u2013 , for review:  ]. Originally this pattern of reciprocal activations and deactivations were found during visually induced self-motion perception, for example, activations of occipital and parietal visual areas were associated with deactivations of the multisensory vestibular cortex [ ,  ]. The functional interpretation was that during motion perception, the dominant sensorial weight may be shifted from one modality to the other, thereby resolving conflicts of a sensory mismatch. Later, such interactions were found for other sensory modalities, e.g., the somatosensory and nociceptive, the nociceptive and the vestibular, the tactile sensory and visual, and the visual and auditory systems [ ,  \u2013 ]. Although in the current study, we did not effectively investigate an interaction between the vestibular and fear systems, the activation\u2013deactivation of the posterior insula based on two meta-analyses might support the interpretation presented above. It might further extend another functional implication described before on the basis of patient investigations that showed a decrease of vertigo-related anxiety in bilateral or unilateral peripheral vestibular loss [ ,  ]. \n\nConvergent activation in S2 (OP1) indicated an important role in both hemispheres not only for vestibular processing [ ,  ,  ], but also for fear conditioning [ ]. When contrasting activation during vestibular stimulation with deactivation during fear conditioning, predominately OP1 and OP3 were activated. These areas are adjacent to the dorsal posterior insula and close to area Ri, which showed high fMRI response to vestibular stimulation in an earlier meta-analysis by [ ]. This confirms studies in which several neighboring areas in the insular-opercular cortex were reported to process cortical vestibular input such as Ri, Ig, OP1, 2, 3, and 4 [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe role of the amygdala during fear conditioning has been the subject of much discussion. Since amygdala activation is stronger during the first part of fear conditioning experiments [ ], and also only present for a very short time following an aversively rated stimulus [ ], it had often not been identified in fear conditioning studies [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Nowadays, the role of the amygdala is discussed as a \u201csignificance indicator\u201d rather than a specific indicator for fearful stimuli [ ]. Our current study identified convergence of amygdala activation during vestibular processing, which might well fit into the notion that vestibular input is involved in avoidance behavior (see also Discussion on cingulate cortex and collicular complex). \n\nHigh convergence was also evident in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex for both vestibular and fear conditioning, compatible with the major involvement of this region in emotion by connections of the anterior part to the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, its tight interconnection with the anterior insula [ ], but also interactions with higher cortical areas processing spatial orientation (posterior part of the parietal cortex [ ]) and memory (hippocampal system). The motor output of the midcingulate cortex is interconnecting secondary motor areas (for review see: [ ,  ]). After the amygdala indicated high relevance of a stimulus, the cingulate cortex is associated with increasing attention and, for its superior more dorsal areas, the initiation of behavioral consequences (retreat). Therefore, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex has been described to be essential in processing the \u201ctipping point\u201d between approach and avoidance behavior, relating to the probability of an aversive outcome [ ]. Resulting motor behavior is then organized in a more profound motor program processed in the SMA and the dPMC. Both types of stimuli were relevantly activating the medial cingulate cortex, the SMA and the dPMC as secondary motor areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal lobe contributes to increased higher cognitive functioning when planning processes following aversive stimulation but also the cognitive control of emotional retreat in an experimental condition (for a discussion see also [ ]). \n\nWith regard to the overlap between vestibular and fear processing, we also found convergence in the antero-medial thalamus, anterior thalamic projections, and the striatum (especially left ventral putamen). These thalamic areas are interconnected with areas of the prefrontal and the temporal lobe, which showed also significant convergent activation. Both fear and vestibular stimulation provide relevant behavioral input resulting in an increased arousal, which is processed in the thalamus [ ]. In short, with respect to function one could assume that the posterolateral thalamic vestibular projections constitute the primary input, whereas the anterior thalamic projections are involved in more complex behavioral processing including emotions and anxiety. \n\nConvergence for vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning was detected in the cerebellar vermis and posterior cerebellar hemisphere (Larsell\u2019s VI), but not in sensorimotor areas of the anterior cerebellar hemisphere (Larsell HV). Posterior superior cerebellar activation has been shown to be involved in fear conditioning [ ], and also occurred during vestibular stimulation in the current meta-analysis. \n\nThe current meta-analysis of vestibular stimulation studies exhibited convergent bilateral activation of the inferior colliculi (IC) and the superior colliculi, functionally most relevant structures for eye-, head- and body orientation and motor behavior in space and largely dependent on life-threatening emotional processes. The IC is a center for integration and analysis of various auditory features with ascending and descending pathways in the brainstem transmitting auditory information to the ipsilateral thalamus and cerebral cortex [ ]. For 3D-sound localisation, the vestibular system may provide the three-dimensional spatial frame of the current head position in space. Animal studies have shown vestibular input to the IC [ \u2013 ]. Thus, the IC is a multisensory hub with major auditory, but also vestibular input as found in the current study. \n\nThe superior colliculus is a multisensory nucleus with the major input from the retina as well as auditory and somatosensory receptors to mediate the orientation of the head and senses toward targets of interest to analyze (sensory input) and control (motor output) gaze as well as ears, head, and body in space. This synkinesis of coordinated orientation movements is critical for survival. In a threatening situation, the superior colliculus elicits a reflex-like orientation and defense response in animals (for review see: [ \u2013 ]). After recognition of a threatening event the decision to either fight or fly is likely to depend on a thalamo-cortical arousal, which releases an appropriate preprogramed sensorimotor pattern. In humans, it is similarly critical, e.g., for avoidance of imminent collisions during driving or in sports, shown by Billington and co-workers [ ] in an fMRI investigation in which the SC and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus were activated. Although not yet described, interconnection with vestibular input is imperative and has been shown in the current meta-analysis on vestibular stimulation (Fig.\u00a0 ). Accordingly, the current overlap with fear conditioning (Fig.\u00a0 ) revealed that the SC is also part of the anxiety network. In particular, this activation documents the possible link between vestibular and anxiety networks. \n\nBeyond this, anxiety and vegetative dysregulation are not only symptoms of acute vestibular vertigo syndromes but can also be the major provoking stimuli of frequent dizziness\/vertigo syndromes like functional phobic postural dizziness (or PPPD) [ ,  ] or visual height intolerance\/acrophobia [ ]. That irrational anxiety of falling rather than the perceived visual height is the causative factor of postural imbalance and height intolerance has also been shown by others [ ,  ]. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere are a number of limitations of the current study: first, we calculated the overlap of two meta-analyses that had different sample sizes and thus different power, so that the meta-analysis with the smaller sample (vestibular stimulation) may have detected fewer regions of convergence than fear conditioning and accordingly reduced the overlap. It is worth reminding here that the two meta-analyses were independent, i.e., they were conducted with different participants at different time points. Second, every meta-analysis can just be as exact as the studies selected as their basis. This restricts conclusions on brainstem activation (not optimized methodological procedures for brainstem imaging or high spatial resolution imaging), the modeling of amygdala response and other functional activations sensitive to timing, but also the application of cluster-based statistical thresholding. An exact localization of processes in the brainstem has therefore to be performed in fMRI studies optimized for high brainstem resolution handling specific problems, such as liquor pulsation, high susceptibility artifacts and spatial normalization problems when an MNI brain normalization is applied (for an early investigation of brainstem functional activation in general see [ ]; for an attempt optimizing brainstem fMRI see [ ]). \n\nIn addition, whereas fear conditioning is perfectly balanced for the parameter fear induction, since CS+\u2009and CS\u2212 differ only with regard to their association with an aversive stimulus in the past, vestibular stimulation paradigms usually contrast the stimulation condition versus baseline (but see also [ ,  ]). Therefore, activation maps in vestibular stimulation studies are much more extended and activation intensity increased compared to a specific CS+\u2009\/CS\u2212 contrast. Thus, a direct contrast between meta-analytic representation maps for each condition was not conducted in the current study. Related to this, non-specific effects of vestibular stimulation may have contributed to the activation patterns in the original fMRI studies. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nEarlier electrophysiological and tracer studies in animals and fMRI\/ PET imaging in humans have established the concept of complex bilateral cerebral networks for the vestibular (for review [ ,  ,  ]) and the fear\/anxiety systems (for review: [ ,  ]). Both networks extend from the caudal pontine brainstem, the vestibular nuclei for the vestibular system [ ,  ] and the parabrachial nuclei for the fear\/anxiety system [ ] to multiple cortex areas. The networks have distinct structures; their operations may be separate or interactive. The current meta-analysis of the neural correlates of vestibular excitation and fear conditioning and their overlap disclosed the brain regions associated with both functions. This is in line with the clinical finding of psychiatric comorbidity and vertigo-related anxiety being maximal with vestibular excitation and minimal with loss of vestibular function [ ,  ]. Future studies should investigate the interaction between fear and vestibular circuits by manipulating both factors in a group of same individuals in a functional imaging study. \n\nRegions exhibiting high overlap in vestibular stimulation and fear conditioning include the anterior insula and anterior cingulate sulcus, whose above discussed structural and functional features are essential for emotional interoception. The posterior cingulate sulcus and superior colliculus mediate multisensory spatial orientation and memory. The antero-medial thalamus with its connection to the prefrontal and temporal lobes and midbrain colliculi is involved in an increased arousal. This is relevant for avoidance of obstacles or other potentially dangerous situations during locomotion in unfamiliar terrains. The superior colliculus is the major hub for reflexive coordinated eye, head, body orientation movements, for instance, recognition and avoidance of unexpected threatening stimuli (fight or fly). The posterior insula and S2 are special in that the contrast for vestibular activations and fear conditioning deactivations resulted in a deactivation of these areas, possibly involved in weakening distressing anxiety and vegetative effects of excessive vestibular stimulations or acute vertigo disorders. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10025232,"text_md5":"d5ee8933c3d86f10cc17811536aed507","field_positions":{"authors":[0,118],"journal":[119,127],"publication_year":[129,133],"title":[144,235],"keywords":[249,358],"abstract":[371,2474],"body":[2483,38861]},"batch":2,"pmid":36723684,"doi":"10.1007\/s00415-023-11568-7","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10025232","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10025232"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10025232\">10025232<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10025232  Common neural correlates of vestibular stimulation and fear learning: an fMRI meta-analysis"}

Prior studies have lacked consistency in identifying common regions of altered neural activity during cognitive tasks. This may be partly due to differences in task paradigm, patient heterogeneity, and methods of fMRI analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method to identify regions of differential brain activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. We included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute time points post-injury. The seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The results of our coordinate based meta-analysis revealed a single cluster of reduced activation within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that differentiated mTBI from healthy controls. We conclude that the cognitive impairments in memory and attention typically reported in mTBI patients may be associated with a deficit in the right MFG, which impacts the recruitment of neural networks important for attentional control. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver the last two decades, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been employed to investigate functional neuroanatomical networks that relate to cognition following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI;  ). Measurement of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in mTBI during cognitive performance can reveal greater increases (i.e. hyperactivation) and decreases (i.e. hypoactivation) in neural activation across a range of brain regions when compared to a healthy control group. A reduction in neural activity compared to controls has been suggested as a disruption of functional efficiency leading to poorer task performance ( ;  ), whereas increased activation has been theorized as compensatory or due to the recruitment of additional resources to facilitate behavioral responses to cognitive demands ( ;  ). \n\nThe earliest example of fMRI research into mTBI reported greater activation in the frontal-temporal and lateral parietal regions, despite similar behavioral performance to controls, during a task of working memory ( ). More recent studies investigating the differences in brain activity between healthy controls and patients with mTBI have identified changes in several areas of the brain that serve higher-order cognitive processes, including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC and VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and posterior areas such as the thalamus and cerebellum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Conversely, other studies have shown decreased activation (i.e. hypoactivation) when tasks examining executive functions were less challenging ( ) and in pediatric samples ( ;  ). Furthermore, some studies have observed no BOLD differences between groups ( ;  ;  ), highlighting issues of inter-subject variability, timing in post-injury assessment, and differences in the method of fMRI analysis ( ). Thus, the use of a quantitative meta-analysis to address experiment-specific variation and identify common mTBI-related neural activation differences across cognitive tasks is warranted. \n\nThe Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis method ( ) is a quantitative voxel-wise meta-analysis technique that compares the results of neuroimaging studies using reported coordinates in a standardized 3D atlas space in order to identify consistently activated neuroanatomical regions. In a meta-analysis using this methodology,   identified several regions of greater and lesser activation in mTBI compared with healthy controls. The pattern of brain activation suggested reduced activity in anterior regions (e.g. bilateral DLPFC and ACC) and increased activity in posterior regions (e.g. cerebellum, insula, and SMG). Additional findings from  , which included an ALE meta-analysis on working memory experiments, suggest that the type of task and its relative cognitive difficulty may also partially explain the differential activation patterns displayed in mTBI patients. \n\nHowever, a recent report of error in multiple-comparison corrections in older versions of the meta-analytic software used by the prior meta-analyses has emerged ( ). Correcting for multiple comparisons by controlling the (voxel-level) false discovery rate (FDR) leads to inflated positive findings ( ;  ). Another limitation from prior meta-analyses is the inclusion of data that is derived from explicit region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. This can lead to inflated significance for the respective regions when included with experiments deriving coordinates from a whole-brain analysis ( ). Furthermore, due to a small number of studies, prior meta-analyses did not have enough power to explore the effects of experimental variables (e.g. timing post-injury) and were prone to yield clusters of convergence that are almost exclusively driven by single experiments ( ;  ). Together, these factors may have resulted in a high number of spurious findings in prior meta-analyses. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a fMRI meta-analysis of cognitive-related activation differences between healthy controls and patients with mTBI using the most recent ALE approach and focusing on studies that met more specific methodological inclusion criteria. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources and search strategy \n  \nA comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify task-based fMRI studies that compared neural responses between patients with mTBI and a healthy control group (see   for an outline of this process). The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid (MEDLINE\u00ae Daily\u00a0+\u00a0Epub Ahead of Print\u00a0+\u00a0In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE Classic\u00a0+\u00a0EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED), EBSCOhost (CINAHL Complete), Wiley Online Library (Cochrane Library), Scopus, and Informit (Health Collection). The searches were confined to full-text research manuscripts published in English and indexed from January 1990 to October 16, 2019.   \nPreferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram. BOLD, blood oxygenation level dependent; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; ROI, region of interest; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  Fig. 1   \n\nDetailed electronic search strategies and syntax were developed in collaboration with a librarian experienced in systematic reviews (see  ). The key search terms included: Glasgow coma outcome; Glasgow coma scale*; score*; unconscious*; Pneumocephalus; rancho los amigos scale; injur*; trauma*; damag*; wound*; fractur*; contusion*; haematoma*; hematoma*; haemorrhag*; hemorrhag*; pressur*; lesion*; destruction*; oedema*; edema*; contusion*; concus*; swell*; bleed*; mild*; minor; mtbi; concuss*; postconcuss*; post-concuss*; posttraum*; post-traum*; symptom*; syndrome*; complaint*; mri; neuroimag*; fmri; function*; magnetic; brain; neuro; imag*; resonance; Blood Volume; Hemoglobins; Oxygen; blood oxygen level dependent; BOLD; oxyhemoglobin; deoxyhemoglobin; memor*; cognit*; executive function*; executive; dysfunction*; Motor Skills; functionality; attention; memory; disorder*; dysfunction; impaired; impairment; difficult*; problem*; disability; organiz*; organis*; plan*; manag*; problem solving; decision making; and disorder. Additional articles were collected by hand-searching reference lists of relevant articles. \n\n\n### Screening and eligibility \n  \nThe assessing author independently evaluated titles and abstracts of identified studies using the web-based reference management program Mendeley (Mendeley Ltd., London, UK). Studies were included if they met the eligibility criteria listed below.   \nReported original data from a task-based fMRI (review papers excluded). \n  \nIncluded an adult sample (> 18 years) of patients diagnosed with a mTBI using criteria similar to or consistent with the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre Task Force definition ( ). \n  \nIncluded a whole brain voxel-based BOLD analysis incorporating a cognitive challenge compared with a control (less challenge or baseline) condition (excluding ROI analyses). \n  \nActivation coordinates reported in standardized stereotaxic space [either MNI ( ) or Talairach ( ) space]. \n  \nIncluded a healthy control group and presented the results of a 2 -level (group-level) mTBI vs control contrast analysis. \n  \n\nWe only included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute (i.e. acute 0\u20137 days, subacute 8\u201389 days) time points post-injury ( ). There are many potential confounding factors that would need to be considered if we examined studies including people who sustained their injuries many months or years prior to imaging. If a study did not report the results of a mTBI group separately from moderate\/severe TBI participants (e.g.  ), they were excluded. Results from pharmacological or psychological intervention experiments were only included if they reported either baseline between-group differences or treatment main effects involving a placebo\/control condition (e.g.  ). If a study conducted an ANOVA analysis, the information equivalent to the mTBI vs. control contrast from the reported group main effects and interactions was selected (e.g.  ). Both greater and lesser (compared to controls) reported activations were included. As the ALE method attempts to identify areas of convergence across significant results, articles that did not report significant findings were unable to be included as there were no coordinates to add to the dataset ( ). For articles that reported results from multiple tasks using the same group (e.g.  ) or used a longitudinal design (e.g.  ), the first contrast of interest was selected to minimize the contribution of any one set of participants to the results from the meta-analysis. We contacted authors of studies who did not report activation coordinates in their paper or presented their results as figures for the additional information (e.g.  ). After initial screening, seven publications fulfilled the aforementioned eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (see   and   for details of the studies and included contrasts).   \nDescription of sample characteristics from the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 1       \nExperiment and contrast specific details of the fMRI publications included in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n### Data Extraction and analysis \n  \nThe following data was extracted from each study: first author; year of publication; demographics of mTBI and control subjects (age, number, sex); time to scan following mTBI (the mean\/range time between injury and fMRI), injury specific information (mechanism, diagnostic criteria, number of symptomatic\/asymptomatic patients and type of measure used, history of previous TBI, and structural imaging findings); task specific (paradigm type, cognitive domain, and if there was a significant difference in behavioral performance between groups); and ALE analysis specific information (source of stereotaxic coordinates, type and number of contrasts included, magnetic field strength (tesla) for fMRI, and whether statistical significance threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons). Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for all 2-group comparisons (the latter was used when the assumptions of normality and variance heterogeneity were violated). \n\n\n### ALE analyses \n  \nWe carried out the ALE meta-analyses using GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org\/ale). ALE assesses the spatial convergence between reported neuroimaging studies by modelling the reported foci in each study as probability distributions centered on their respective coordinates ( ;  ). This version has fixed errors in both FDR and Family Wise Error (FWE) cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous iterations ( ). In brief, a bug in the code that incorrectly sorted   P   values before FDR correction found in versions prior to v.2.3.3 allowed for lenient inferences above the cut-off criterion. Additionally, the procedure for establishing the null-distribution of cluster-sizes for cluster-level FWE thresholding contained an error of including all sizes rather than recording the maximum. Prior to a fix in v2.3.2, this resulted in inference based on uncorrected cluster-level   P   values. We used the non-additive algorithm ( ) to minimize within-experiment effects. Prior to the analyses, coordinates reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using GingerALE's Talairach to MNI conversion tool. The resulting ALE maps were determined at a recommended cluster-level FWE rate-corrected threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, and a cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 with 1000 permutations ( ). \n\nThree separate analyses were conducted: (1) The first analysis (7 experiments, 64 foci, 313 subjects) pooled all comparisons between mTBI patients and healthy controls; (2) the second analysis (4 experiments, 41 foci, 153 subjects) only included contrasts that reported greater brain activity (mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0control) in mTBI relative to the healthy control group; and (3) the third analysis (4 experiments, 23 foci, 222 subjects) tested for areas of decreased activation in the mTBI group (mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls). For illustration, the ALE maps were displayed using MRIcron ( ) with anatomical labelling guided by a Colin27_T1_seg_MNI_2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 template using the Mango visualization program (version 4.0.1.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Description of included studies and participants \n  \nThe seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The average age of the mTBI group was 29.1 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a028.1;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a06.2; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201335; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201338) and more than half were male (57.7%; 95% CI: 44\u201371%). The control group's average age was 29.0 years (  Mdn  \u00a0=\u00a029.9;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a05.3; IQR\u00a0=\u00a025\u201333; range\u00a0=\u00a020\u201334) and more than half were male (59.7%; 95% CI: 47\u201372%). Independent t-tests revealed no significant differences in sample size (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.440), age (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.977), or sex (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.796) between groups. \n\nFunctional imaging was performed at an average of 31.1 days (range = 0\u201369 days) after head injury. The mechanisms of trauma in the mTBI patients included motor vehicle collisions (  n  \u00a0=\u00a033), falls (  n  \u00a0=\u00a037), assault (  n  \u00a0=\u00a04), sport-related concussion (  n  \u00a0=\u00a038), and other mechanisms not defined (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05). Of the five studies that incorporated Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC) into their diagnosis, three reported GCS scores (  M   = 14.5;   SD  \u00a0=\u00a00.5) and 26 individuals with mTBI were identified as having some duration of LOC. Two experiments used sport-related concussion diagnostic guidelines ( ;  ). Four studies included measures of somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms that were all greater in the mTBI group ( ;  ;  ;  ). Seven individuals with a previous history of mTBI were reported in one study ( ). Two studies included subjects with abnormal structural imaging ( ;  ), consisting of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01) and microbleeds (  n  \u00a0=\u00a020). \n\nFour studies used the   n  -back working memory paradigm, two employed attention-based tasks with auditory stimuli, and one study utilized a battery of oculomotor tasks. Block design was used in five of the studies and a 3\u00a0T magnet was used most commonly to acquire imaging data. For six out of seven studies, similar performance was reported on the cognitive tasks between the mTBI group and the control group. Only one study reported a difference in behavioral performance between groups ( ). The method of fMRI analysis was variable across the range of studies and included uncorrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02) and corrected (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05) thresholding. \n\nIncreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with increased activation was 11, 9, 20, and 1 across those studies. Decreased activation in the mTBI group in one or more brain areas was reported in four of seven studies, and the number of foci with decreased activation was 1, 6, 7, and 9 across those studies. One study reported 20 areas of increased activation and 9 areas of decreased activation ( ). \n\n\n### ALE findings \n  \nIn the pooled whole-brain meta-analysis of the seven studies that reported 64 foci of activation, a single activation cluster that differentiated between patients with mTBI and healthy controls was found in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA 9; see   and  ). For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 41 foci of increased activation, there were no significant clusters of increased activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. For the meta-analysis of the four studies reporting 23 foci of decreased activation, the mTBI group showed reduced activation compared with controls within the right MFG (see   and  ).   \nMeta-analytical map of pooled activation in mTBI group.

Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis, and those studies reported inconsistent findings. Across the seven studies, 64 foci of activation, 41 areas of hyperactivation and 23 areas of hypoactivation, were identified. The result of our pooled meta-analysis revealed a single significant activation cluster in the right MFG in those with mTBI compared to controls. Secondary analyses examining the directionality of group contrasts (i.e., mTBI\u00a0>\u00a0controls; mTBI\u00a0<\u00a0controls), revealed less activation in the same cluster in the right MFG in mTBI versus controls. No significant clusters were observed when including contrasts only from experiments reporting greater activations in mTBI. \n\nThe total number of included experiments (  n  \u00a0=\u00a07) was slightly lower compared to previous meta-analyses. Five of the primary studies from   were excluded for being limited to ROI results only ( ;  ;  ), including an adolescent sample ( ), or being a resting-state fMRI study ( ). Similarly, seven studies from   were excluded for reporting on ROI results only ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ), or including an adolescent sample ( ). \n\nThe significant cluster activated in the right MFG during cognitive-based tasks was consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses. However, our study did not support the previous findings of significant clusters in other regions of the frontal-parietal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate) and in more posterior areas (e.g., cerebellar tonsil). These observations could be accounted for by the differences in the studies included and\/or the use of more lenient statistical thresholds used in previous meta-analyses. In the current meta-analysis, the right MFG was reported as a region of activation in five out of seven of the included studies. Examining the results from these studies, three reported a statistically significant reduction in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ;  ), and two reported statistically significant increases in activation in the right MFG ( ;  ). Potential sources of this variation may be explained by differences in experimental design, analytical methodology, and participant characteristics ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nWithin the prefrontal cortex, the MFG is connected to a network of regions that are commonly co-activated during tasks requiring executive functions ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, the right MFG has been proposed to be a convergence site between the ventral attention network (VAN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), which work in conjunction to switch between goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention by filtering out distractions and orienting attention to task-relevant information ( ;  ). This region has been suggested to be \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d that interrupts DAN functioning to reorient attention towards novel task-relevant stimuli ( ;  ). In the context of mTBI, previous functional neuroimaging studies have reported differential activation in the right MFG area across a variety of cognitive paradigms with the majority of tasks involving working memory ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Taken together, altered recruitment of the right MFG after mTBI may represent an over-arching disruption in modulating attention. These findings are also consistent with resting-state fMRI studies in concussion and mTBI, which have observed altered functional connectivity in the right MFG ( ) as well as other regions that mediate internally-oriented processes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs evidenced in our included experiments (see  ), the   n  -back paradigm is the most frequently used working memory task in the current mTBI literature. It is used to assess an individual's ability to hold information in mind for further processing while subject to increasing cognitive demand ( ). Working memory is an area of cognition that has been found to be adversely affected by mTBI ( ;  ;  ). Further, problems with working memory also emerge during the early recovery phase rather than forming part of the initial symptomology ( ). Our finding of disturbed right MFG activation in mTBI patients may therefore reflect atypical neurophysiological changes associated with cognitive impairments in memory and attention. This view is supported by functional differentiation evidence that show the right MFG as an area of focus in task demand\/novelty processing ( ;  ). \n\nA novel finding in the present work is that contrast-specific involvement of the right MFG was apparent for our analysis that incorporated hypoactivation findings and not for those that reported hyperactivation. Various authors have attempted to conceptualize the directionality of recruitment in the prefrontal region following brain injury in relation to task performance. It has been proposed that greater activation in response to a cognitively demanding task may represent a transient compensatory effect ( ;  ), permanent rewiring ( ;  ), or the result of a native support mechanism to assist in task performance ( ;  ). Conversely, underactivity (i.e. hypoactivation) may reflect a disruption in this network caused by pathophysiological changes which limit the capacity for focused attention and external goal directed processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Of note, cognitive task performance was mostly equivalent between our meta-analysis group of mTBI and healthy controls (see  ). In six out of seven studies, the mTBI group performed similarly to the control group on the cognitive task. One methodological constraint with imaging research is requiring near perfect accuracy on tasks to facilitate data interpretation ( ). Furthermore, recruitment demand for prefrontal regions following brain injury has been shown to diminish at similar rates in both injured and healthy controls with increased task practice and familiarity ( ). Thus, while our findings are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying cause are unclear. \n\nFrom   and  , the description of participant characteristics highlights the scope and context of inter-subject variation in mTBI. Within our mTBI group, the number of sport-related concussions, motor vehicle accidents, and falls as injury mechanisms was relatively similar. However, biomechanical loading data reveal that primary injury strain and impact forces vary considerably depending on injury mechanism and are not uniformly distributed across grey and white matter regions of the brain ( ;  ). Previous reviews into the adaptive and pathophysiological changes following mTBI ( ;  ) also highlight the issue of a complex and time-varied injury profile. Although we limited the scope of functional assessment post-injury to the acute-subacute phase, there is no clear consensus on how these processes affect recovery as measured by fMRI after mTBI ( ). This is evidenced in longitudinal fMRI studies which showcase varied patterns of within-subject BOLD signal changes ( ;  ;  ). Finally, it is important to note the subset of subjects with complications identified on structural scans. Whereas some definitions of mTBI include patients with intracranial imaging abnormalities ( ), it is increasingly more common in current studies to reclassify mTBI into uncomplicated and complicated dichotomies based on CT\/MRI findings ( ). However, symptom outcomes associated with structural findings remains inconsistent ( ;  ). Even though our activation clusters were not driven by singular studies (see  ), it is important to consider these inter-subject variability factors regarding the outcome of inferential analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nA vital consideration for the current meta-analysis and for fMRI methodology in general, is that the vasculature that underlies the BOLD signal can be impaired following brain trauma. Alterations in cerebral blood flow, perfusion, and vascular reactivity have all been found following mTBI ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Alteration in the cerebrovascular dynamics can lead to subsequent change in the ratio of intravascular oxy- to deoxyhemoglobin, which contribute to the BOLD signal ( ;  ). For example, a recent series of fMRI studies found that the shape and magnitude of the signal can differentiate between a sample of mTBI patients and controls ( ,  ). While the authors found signal disturbance within several areas in the mTBI group, most cortical and subcortical regions involved during the visual tracking tasks were normal. Therefore, it remains to be known whether these secondary pathophysiological changes affect the BOLD signal across the entire brain or only the most vulnerable areas ( ). Ideally, future studies should measure baseline cerebrovascular parameters (e.g. cerebral blood flow) to partial out any potential effect of neurovascular uncoupling due to alterations in vascular physiology. \n\nCompared to previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, we used the latest version of ALE software and included several additional studies not previously incorporated ( ;  ; van der Horn et\u00a0al., 2016;  ). Additionally, we did not include any study that used an explicit ROI analysis ( ;  ,  ;  ) or adolescent population ( ;  ). While our study represents the most up-to-date literature search of fMRI findings in mTBI, our conservative inclusion criteria limited the total number of experiments available. Owing to the low numbers of experiments, our ALE meta-analysis may not have had enough power to completely partial out subject-specific variation ( ). Separate exploratory meta-analyses investigating the effect of task domain and type, behavioral performance, time after injury, age, and corrected threshold contrast could not be performed due to strict inclusion criteria and the number of experiments available ( ). Future studies addressing these variations will lead to improved research outcomes and a better understanding of the impaired functional networks that may underlie cognitive dysfunction in mTBI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the present meta-analysis employed a coordinate-based ALE approach to identify affected brain areas relating to cognitive dysfunction following mTBI. We used GingerALE v.2.3.6 (brainmap.org\/ale), a version of ALE that has fixed errors in both FDR and FWE cluster-level thresholding calculation codes identified in previous versions of the program. Our results revealed neural activation differences across a variety of cognitive tasks, with the mTBI group displaying hypoactivation within the right MFG. Consistent with prior meta-analyses ( ;  ) this finding suggests that the prefrontal region may be particularly affected following mTBI. However, although these results are in support of functional change in the neuroanatomical region of the MFG, the direction of change (i.e. greater or lesser activation) and the underlying causes remain unclear and require future study. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nMichael J.

Research on this topic has been quite prolific, yet no meta-analysis so far has explored the spatial convergence in the involvement of the two streams in Action. The present meta-analysis (N\u00a0=\u00a053 fMRI and PET studies) was designed to reveal the specific neural activations associated with Action (i.e., grasping and reaching movements), and the extent to which visual information affects the involvement of the two streams during motor control. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the consistent and spatially convergent neural correlates of Action based on neuroimaging studies conducted over the past two decades. In particular, occipital-temporal areas showed higher activation likelihood in the Vision compared to the No vision condition, but no difference between reach and grasp actions. Frontal-parietal areas were consistently involved in both reach and grasp actions regardless of visual availability. We discuss our results in light of the well-established dual-visual stream model and frame these findings in the context of recent discoveries obtained with advanced fMRI methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis. \n   Graphical abstract  \n  Image 1   \n   Highlights  \n  \nAn influential model on the specialization of ventral and dorsal visual stream in Perception and Action was proposed in 1992 by Goodale and Milner. \n  \nThe advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed investigating the brain areas involved in Perception and Action. \n  \nThis meta-analysis reveals the spatial convergence in the involvement of the two streams in Action, and the influence of visual information. \n  \nYet very little attempt has been made so far to identify consistent neuroimaging results across the available literature. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOver the last three decades, the investigation of the neuroanatomical substrates of goal-directed hand action has received increasing attention. Indeed, hand movements not only allow us to interact with our surroundings, but also enable us to satisfy our basic needs. A deep and comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed hand action is crucial for advancements in many research areas, such as the ever-growing field of brain-computer interfaces for individuals who have limited or no ability to perform volitional movements. \n\nOne of the most prominent theories about action and perception was put forward by Goodale and Milner in 1992 and is based on behavioural and neuropsychological findings that show a specialization of the dorsal stream in action and the ventral stream in perception ( ). Specifically, the original model describes the functional specialization of the parietal cortex in processing spatial information that is relevant for planning and executing action, and the temporal-occipital cortex in recognition of contents. The proposed two-visual streams model has received much interest, including support and criticism, and it has been a matter of debate for almost three decades (see  ;  ). \n\nThe advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed investigating the brain areas involved in action and perception and provided useful data on this topic. Despite the challenges related to studying the execution of motor actions with neuroimaging techniques, among which the confined environment of the MR and the risk of inducing motion artifacts, research on the functional specialization of the two streams has been quite prolific (e.g.,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Yet very little attempt has been made so far to determine the consistency in neuroimaging results across the published studies, with only one recent study which summarizes the existing data with systematic research and a meta-analytical approach ( ). \n\nIn addition to the specialization of the dorsal and ventral stream in action and perception, respectively, according to the dual-stream theory both streams are involved in processing vision for action, but with different purposes ( ;  ). Specifically, while the dorsal visual stream is specialized in the online control of visually-guided actions, the ventral visual stream processes short-term maintenance of the object representation in memory, and, as a consequence, it is thought to support the guidance of delayed actions in absence of online visual information (i.e. when the brief visual presentation of a stimulus and the action towards it are separated by a delay). Seminal evidence comes from neuropsychological observations of patients suffering from optic ataxia ( ), on the one side, and patients suffering from visual agnosia, on the other side ( ). Optic ataxia is due to dorsal stream lesions and consists of a deficit in reaching towards objects in the visual periphery. Visual agnosia is caused by ventral stream lesions which impair the visual recognition of objects and shapes. Importantly, while optic ataxia patients perform more accurate actions with than without a delay ( ,  ), visual agnosia patients show the opposite pattern ( ), in line with the idea that while the dorsal stream is crucial for online control of immediate actions, the ventral stream permits maintenance of object representation in memory for delayed actions. The importance of such findings about delayed actions resides in the fact that in principle they comprise a big portion of the actions that we perform in our everyday life. For example, when we grab our car keys from a pocket or change the shift while keeping our eyes on the street, we need to retrieve information from memory about our keys and car shift as we cannot directly look at them while we plan and perform the action. \n\nVentral and dorsal visual streams are also differently recruited for immediate and delayed actions. Specifically, while the dorsal stream (i.e., intraparietal sulcus) plays a role in immediate and delayed actions, the ventral stream (i.e., lateral temporal-occipital cortex) might have a more prominent role in delayed actions only. In particular, neuroimaging studies showed that during delayed actions areas in the dorsal and ventral stream are re-activated when a movement is performed in absence of visual information ( ;  ;  ). In addition to these findings, some fMRI studies showed that the early visual cortex (EVC), on or slightly above the Calcarine sulcus, is reactivated during delayed actions in the dark ( ;  ;  ). Further, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies determined that while the dorsal stream has a causal role in performing immediate and delayed actions ( ;  ), the ventral stream is crucial for delayed but not immediate actions ( ). \n\nOne of the controversies about previous findings on the involvement of dorsal and ventral stream areas in goal-directed hand actions arises from the fact that not all results point to the involvement of the ventral stream and the EVC in delayed actions without online visual feedback. Indeed, some fMRI studies found reactivation in dorsal but not ventral stream areas during the execution of an action after a delay ( ), while other studies found reactivation in the ventral stream and EVC during action execution in the dark after a delay ( ;  ;  ). Further, the reactivation in visual areas for delayed actions in the dark was higher for grasping than reaching actions, perhaps because grasping requires the retrieval of more detailed information, such as size and shape, than reaching. Yet, no attempt has been made to assess the consistency of results across the literature in a systematic manner. \n\nIn this study we exploited the potential of coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies ( ;  ), to explore the neural bases of hand reaching and grasping, performed with and without online visual feedback (i.e., after a delay following the presentation of the target object or in total darkness). We focused on studies investigating hand reaching and grasping because reach-to-grasp is probably the most representative human skilled-action, and it has been extensively investigated to test and confirm the dual-visual stream theory ( ). We based our literature search and article selection on a recent study by  , where a systematic review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on the execution of reach and grasp actions has been provided for a comparison between brain areas involved in number processing and grasping and reaching actions. Meta-analytical studies have proven to be important for the assessment of consistency across neuroimaging studies ( ). Indeed, they enable us to get a summary of the brain areas (i.e., activation clusters) that are active during a particular task, or involved in a cognitive domain, across all the studies published so far. \n\nThe main objective of the current study was to elucidate the brain areas consistently recruited during the execution and guidance of skilled actions, specifically hand reaching and grasping actions, when visual information of the target object and\/or the hand is available, and when it is not. More specifically, the present work aimed at addressing two main aims. First, we investigated whether activation in the ventral stream and EVC is found only during the execution of actions with vision or also in complete darkness (aim 1). The former hypothesis would be expected based on the wide body of evidence showing the involvement of temporal-occipital areas in the processing of visual information ranging from simple to complex visual features. The latter hypothesis is suggested by findings that show reactivation of ventral stream areas and EVC during delayed actions performed in complete darkness after a brief presentation of a stimulus ( ). This reactivation is likely related to memory components. To address this aim, we performed two meta-analyses, one including all the studies investigating the execution of reaching and grasping with online visual feedback, and the other one including the experiments exploring the execution of the same actions without visual feedback, and therefore relying on memory. We then directly compared (through a contrast analysis) the two sets of studies (i.e., reaching and grasping with vision vs. without vision) to identify the visual areas that show consistently higher activation for actions executed with as compared to without visual input. Given the well-known role of the ventral stream and EVC in visual perception, we expected to find it consistently activated during actions executed with online visual feedback, as the visual input of the target or the hand approaching the target are being processed ( ;  ). The critical question was whether the ventral stream and early visual areas also show consistent activation during actions performed without visual feedback, given the divergent results on the involvement of ventral stream areas in delayed actions (i.e.,  ;  ). Second, we assessed whether reaching and grasping differentially recruit ventral and dorsal stream areas (aim 2). Some studies have shown that grasping elicits higher activation than reaching actions in the ventral stream and EVC ( ;  ). This might be related to the fact that grasping, but not reaching, requires detailed information about the object properties, such as size and shape, to perform an accurate movement. Although in these studies the visual component of the object is ruled out by the contrast of Grasp vs. Reach, the way in which the object is processed differs between the two actions. Indeed, grasping requires processing the object by taking into account also cognitive aspects, for instance: 1) where to place the digits on the object for accurate, stable, and comfortable grasp; 2) the size of the object; 3) the texture of the object to determine whether it is slippery. Some of these properties are known to be processed in ventral stream areas ( ;  ;  ). As such, we hypothesized consistently higher activation in ventral stream and early visual areas for grasp than reach tasks. To address this aim, we performed two meta-analyses including the experiments investigating: grasping, on one side, and reaching, on the other side. Lastly, we ran a contrast analysis between grasping and reaching (i.e., grasping vs. reaching). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Studies selection \n  \nThe procedure used for the selection of the studies is described in detail in  . The data associated with this study is publicly available and can be found at: \n\n. \n\nTo summarize, the literature search was conducted until December 30, 2020 (for a detailed description of the literature searching process, see PRISMA flow diagram, Annex A). To the best of our knowledge, there was no study published after this date that could be included in this meta-analysis. We identified 565 studies through a database search with Pubmed and bioRxiv on hand reaching and grasping. Further, 454 studies were identified with the use of the \u201crelated articles\u201d function, available in the Pubmed database, and the backward and forward snowballing search strategy, i.e., reference list and citations of primary articles, reviews, and meta-analyses. This selection process led to a total of 1020 studies. After removing duplicates, a total of 954 studies were originally identified to undergo further scrutiny at a later stage. \n\nStudies had to respect the following inclusion criteria to be included in the current meta-analysis:   \nto have written the paper in the English language. \n  \nto use a hand reaching and\/or grasping task. \n  \nto investigate brain activity during the action execution phase (i.e., studies that focused on brain activity during the planning phase were excluded). This ensured consistency across the selected studies, where the elicited activation reflected somatosensory feedback and motor outputs, which are absent during the planning phase preceding action execution. This criterion was added to the ones used in the study by  , where the execution as well as the planning phase preceding the movement were considered. As such, five studies were excluded from our meta-analysis ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ). \n  \nto use fMRI or positron emission tomography (PET) to collect data about neural activity. \n  \nto have conducted whole-brain analyses (e.g., studies that use a region of interest (ROI) approach were excluded, as it focuses on predefined areas of the image rather than reporting all activated clusters and could thus bias the result of the meta-analysis;  ). \n  \nto have performed univariate analyses (i.e., papers that conducted multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) or functional connectivity analyses were not included). It is important to note that MVPA and univariate analysis produce different types of data (i.e., percentage of classification accuracy vs. extent of activation). Therefore, the meta-analysis of multivariate data is based on values of decoding accuracies (e.g.,  ), which cannot be collapsed with univariate results. To date, the number of MVPA studies on this topic is not large enough to conduct a meta-analytic procedure ( ,  ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). \n  \nto report a contrast that shows larger activation level for reaching or grasping than the control condition, i.e., when the contrast shows activation rather than deactivation. The control condition differs from the experimental condition only in the dimension of interest. As such, it depends on the task used in each original study. Examples of control conditions are passive viewing (look), reach, colour detection, simple fingers movement, etc. \n  \nto report findings in either Talairach ( ) or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) coordinate space (i.e., studies not reporting results in a standardized coordinate space were excluded). \n  \nto have included only healthy adults in the experiment. \n  \nto test a sample size of at least 5 participants. \n  \n\n\n### Systematic review \n  \nThe literature was screened in detail and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected in accordance with PRISMA guidelines ( ) by  . We checked that the screening procedure was in line with the updated PRISMA guidelines that have been recently published ( ). In addition, we followed recent recommendations on how to conduct a proper neuroimaging meta-analysis ( ). The screening procedure is described in more detail in the PRISMA flow diagram available in Annex A. For the current meta-analysis, 53 studies met the inclusion criteria reported in the previous section. The complete list of included studies is presented in Annex B. \n\nData were extracted from the studies and then checked. We then created a database containing the following information of the selected articles on hand reaching and grasping actions: the sample size, the percentage of females, the mean age of participants, the technique (either fMRI or PET), the experimental task (only grasp, only reach, or reach and grasp), the control task, additional information about the task and stimuli, the relevant contrast selected, the coordinate system, the coordinates of foci and their anatomical labels, the p-value criteria (corrected, uncorrected), and the related statistic (z score, t value). \n\nIn the case of multiple contrasts performed in a single study and on the same group of participants, only the most relevant one was considered (i.e., the contrast that best represents the process under investigation in the present meta-analysis). This approach ensures that there is no dependence across the activation maps of the included experiments which would instead negatively impact the validity of meta-analytic results ( ). As a result of the application of this approach, we eventually selected only one contrast from each of the eligible studies, thus yielding a final list of 53 experiments (i.e., contrasts), consisting of 528 foci, included in the current meta-analysis. We then divided the studies into four categories consisting of two movements (Grasp and Reach) and two levels of visual information (Vision and No vision), as described here below. \n\n\n### Data categorization \n  \nFor the purpose of the current meta-analysis, we further analysed each of the 53 studies in order to extract additional information about the experimental task and the contrast used. In fact, while   performed a meta-analysis of the areas involved in grasping and reaching actions by collapsing the availability of visual information, we further categorized the 53 studies depending on the level of visual information isolated by the contrast. Further, we performed a direct comparison between grasping and reaching studies that was not performed by  . \n\nReaching tasks consisted of moving the hand towards the object with the pointing finger or the knuckles. Grasping tasks consisted of moving the hand towards the object and grasping it with a precision or a whole hand grasp. While some of the studies in this meta-analysis employed either reach or grasp tasks, others included both movement types. Some studies also included ad-hoc control conditions (i.e., passive viewing of the target object). Tasks consisting in moving the arm and hand to the target, without a grip component, were categorized as Reach. Tasks that included the grip component, with or without the movement of the arm towards the target, were categorized as Grasp. For example, the contrasts of: (Grasp vs. Reach), and (Grasp vs. Passive viewing) were both labelled as Grasp, as they both included the grip component (note that this procedure partially differs from the one of  , where a distinction between reach-only, grasp-only, and reach-to-grasp studies was made). \n\nWe then assessed whether the experimental paradigm required participants to perform goal-directed hand actions in total darkness (i.e., participants could not see their moving hand or the target object; No vision condition) or in a dimly light room (i.e., participants could see their own hand moving and the target object or a visual stimulus projected onto a screen; Vision condition). For experiments performed under dim light illumination sufficient to process visual stimuli during action execution, we determined whether the contrast used in the study allowed subtracting neural activity elicited by the visual stimuli and\/or the hand performing the movement. If so, we included these contrasts in the No vision condition along with the studies in which participants performed goal-directed movements in complete darkness. \n\nAs a result, we classified the selected studies into the following categories: 1) reaching experiments that isolated neural activity elicited by the somato-motor component of the reaching movement without vision (Reach No vision; number of studies (N)\u00a0=\u00a013); 2) reaching experiments in which visual information about the hand or the target was present in addition to the somato-motor component of the reaching movement (Reach Vision; N\u00a0=\u00a03); 3) grasping experiments that isolated neural activity elicited by the somato-motor component of the grasping movement without vision (Grasp No vision; N\u00a0=\u00a020); 4) grasping experiments in which vision was present in addition to the somato-motor component of the grasping movement (Grasp Vision; N\u00a0=\u00a017). The No vision category includes studies in which vision was not available during the task, as well as studies in which vision of the object was available before movement execution but was removed by the contrast used. The Vision category includes visual processing of the object, hand, or both. Specifically, there are studies where vision was available: 1) before action execution, allowing only vision of the target (i.e.,  ); 2) during the execution of the movement, allowing vision of the target and the moving hand (i.e.,  ); and 3) throughout the movement, and the contrast used (Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Reach) removed information about the object but not visual processing of the grasping hand (i.e.,  ). The Grasp category includes studies in which the grip component is isolated with or without the transport component. The Reach category includes studies where a grip component is not present. \n\n reports a summary of the studies, contrasts, and isolated components included in each category.   \nComponents isolated by the contrasts used in the studies included for each category in the meta-analysis. \n  Table 1     \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis \n  \nWe conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) which uses the coordinates of activation peaks (i.e., activation foci) reported in a standardized coordinate space. We employed the ALE method ( ;  ) to conduct the coordinate-based meta-analysis of selected fMRI and PET experiments. In particular, the revised version of the ALE algorithm ( ,  ) was run with BrainMap GingerALE software version 3.0.2 (Research Imaging Institute; http:\/\/brainmap. org\/ale\/). The MNI coordinates of activation peaks were converted into Talairach space before performing the meta-analysis. We transformed the coordinate space for as few studies as possible. Since more than half of the studies included in this meta-analysis (30 out of 53) reported coordinates in TAL space, we converted the MNI coordinates to TAL space. \n\nThe ALE algorithm aims at evaluating the brain areas of spatial convergence of activated foci across neuroimaging experiments using the coordinates of the peak activations extracted from individual studies. In particular, the algorithm models the reported activated foci of each experiment as three-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions. The number of participants in each experiment is considered to compute the size of the probability distributions. The uncertainty associated with the spatial location of activated foci due to between-study variances (e.g., between-subject and between-template variances;  ) is considered, quantified and used by the ALE algorithm to compute the width of each Gaussian distribution. The probability distributions of all activation foci extracted from an experiment are then combined voxelwise to obtain a Modelled Activation (MA) map, that is a map (i.e., 3D volume) of activation likelihood that is generated for each included experiment. For each meta-analysis, all the MA maps are combined voxelwise to create an ALE map. Each voxel of this image contains an ALE score which represents the spatial convergence of activated foci at exactly that position ( ). The ALE scores are then tested against a null hypothesis according to which the concordance in spatial activation between experiments can occur by chance and is therefore random (noise;  ), by applying a random-effects spatial inference (i.e., random effects model) instead of a fixed-effects inference to evaluate the agreement on activation peaks across studies. The ALE algorithm uses a permutation procedure to assign each voxel a P value which stems from the probabilities of obtaining an ALE value not equal to the ALE value of the very same voxel based on the null-distribution. We employed Mango software ( ), a multi-image analysis program, to visualize the results of the meta-analysis by overlaying ALE maps onto an anatomical image in Talairach space. \n\n#### Single dataset and contrast analyses \n  \nWe ran four single dataset and two contrast analyses to examine the areas involved in the execution of reaching and grasping movements with and without the availability of visual information. While single dataset analysis indicates the main results of the studies included in each category, the contrast analysis allows comparing results between two different categories (i.e., datasets). In order to examine which areas are consistently involved in visual and non-visual reaching and grasping actions, we performed two meta-analyses separately for each of the two visual conditions across action types: 1) Reach and Grasp Vision, and 2) Reach and Grasp No vision. Further, to investigate which areas are selectively involved in online visual processing during action execution, we performed a contrast analysis of: 3) Reach and Grasp Vision\u00a0>\u00a0Reach and Grasp No vision. To investigate the cortical areas specifically involved in grasping and reaching tasks, regardless of the availability of visual information, we ran two single dataset analyses for each action type (Grasp, Reach) across the two visual conditions: 4) Grasp Vision and No vision, 5) Reach Vision and No vision. Lastly, to determine which areas consistently show higher activation for grasping than reaching movements, we ran the contrast analysis of: 6) Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Reach. \n\nFor the single dataset meta-analyses, all the resulting statistical ALE maps were thresholded by means of a cluster-level family-wise error (cFWE) correction at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (5,000 permutations) with a cluster-forming threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 (uncorrected), in line with the latest recommendations for neuroimaging meta-analyses ( ). \n\nTo perform the contrast analyses, we followed the recommendation of   according to which two datasets are comparable when one is at most four times bigger than the other one (and vice versa), in terms of number of studies. Therefore, the sample size of studies included in the contrast analyses was: Reach and Grasp Vision (N\u00a0=\u00a020) vs. Reach and Grasp No vision (N\u00a0=\u00a033), and Grasp (N\u00a0=\u00a037) vs. Reach (N\u00a0=\u00a016). During the analysis, the ALE algorithm repeatedly and randomly splits the pooled list of foci into two separate sets of data while keeping their original sizes. Afterwards, an ALE map is generated for each new dataset, and one is subtracted from the other one (and vice versa); eventually, for each voxel the difference is computed between this new experimental ALE map and the original ALE map. For the current meta-analysis, the ALE algorithm used 10,000 permutations to perform the contrast analyses. The uncorrected threshold and the minimum cluster volume were set at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and to 100\u00a0mm^3, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAn overview of all areas involved in the execution of reaching and grasping actions, regardless of whether or not vision is available, can be found in   (see in the article by  : Figure 2, Panel b; Figure 4, Panels a and b). \n\n### Meta-analytical map of Reach and Grasp Vision \n  \nThe Reach and Grasp Vision ALE meta-analysis included a total of 298 subjects, and 168 foci extracted from 20 eligible experiments.

As for the dorsal stream, we found that it was consistently involved in grasping as well as reaching actions, regardless of the availability of visual information. This is in line with the dual-stream theory, postulating that the dorsal stream is involved in the execution of reach and grasp actions. As for the ventral stream, we found that it was involved in actions executed with but not without online visual feedback. Specifically, the temporal-occipital cortex showed higher activation likelihood for the Vision than No vision condition. In addition, the ventral stream showed comparable activation likelihood for grasping and reaching actions. Below, we discuss the main findings of the present meta-analysis and the potential functional role of ventral stream areas in action guidance and execution. \n\n### Processing of visual information during goal-directed hand actions \n  \nThe two single-dataset meta-analyses on actions with and without vision, and the contrast analysis between Vision and No vision enabled us to examine the role of vision in temporal-occipital areas during action execution (aim 1). \n\nThe meta-analytical map on hand reaching and grasping with vision ( , Panel a) revealed consistent activation across the studies in frontal, parietal, and right cerebellar regions, as well as in the occipito-temporal cortex. These findings are expected given the known role of the dorsal stream in action and the ventral stream in perception. Indeed, the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and the lateral occipital cortices are known to be involved in visual perception and recognition of object categories and body parts, including the hand ( ;  ;  ;  ; for reviews see  ;  ). Similarly, the posterior areas of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) process category and motion-related information ( ). These results are consistent with the fact that in the selected Vision conditions participants viewed the target and their moving hand while approaching the target. \n\nAs for actions performed without online visual feedback, the meta-analytical map showed significant activation in six cortical clusters covering both the left and right hemispheres; specifically, they included parietal areas, such as bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), precuneus, superior parietal lobule (SPL), and left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), and frontal areas like bilateral precentral gyrus (PreCG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and left insula. The clusters in the posterior parietal cortex for the No vision category are likely related to motor planning and reliance on somatosensory feedback. Another possible and non-exclusive interpretation is related to the recruitment of working memory mechanisms in the parietal cortex that support the guidance of actions in absence of visual information ( ;  ). Importantly, no cluster was found in the ventral visual stream ( , Panel b). Therefore, despite some evidence supporting the involvement of the ventral stream in goal-directed actions performed in the dark after a delay ( ;  ), there is no consistency in support of the recruitment of ventral visual stream areas during the control and execution of skilled actions in the absence of visual input. In line with this result, the contrast analysis did not reveal any cluster in the temporal-occipital cortex ( , Panel c). Interestingly, the contrast did reveal clusters of activation spanning the left PreCG and PoCG, two clusters in the right hemisphere located mainly in frontal areas, such as PreCG, inferior and middle frontal gyrus (IFG and MFG, respectively), and an additional cluster in the anterior lobe of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Therefore, these areas are more engaged when visual information is available as opposed to when it is not. The higher consistency in brain activation for Vision than No vision in motor-related areas is in line with a seminal neurophysiology study in primates by  , which demonstrated the presence of bimodal visual and tactile neurons in macaques' ventral premotor cortex, typically known to be involved in motor control. Our results suggest that bimodal neurons might also be present in humans\u2019 premotor cortex, which is recruited by vision of a target to be acted upon that requires the processing of affordances and spatial information for accurate action performance. \n\nWe found no activation cluster in the EVC for Vision and No vision conditions. The lack of activation clusters in the EVC in the Vision condition can be explained by the fact that some of the studies included in the Vision condition used a contrast of Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Look. Therefore, the visual processing of the object was removed by the contrast. Since in such tasks vision of the hand was available throughout the movement, we included these studies in the Vision condition. However, the inclusion of contrasts subtracting some activity related to visual processing might have reduced the sensitivity to detect activation in early visual areas. Also, while univariate analysis might lack the sensitivity to reveal activation in ventral stream areas and EVC under lack of vision, recent MVPA studies have shown different representations for grasping and reaching action planning with and without visual information in ventral stream and early visual areas ( , ;  ,  . This difference in results indicates that univariate and multivariate analysis provide complementary and not necessarily equivalent information, with MVPA being more sensitive to distributed representation of information of content, and univariate analysis that shows more sensitivity to the overall engagement in a task ( ;  ;  ). \n\nOverall, these results indicate the consistent involvement of the parietal and frontal cortex in the execution of grasping and reaching actions regardless of the availability of visual information, while the temporal-occipital cortex is recruited only when vision is available. Notably, the same frontal and parietal areas have been recently shown to process magnitude representations ( ). Consistently, grasping and reaching actions require the processing of space-related magnitude information, such as the location of the target in space for reaching, as well as its size for grasping. \n\n\n### Processing of grasping and reaching \n  \nThe second aim of the current study was to assess whether ventral and dorsal stream areas are differentially recruited during the execution of reaching and grasping (aim 2). \n\nThe meta-analytical map of hand grasping revealed consistent activation clusters in the frontal and parietal cortex, as well as in the anterior lobe of the right cerebellar hemisphere ( , Panel a). Moreover, a significant cluster of activation was located in the left inferior temporal cortex, more precisely in the ITG, and the fusiform gyrus. The inferior temporal cortex, including the ITG, plays a well-known role in the visual perception and recognition of objects, scenes, and hands ( ;  ;  ;  ) and it has been shown that the fusiform gyrus might store semantic information about the object shape ( ; see also  ). Therefore, neural activation in these areas might underpin the visual processing of object properties and semantic representation during grasping actions. \n\nSimilarly, the meta-analytical map of hand reaching revealed five cortical clusters covering both hemispheres ( , Panel b). Specifically, a network of frontal, parietal, and temporal-occipital regions was consistently activated across the literature. Moreover, the network for reaching appeared more bilateral than the one for grasping, in line with previous findings that show a lateralization of the activation for grasping movements ( ;  ). \n\nAlthough we initially hypothesized that the ventral stream may show more clusters of activation for grasping than reaching, the results of our contrast do not support our hypothesis. Indeed, no temporal-occipital area was found in the meta-analytical contrast of Grasp vs. Reach ( , Panel c). A possible explanation is related to the fact that the single dataset analyses for grasping and reaching showed similar results. This could be due to the inclusion of tasks that isolated the grip as well as the transport component (12 out of 37 studies) in our Grasp category. Further, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), typically known to be involved in grasping actions, does not show any activation cluster with the contrast of Grasp vs. Reach. This (lack of) finding can be explained by the fact that the aIPS is sensitive to the precision required by a grasping movement, rather than the number of digits or lift component ( ). Part of the studies included in our Grasp category have contrasted between types of grasps that required different hand configurations but the same precision (e.g., gentle precision grip vs. firm precision grip,  ). Overall, these meta-analyses revealed that reaching and grasping under the two visual conditions recruited similar networks that span the temporal-occipital and frontal-parietal cortex. Indeed, the contrast analysis showed only a few clusters in the right cerebellum and precentral gyrus, likely related to the finer motor control of the fingers during a grasping as compared to a reaching movement. The right lateralization of the post-central gyrus for the contrast of Grasp vs. Reach is unexpected and could be due to the use of grasp tasks that required moving the left hand ( ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations of the study \n  \nThe present meta-analysis has important strengths, as it is the first work to define the consistency across neuroimaging studies on goal-directed hand actions with and without online visual information over the last two decades. In addition, this study provides a further confirmation of the brain areas involved in the control of skilled actions ( ;  ; for additional meta-analytical results, see also  ). Furthermore, we provide an overview of the areas recruited while reaching out and grasping objects, with and without online visual feedback. This aspect is of particular importance. Indeed, despite the consensus in the literature on the involvement of the frontal and parietal cortex in the guidance of reaching and grasping, there is compelling evidence suggesting that also the temporal-occipital cortex might play a role (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ), especially in recent neuroimaging studies that have employed multivariate analysis which allows identifying representations rather than extent of activation ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Therefore, our meta-analysis attempted to clarify the debate on the potential involvement of the temporal-occipital cortex in the guidance of skilled actions as investigated with univariate analysis. \n\nThere are also some limitations to our work. One of them consists in the fact that half of the experiments categorized as Grasp Vision used a contrast that included visual processing elicited by the view of the reaching limb and grasping hand (i.e., Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Look) or view of the grasping hand only (i.e., Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Reach, Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Point, Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Touch, Grasp\u00a0>\u00a0Different grasp). However, this fine-grained categorization might have hampered the possibility to find consistent activation in brain areas associated with visual processing during action execution in presence of vision. As a consequence, it might have likely hindered the contrast analysis between the two vision conditions (i.e., Reach and Grasp Vision\u00a0>\u00a0No vision) which did not show any significant cluster of activation associated with visual processing in the EVC. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this coordinate-based meta-analysis is the first attempt to investigate spatial convergence across the available literature in relation to the involvement of temporal-occipital and frontal-parietal cortex in reaching and grasping actions performed with and without online visual feedback. Our findings reconcile the existing neuroimaging literature on actions that employed standard univariate analysis, by emphasizing the complementary role of more recent techniques, such as multivoxel pattern analysis, to the current knowledge on cortical areas involved in hand movements. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Samantha Sartin:   Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

However, the findings were inconsistent in studies using different neuroimaging analyses. This meta-analytic study aimed to identify a common pattern of altered brain activity from different studies. Resting-state fMRI studies, based on whole-brain analysis methods published before July 1, 2021, were searched in multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science). A voxel-based signed differential mapping (SDM) method was used to clarify brain regions, which showed anomalous activity in PIU subjects compared with healthy controls (HCs). Ten eligible publications consisting of 306 PIU subjects and 314 HCs were included in the SDM meta-analysis. Compared with HCs, subjects with PIU showed increased spontaneous neural functional activity in the left temporal pole of the superior temporal cortex, left amygdala, bilateral median cingulate cortex, and right insula. Meanwhile, a decreased spontaneous neural activity was identified in the left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus in the subjects with PIU. These abnormal brain regions are associated with cognitive executive control and emotional regulation. The consistent changes under different functional brain imaging indicators found in our study may provide important targets for the future diagnosis and intervention of PIU. \n\n Systematic Review Registration:  , identifier: CRD42021258119. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs related industries, such as smart devices, mature, the Internet has become an essential tool for learning, working, and playing. According to Internet World Stats (IWS) ( ), as of March 2021, the number of Internet users has reached 5.17 billion, with Asia accounting for 53.4% of the world's Internet users. Such a high Internet penetration rate has brought a severe social problem, namely Pathological Internet Use (PIU). The PIU refers to an inability to control one's Internet use that adversely affects daily life, also known as \u201cInternet Addiction (IA)\u201d ( \u2013 ). The global average prevalence is about 7.02% and is still on the rise ( ). Previous studies have suggested that PIU has a similar neuropathological basis to substance addiction ( ,  ). Although more attention has been paid to PIU, the pathological mechanism of PIU is still unclear. \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) is a common neuroimaging technique to explore the neuropathological mechanism of diseases ( ). Some fMRI indicators based on whole-brain analysis, such as functional connectivity (FC), the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), functional connection density (FCD), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF), provided technical support for the comprehensive exploration of spontaneous neural activity in the brain of subjects with PIU. Previous studies have suggested that the limbic system, which is involved in the reward-processing circuit, and the prefrontal lobe, which is involved in the cognitive control circuit, are the physiological basis for the formation of PIU ( \u2013 ). However, these findings have been controversial in resting-state fMRI studies. For example, some researchers found increased spontaneous brain activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of subjects with PIU ( ), while others found a decreased neural activity in this region ( ,  ). In addition, the neural activity in superior temporal gyrus (STG) of subjects with PIU in resting-state was found to be increased ( ), while another research found it decreased ( ). The inconsistent results might be related to the differences in sample size, imaging analysis indexes, and demographic characteristics. These differences make it difficult to understand the neural mechanism of PIU, so further quantitative exploration is needed. \n\nA systematic and quantitative meta-analysis, such as signed differential mapping (SDM) analysis, can find consistent local resting-state abnormalities regardless of all method differences ( ). The SDM meta-analysis method could address heterogeneity between studies by reconstructing positive and negative graphs in the same image, thereby counterbalancing the effect of reporting findings in opposite directions ( ). This voxel-based neuroimaging meta-analysis method has been validated in psychiatric disorders, such as depression, autism, and behavioral addiction ( \u2013 ). Moreover, researchers have used this method to find consistent activation results of brain regions in subjects with PIU in task-state fMRI ( \u2013 ). However, the changes of spontaneous brain activity of PIU in the resting state remain to be explored. \n\nHence, in this study, we aimed to unearth the consistency of changes in spontaneous brain functional activity in subjects with PIU during resting state. The findings of this meta-analysis will help to understand the pathological basis of PIU and give evidence for PIU prevention and intervention in the future. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThis study was reported according to preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( ) and registered on PROSPERO (registration No: CRD42021258119). \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science (WOS) databases for publications published before July 1, 2021. The following search terms and their derivatives were used: (\u201cpathological Internet use\u201d OR \u201cproblematic Internet use\u201d OR \u201cInternet addiction\u201d OR \u201cInternet addiction disorder\u201d OR \u201cInternet use\u201d OR \u201cgaming addiction\u201d OR \u201cInternet gaming disorder\u201d OR \u201cmobile phone addiction\u201d OR \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d OR \u201cInternet dependence\u201d OR \u201cmobile phone dependence\u201d OR \u201csmartphone dependence\u201d) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cMRI\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d). In addition, we manually searched the list of references included in the study for other possible articles. The study was not restricted by country, year of publication, or publication status. \n\n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nStudies were included according to the following eligibility criteria: (i) participants were diagnosed with any of the accepted diagnostic criteria for PIU and were not limited by age, sex, or race; (ii) using resting-state fMRI technique; (iii) peer-reviewed; (iv) studies that reported standard three-dimensional spatial coordinates, such as Talairach\/Tournoux Spaces or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Spaces; (iv) fMRI studies using whole-brain analysis, including whole-brain FC, ALFF, ReHo, CBF, independent component analysis (ICA), degree centrality (DC), etc.; (v) original, cross-sectional comparative studies (subjects with PIU compared with healthy people). The following types of studies were excluded: (i) participants with other types of addictive or psychiatric disorders; (ii) literature lacking anatomical coordinates for the main results; (iii) repeated publications; (iv) studies with a sample size <15 cases. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nAccording to the literature retrieval method, the researchers (JW and QHH) independently downloaded the literature that met the requirements and removed the duplicates through Endnote software. After careful reading of the abstract and full text, studies that met the inclusion criteria were screened out. Any differences were resolved through discussion by the third (WP) researcher until a consensus was reached. After that, the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets were built to extract data from the articles. For any missing data in the article, we requested the original authors   via   email if necessary. If the study was a longitudinal study design, only baseline data were included in our analysis. Additionally, for the studies published from the same team using the same batch of data, only the latest published studies or studies with a large sample size were included. \n\nThe data we extracted from each study were as follows: (i) the characteristics of the study: first author, year of publication, and country; (ii) the characteristics of participants: sample size, age, sex, inclusion criteria, diagnostic methods used, and the severity of PIU; (iii) neuroimaging methods and results: scanner strength and brand, head coil (number of channels), the fMRI data analysis method, peak coordinates of activated brain regions, etc. \n\n\n### Assessment of Methodological Quality \n  \nThe quality of all included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) ( ). The NOS includes two types of quality evaluation lists: the case-control studies and cohort studies. Each scale contains three dimensions (selection, comparability, and outcome) and a total of 8 questions. The scale's overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with studies scoring seven or more are considered high-quality ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nBefore the SDM meta-analysis, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of all the included studies. Then, a voxel-based meta-analysis was performed on the included literature using SDM software ( ) to evaluate the differences in brain activity between participants with PIU and healthy controls. Firstly, according to the requirements of the SDM software manual ( ), the sample size, peak coordinates, corresponding   t   value of peak points, and threshold information of each study were imported into the software. For studies where statistical   t-  values were not reported, SDM provided a converter to convert statistical values such as   z   or   p-  values to   t   values. Secondly, for each study, standard Talairach maps (with both positive and negative effect sizes) of gray matter differences were recreated separately. Thirdly, random effect analysis was performed to obtain the mean maps of all studies ( ). In our study, the statistically significant threshold was set to at least 20 voxels and uncorrected   p   < 0.005. Radua et al. ( ) suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of the study results could maintain the optimal balance when the   P  -value was set at 0.005. This threshold has also been applied in previous meta-analysis studies ( ,  ). \n\nThe heterogeneity among the original studies was tested using the random-effects model of   I   statistics. When   I   statistics were 0, 25, 50, and 75%, it represented non-heterogeneity, low heterogeneity, medium heterogeneity, and high heterogeneity, respectively. Besides, meta-regression analysis was used to understand the source of heterogeneity between studies. The threshold of meta-regression analysis was set as   p   < 0.0005 and cluster size \u2265 10 voxels ( ). Additionally, to verify the stability of the results of the meta-analysis, the leave-one-out jack-knife sensitivity analysis will be used. Finally, MRIcroGL software was used to present brain clusters with significant differences in the MNI standard spatial template. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 781 articles were retrieved. After the screening procedure, 10 studies ( \u2013 ,  \u2013 ) met eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review (see  ). \n  \nA flow chart of the study selection process. \n  \n### Description of the Included Studies \n  \nAbout 306 subjects with PIU (252 males) and 314 healthy controls (HCs) (251 males) were included in the systematic review (see   for study details). The subjects with PIU were well-matched in age and gender distribution with healthy controls. All of the studies involved people under the age of 30, and five included adolescents ( ,  \u2013 ,  ). Studies included more male participants than female participants, and four included only male participants ( ,  ,  ,  ). Of the ten studies, nine were from China ( \u2013 ,  \u2013 ) and one from South Korea ( ). Ten studies comprised the following groups with PIU: internet gaming disorder (IGD) groups (  n   = 6) ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ), the internet gaming addiction (IGA) group (  n   = 1) ( ), the IA group (  n   = 2) ( ,  ), and the internet addiction disorder (IAD) group (  n   = 1) ( ). Three studies used Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) ( ,  ,  ), and five studies used the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) ( ,  ,  \u2013 ) to evaluate the severity of Internet addiction. \n  \nDemographics and clinical characteristics included in this study. \n  \n F, female; M, male; HCs, healthy controls; PIU, pathological Internet use; CIAS, Chen Internet addiction scale; IAT, young's Internet addiction test; IGD, Internet gaming disorder; IGA, internet gaming addiction; IA, internet addiction; IAD, internet addiction disorder  . \n  \n provides detailed information on the research methods used in each study. Six studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) used one diagnostic method for PIU, and three studies ( ,  ,  ) used two diagnostic methods for PIU. Notably, among the diagnostic criteria they used, the modified Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction criteria by Beard ( ) was the most widely used. All studies used a 3T MRI scanner to acquire data. There were two studies for whole-brain FC analysis ( ,  ), two studies for ReHo analysis ( ,  ), two studies for ALFF analysis ( ,  ), two studies for FCD analysis ( ,  ), one study for ICA ( ), and one study for CBF analysis ( ). \n  \nMethodological characteristics included in the study. \n  \n ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; CBF, cerebral blood flow; DSM, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; FC, functional connectivity; FCD, functional connectivity density; IGD, Internet gaming disorder; IA, internet addiction; IAD, internet addiction disorder; ICA, independent component analysis; IGA, internet gaming addiction; NOS, Newcastle-Ottawa scale; PIU, pathological Internet use; ReHo, regional homogeneity; YIAT, young's Internet addiction test  . \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment Results \n  \nThe average NOS score for the ten studies was 6.1 (see   and  ). Two case-control studies ( ,  ) were considered high quality, with NOS scores above 7. Among the remaining case-control studies, six had NOS scores of 6 ( ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ), and two had NOS scores of 5 ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Main Meta-Analysis Results \n  \nThe primary meta-analysis results were summarized in   and  . Compared with HCs, subjects with PIU had increased spontaneous neural activity in the left temporal pole of the STG (STGtp)\/left amygdala (AMY) (408 voxels, peak coordinate: \u221226, 4, \u221226), bilateral median cingulate cortex (MCC) (364 voxels, peak coordinate: 0, \u221212, 38), and right insula (IN) (21 voxels, peak coordinate: 34, \u22126, 10). Decreased spontaneous neural activity in subjects with PIU was seen in the left dorsolateral SFG (SFGdl) (30 voxels, peak coordinate: \u221228, 60, 0) and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (20 voxels, peak coordinate: 32, 58, 0). \n  \nAbnormal resting state neural activity in subjects with Pathological Internet Use (PIU) compared with healthy controls (HC) (voxels \u2265 20). \n  \n L, left; R, right; HCs, healthy controls; PIU, pathological Internet use; AMY, Amygdala; BA, Brodmann area; IN, insula; MCC, median cingulate cortex; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; MNI, Montreal neurological institute; SFGdl, dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus; STGtp, temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus; 1 voxel was 2mm \u00d7 2mm \u00d7 2mm  . \n    \nMeta-analytical results of the contrast of Pathological Internet Use (PIU) vs. healthy controls (HC).   (A)   Red regions showing significant increases in the left temporal pole of the STG (STGtp), left amygdala (AMY), bilateral median cingulate cortex (MCC), and right insula (IN).   (B)   Blue regions showing significant decreases in the left dorsolateral SFG (SFGdl) and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). \n  \nAfter SDM meta-analysis, we conducted heterogeneity analysis and meta-bias test for the statistically significant brain regions above. As shown in  , the   I   statistics of all peak coordinate brain regions were <25%, indicating a low heterogeneity. In addition, meta-bias test results showed no publication bias in each peak voxel level (  p   > 0.05). After meta-regression analysis, we found no significant influence of age and gender on the main findings. Due to the different types of other clinical variables reported in each study (such as time spent online, medication, etc.), these clinical variables were not included in the meta-regression analysis. \n\n\n### Sensitivity Analysis Results \n  \nJack-knife sensitivity analysis was to remove one study, in turn, and re-conduct mean analysis on the remaining studies to judge the stability of SDM meta-analysis results. A total of 10 mean analyses were performed in this systematic review. As shown in  , the cluster results of the four brain regions (left STGtp\/left AMY, left MCC, left SFGdl, right MFG) showed high stability. \n  \nResults of sensitivity analysis of Jack-Knife. \n  \n \u221a, the brain region was still present after the study was removed; \u00d7, the brain region was not included in the results after the study was removed; L, left; R, right; AMY, Amygdala; IN, insula; MCC, median cingulate cortex; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; SFGdl, dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus; STGtp, temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study is the first to use quantitative SDM meta-analysis to integrate abnormal neural activity in resting-state fMRI studies of subjects with PIU. We found that local neural activity of STGtp, AMY, MCC, and IN increased in the subjects with PIU, while the local neural activity of SFGdl and MFG decreased. These abnormal brain regions were closely related to the cognitive executive control and emotional regulation functions of the subjects with PIU. Our findings provided a reference for exploring the pathological mechanism of PIU. \n\nExecutive control dysfunction is a common feature in the subjects with PIU ( ). In our study, multiple brain regions are involved in the executive control function of the brain, mainly including STGtp, SFGdl, and MFG. The STGtp is an important component of the temporal lobe, located in front of STG, and participates in a variety of important cognitive functions ( ). Studies have found that the patients with cognitive impairment had reduced STG cortical thickness and increased neural activity compared with normal subjects ( \u2013 ). Besides, a recent neuroimaging meta-analysis of PIU has shown that STG was hyperactivated in the executive control tasks, suggesting that STG was involved in the executive control function of the subjects with PIU ( ). These studies suggested that increased neural activity of STGtp in the subjects with PIU in the resting state may be a compensatory mechanism for executive control function deficits in the subjects with PIU. \n\nThe SFGdl and MFG were also important to brain regions for the executive control function. These regions were located in the frontal cortex, associated with the executive control network, and regulated other cognitive functions ( \u2013 ). A previous meta-analysis found that the subjects with PIU showed abnormal frontal cortex activation in multiple cognitive tasks ( ). A recent study has revealed that the reduced SFG gray matter volume played a mediating role in the influence of emotional reflection in PIU ( ). Other studies found that abnormal activation of SFG and MFG might be involved in the control of impulsivity in the subjects with PIU ( ,  ). In our study, the decreased neural activity in SFGdl and MFG in the subjects with PIU may indicate the decreased control ability of the subjects with PIU to impulsivity. \n\nMood changes are another common complication in the subjects with PIU ( ). Our meta-analysis showed that there were brain regions associated with emotion regulation, such as the AMY. This finding is consistent with previous reports of AMY dysfunction in PIU ( ,  ), as well as with other addictions ( ,  ). The AMY is an important component of the basal ganglia and is involved in integrating and processing information about emotions and rewards ( \u2013 ). Previous studies have suggested that AMY could regulate both positive and negative emotions ( ). Subsequent studies have found the role of the central nucleus of the AMY in negative emotions accompanying reward loss ( ) and the effect of the glutamate pathway from basolateral AMY to nucleus accumbens (NAc) on controlling reward-seeking behaviors ( ). Therefore, the increase in spontaneous neural activity in AMY reflects the higher susceptibility to mood changes in the subjects with PIU and abnormalities in the reward system in the brain of the subjects with PIU. \n\nAdditionally, abnormalities in the salience network (e.g., IN, MCC) were found in the subjects with PIU. The salience network is a neural system for perceiving and responding to homeostatic demands and is closely related to diseases such as addiction and depression ( \u2013 ). The IN and cingulate are the key nodes of the Salience network ( ). Previous studies have found that subjects with PIU have increased cortical thickness in IN ( ), while decreased gray matter density in IN and MCC than HCs ( \u2013 ). These findings suggest structural abnormalities in the salience network of the subjects with PIU, which may lead to functional problems of the salience network. A recent meta-analysis of behavioral addiction has also found that neural activity in MCC increased when behavioral addicts were exposed to addiction-related cues ( ). Furthermore, neural activity in the IN significantly increased when the subjects with PIU were exposed to game cues ( ,  ). Therefore, the salience network abnormalities we found in the subjects with PIU were related to their excessive craving for addictive cues. \n\nFurthermore, our study confirmed that PIU and addiction had similar neuronal activation patterns. The results of a systematic review of addiction showed that the changes of spontaneous neural activity in frontal and temporal regions were found in both substance addiction and behavior addiction ( ,  ). These abnormal functional activity changes in brain areas were mainly related to emotion and cognitive control. This suggested that both PIU and addiction showed functional impairments in brain regions associated with cognitive and emotional processing. The difference was that the patients with substance addiction showed spontaneous changes in neural activity in the striatum in their resting state ( ). Although the striatum was also found to be involved in the processing of rewards in the subjects with PIU during task fMRI studies ( ,  ). However, in our study, no consistent neural activity was found in the striatum of the subjects with PIU in the resting state. Moreover, these findings were indirect rather than direct comparisons of neuronal activity patterns between PIU and addiction. More research is needed in the future to explore differences in neuronal activity patterns between PIU and other addictive disorders. \n\nThere are several limitations to this study. The first is that our study only included fMRI data from the whole-brain analysis, not data based on the region of interest (ROI) analysis. As different researchers choose different ROIs, this also increases the difficulty of data combination. Thus, whole-brain analysis studies avoid inconsistencies in the choices of ROI to researchers. Second, the studies we included used different analysis methods and imaging modalities. Hence, the heterogeneity due to method differences cannot be completely excluded. For example, the results of FC, FCD, and ICA analysis can reflect the connections between different brain regions or brain networks. The results of the ReHo and ALFF methods can reflect the characteristics of local neural activity in the brain ( ,  ). The CBF is the main indicator of arterial spin labeling (ASL). The ASL is also an fMRI technique, which can reflect the brain metabolism and neural activity of subjects in the resting state ( ). However, the research results of different modes and analytical methods could reflect the situation of a certain field more comprehensively. In addition, previous fMRI meta-analysis studies also combined fMRI studies with different analysis methods ( ,  ). Therefore, when the number of studies using a single analysis method is not enough, it is feasible to combine the results of fMRI studies using multiple analysis methods. Second, due to the small number of included studies, the results might be subject to random error. It is worth noting that the heterogeneity test showed low heterogeneity in the results of this study. Sensitivity analysis also suggested that the results of this study were highly reproducible. Therefore, our study could be used as a preliminary study to reflect the characteristics of spontaneous neural activity changes in the brain of the subjects with PIU in resting state. Third, PIU may have some comorbidities (such as anxiety and depression disorders) that were not considered in our study. Due to the small number of studies that we included, a subgroup analysis was not possible. Finally, the cases in our study were all Asian. Therefore, our results can only represent the neuroimaging characteristics of the subjects with PIU in Asia. We also look forward to further neuroimaging studies of PIU in more countries. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study identified consistent changes in brain regions in subjects with PIU from different fMRI studies. The subjects with PIU showed abnormal functional activity in brain regions and functional brain networks involved in cognitive executive control and emotional regulation, which constitute the core symptoms of PIU. These consistent changes in brain regions may provide important targets for the future diagnosis and intervention of PIU. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nWP, SY, HL, and TZ designed this study.

However, the results of these studies are poorly reproducible, and it is unclear whether there are common and specific neuroimaging changes. This meta-analysis study aimed to identify structural, functional, and multimodal abnormalities in CD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe PubMed database was searched for VBM and task-state fMRI studies performed in CD patients between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021, using the SEED-BASE d MAP software package to perform two independent meta-groups of functional neural activation and gray matter volume, respectively. Analysis, followed by multimodal analysis to uncover structural, functional, and multimodal abnormalities between CD and HC. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe meta-analysis included 14 CD fMRI studies (400 CD patients and 387 HCs) and 11 CD VBM studies (368 CD patients and 387 controls). Structurally, VBM analysis revealed significantly lower gray matter volumes in the right superior temporal gyrus, right insula, and right retrocentral gyrus than in the HC. On the other hand, the right inferior parietal gyrus increased in gray matter (GM) volume in CD patients. Functionally, fMRI analysis revealed activation in the right temporal pole, right insula, and right parahippocampal gyrus. In the right inferior parietal gyrus, the left inferior parietal gyrus, the left middle occipital gyrus, and the right middle frontal gyrus, the degree of activation was lower. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis showed that CD patients had significant brain GM and neural changes compared with normal controls. Furthermore, multi-domain assessments capture different aspects of neuronal alterations in CD, which may help develop effective interventions for specific functions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCocaine is an alkaloid that is produced biosynthetically by Erythroxylum coca, a shrub native to the Andean Highlands and northern parts of the Amazon in South America ( ). This psychostimulant drug has become an essential part of the world drug scene and is also the world\u2019s most trafficked drug after cannabis (resin or marijuana) ( ). The worldwide prevalence of cocaine use was estimated at 0.3\u20130.4% of the population aged 15\u201364 years (between 13 and 20 million users) ( ). Recent epidemiological data indicate that the prevalence of cocaine use is increasing ( ). \n\nAddiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by the loss of inhibitory control over drug-seeking and taking, and maintenance of drug use despite negative consequences ( ). Cocaine addiction (CD) is a worldwide public health problem, which has somatic, psychological, psychiatric, socio-economic, and judicial complications ( ). It\u2019s short half-life and strong dopaminergic precursor activity make it the most addictive of the psychostimulants ( ). Numerous studies have shown that cocaine causes irreversible structural changes in the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs such as the liver and kidneys, and that many mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of these damages ( ). Compared with the general population, cocaine use is associated with a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia ( ) and may also induce transient psychotic symptoms such as paranoid beliefs and paranoia, hallucinations, and stereotyped actions ( ). Psychosis develops during substance use and may not resolve even after withdrawal or withdrawal ( ). Stroke risk appears to be significantly increased with cocaine use ( \u2013 ). The addictive nature of this drug can cause significant acute and long-term psychological effects in humans ( ). It is worth mentioning that crack cocaine users have more family problems than other drug users, and previous research has shown that this population has higher rates of living on the streets and coming from broken homes ( ). In light of the significant prevalence and negative consequences of CD, proposed diagnostic criteria have been included in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and have been widely used to diagnose addiction and evaluate its treatment ( ). \n\nWith the development of modern imaging technology, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based morphometric analysis are widely used to study the brain characteristics of CD. However, these studies often provide inconsistent results, in part because of the differences in the methods and sample characteristics of most studies and the limited number of samples. Therefore, the persistent neurological changes associated with CD are still largely unknown. It is of great significance to conduct meta-analysis to draw a consistent conclusion. In addition to functional neurological changes, structural markers such as gray matter volume are also important because they may be relatively stable over time and can be used as the basis for functional neural activity ( ). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis is a standardized method for measuring the volume of gray matter, and has been widely used in the study of CD. Therefore, CD\u2019s VBM study can provide additional information and complement the findings of fMRI research. In previous studies using VBM gray matter (GM) volume, almost identical reductions in insular and temporal GM volume compared with controls have been reported ( \u2013 ). However, studies using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) reported more significant changes in prefrontal cortex function compared with controls ( \u2013 ). \n\nTo sum up, the purpose of this study is to explore the common GM abnormalities and functional deficits of CD individuals, which are very important for the development of specific intervention for CD or transdiagnostic treatment. We conducted two meta-analyses including all VBM and fMRI studies separately, and further performed a joint analysis between the two main meta-analyses. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that the Insula in CD subjects would develop disorder-specific GMV abnormalities. As for fMRI, we hypothesized that CD patients exhibit abnormal under activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Inclusion of Studies for Meta-Analysis \n  \nWe did our Meta-Analyses in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Systematic and comprehensive searches of VBM and fMRI studies of CD from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2021 was performed using the PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus database, combined with the following keywords: (\u201ccocaine\u201d or \u201ccocaine related disorders\u201d or \u201ccocaine addiction\u201d or \u201cCD\u201d) and (\u201cvoxel-based morphometry\u201d or \u201cVBM\u201d or \u201cgray matter\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d) and \u201cbrain.\u201d Studies were included if the following inclusion criteria were met: (1) they reported whole brain results; (2) they compared CDs and HCs; (3) they were a task-related fMRI or VBM study; (4) they provided peak coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach spaces; (5) the diagnoses of each study were based on DSM. (6) They used consistent thresholds in different regions. Studies were excluded if (1) the patient group included other diseases; (2) they did not use VBM; (3) peak coordinates were not reported; (4) only region of interest results were available; (5) inconsistent thresholds were applied in different regions. (6) they had fewer than 10 patients. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo investigators (Jinghan Dang and Qiuying Tao) independently assessed the quality of each included study using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) ( ). NOS consist of three quality parameters for cohort studies: selection, comparability, and outcome, which are assigned with a maximum of four, two, and three stars, respectively. Therefore, nine stars reflect the highest quality. Studies with more than six stars are considered high quality ( ). Any discrepancy was resolved through a joint revaluation of the original study with a third author (Xiaoyu Niu). \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nWe performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis ( ) using the anisotropic effect size version of the SDM software package (Version 5.15) for GM volumes between long-term cocaine use and healthy controls Variety. The SDM method has been well validated and described in detail in many studies. The data processing procedure is briefly summarized here ( ). For each meta-analysis, AES-SDM converted peak coordinates to Hedge\u2019s effect size and recreated voxel-level maps for each study based on an anisotropic unnormalized Gaussian kernel. Mean plots were then calculated using a random effects model, weighted to account for sample size, within-study variability, and between-study heterogeneity ( ). Here are the steps: (1)   p  -values or   z  -values in some studies need to be converted to   t  -values online ( ); (2) the peak coordinates are converted to normalized MNI space; (3) set the full width at half maximum (FWHM) to 20 mm as this will maintain a balance between sensitivity and specificity and other parameters including voxel   p   < 0.005, peak height threshold > 1 and cluster extent threshold > 10 voxels; (4) After excluding one study at a time, a jack-knife sensitivity analysis was performed by repeating the meta-analysis to verify the stability and reliability of the results. If a brain region survives most repetitions, we can conclude that the abnormality is stable ( ). (5) To check for possible publication bias, the effect size at the peak point for each significant cluster of each study was extracted and funnel plots were constructed with the standard error of the effect as the vertical axis and the effect size as the horizontal axis ( ). Additionally, Egger\u2019s test, a regression of standard normal deviation (defined as effect size divided by its standard error) on precision (defined as the inverse of the standard error of effect size), was used to quantitatively test the asymmetry of each funnel plot. A funnel plot is considered asymmetric if the intercept of the regression deviates significantly from 0 ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample Characteristics of Included Studies \n  \nAs demonstrated in  , the final dataset contains 14 fMRI contrasts covering 400 CDs and 387 HCs, and 11 VBM contrasts covering 368 CDs and 387 HCs. See   for more demographic, clinical, and other characteristics. \n  \nProcedure for including eligible studies in the meta-analysis. VBM, voxel- based morphometry; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n    \nSample characteristics of VBM and fMRI studies in CD group. \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nThe 11 studies of VBM had an average NOS score of 6.36, and the 14 studies of fMRI had an average NOS score of 6.36. They were all of high quality (NOS score \u2265 6) ( ) ( ). \n\n\n### Main Meta-Analyses for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Voxel-Based Morphometric Studies \n  \nCombining all fMRI studies, CDs showed activation in the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R), right insula (INS.R), right parahippocampal gyrus (HIP.R), and right temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus (TPOsup.R) compared to HCS. However, CDS activation was lower in the right inferior parietal gyrus (IPL.R), left inferior parietal gyrus (IPL.L), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG.L), and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L) (  and  ). \n  \nResults of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for CD. (Yellow, CD increased; Green: CD decreased). \n    \nResults of all meta-analyses. \n  \nRegarding the VBM study, CD showed significantly lower gray-matter volume in right temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus (TPOsup.R), right insula (INS.R), and right postcentral gyrus (POCG.R), compared with HC. While people with CD showed increased GM volume in right inferior parietal gyri (ILF.R) (  and  ). \n  \nResults of Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) for CD.

(violet, CD increased). \n  \n\n### Reliability Analyses \n  \nTo assess the reliability of the findings, Jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed. In major fMRI meta-analyses these results were highly reproducible, as at least 11 of the 14 combinations could be identified. For the VBM meta-analysis, changes in the right insula were preserved in all study combinations. Furthermore, the other results were remarkably robust as at least 8 of the 11 combinations were identifiable. \n\n\n### Publication Bias \n  \nEgger\u2019s tests were performed to examine potential publication bias. The results of the Egger tests were non-significant (  P   > 0.05 for all comparisons, Bonferroni corrected), suggesting that there was no publication bias. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of our meta-analysis is to explore the changes of brain GM and functional abnormalities between CD and HC. The main fMRI Meta-analysis showed that CD was related to the overactivation of ITG.R, INS.R, HIP.R, and TPOsup.R, but to the insufficient activation of IPL, MOG.L, and MFG.L. In addition, VBM meta-analysis showed that the gray matter volume of CD in TPOsup.R, INS.R, and PoCG.R decreased, while that of IPL.R increased. Through multimodal analysis, the gray matter volume of IPL.R was abnormally increased, but the function was not activated. The whole brain jack-knife sensitivity analysis of the system provides a reliable result. \n\nAccording to our results, neural changes in the right insula were present in both the main VBM and fMRI meta-analyses. Previous studies have found that the gray matter value of the insular cortex is lower in drug-dependent patients ( \u2013 ). The insula is connected to several regions of the brain, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, frontal opercular structures, lateral premotor cortex, somatosensory area, parietal lobe, superior temporal sulcus, cingulate gyrus, amygdala, peri-olfactory, and entorhinal cortex. The insula projects and provides cortical input to components of the ventral striatum, a structure that plays a major role in addiction. This structure of the ventral striatum plays a role in the formation of stimulus-drug associations ( ). Abnormal volumetric development of insular gray matter may lead to abnormal input to the ventral striatum leading to facilitation of addictive behaviors. Addiction, on the other hand, results from an imbalance between the unconscious impulse system and the conditioning system of conscious and cognitive control ( ). When the balance is disrupted, the inhibitory function does not work, which results in people being unable to help with medication ( ). Insula, the structural basis of the reflex system, which are responsible for impulsive control, decision making, and emotional regulation ( ). GM atrophy of the insula was found in our meta-analysis, which may suggest that this abnormality contributes to poor impulse control, manifested by constant drug seeking and repetitive behaviors. In a recent review, Naqvi and Bechara ( ) reviewed the existing literature on the role of the insula in drug addiction. Within their theoretical framework, it has been suggested that the insula modulates the reciprocal sensory effects of drugs, which then become available for consciousness, memory, and executive function, supporting a central role for this neural structure in addiction. Enhanced function of the insula in CD may indicate that they are accustomed to cocaine stimuli and insensitive to other conventional stimuli. Taken together, fMRI and VBM may reflect different aspects of neural alterations, with evidence focusing on the important role of the insula in CD. \n\nThe right middle frontal gyrus is less active in CD compared to HC, and the dmPFC in the supplementary motor area plays a key role in performance monitoring and cognitive control ( ) and is associated with impaired inhibitory control in addicts ( ). Our results show that attenuated PFC responses to stimuli fit the Impaired Response Inhibition and Significant Attribution (IRSA) model ( ,  ). The IRSA model argues that drug dependence is mediated by dysfunction of the ACC and PFC, which involves a marked response to drug-related reward and is attributed to a high response to drug-related reward, and a markedly high response to non-drug-related stimuli Impairment ( ), therefore, inactivation of the PFC in cocaine addicts may indicate that they are accustomed to the associated rewards brought on by cocaine and are insensitive to other non-drug rewards. Clinically, anhedonia is an important factor in cocaine relapse ( ). Recent studies have demonstrated that Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) appears to have a unique therapeutic application for directly targeting and remodeling dysfunction in brain circuits altered by chronic cocaine exposure ( ). Moreover, continuous rTMS regimen is safe and feasible in CD patients as a potential treatment ( ). Our results may provide research directions for this method of brain stimulation. \n\nAccording to the primary meta-analysis and multimodal analysis, the GM of the right inferior parietal gyrus increased but the activity decreased, and the activity of the left inferior parietal gyrus decreased. The bilateral inferior parietal lobules (IPL) mainly include the supramarginal and angular gyri. The inferior parietal lobule is a core node of the default mode network, a group of brain regions preferentially involved in mind formation ( ). These regions were strongly deactivated in the goal orientation task compared to resting or passive baselines. It is thought to be involved in internal mental states that become salient when people do not engage in external interactions ( ) and it forms the most consistent rest-state network ( ). Inactivation of the inferior parietal cortex, including bilateral AGs, is highly reliable ( ) and consistent across tasks, paradigms, subjects and studies ( ,  ). Disruptions in connections between the DMN and cortical areas involved in executive function, memory and mood may be critical to drug use, research has shown ( ). These findings suggest that CDs may lead to poor impulse control by reducing neural activity in the IPL and predispose people to some degree of addiction. As for the supramarginal gyrus, this may be an area involved in the visual memory system. In particular, these regions have been shown to be involved in the processing of visually presented stimuli and the extraction of spatial locations ( ,  ). Evidence from these studies suggests that the right inferior parietal lobe, particularly the supramarginal gyrus, appears to play a role in processing visually presented information. Importantly, visual memory ability has been shown to be associated with treatment engagement as well as substance relapse ( ). Whether the increase in GM in the inferior parietal gyrus of CD has an effect on visual memory ability can be a direction for future research. \n\nIn addition, previous studies have shown that some individuals with personality disorders, mainly those with social cognitive deficits, also have reduced temporal pole volume, such as those with cocaine-dependent personality disorders ( ). And the temporal pole with right dominance is involved in various functions of social cognitive network, mainly emotion processing, empathy, and insight, which is consistent with our results. Furthermore, the superior temporal gyrus is implicated in impulsivity and craving ( ) and is involved in the regulatory control of reward-seeking behavior ( ), an important component of the addiction process. However, the exact mechanism of temporal pole abnormalities in CD-related diseases remains to be fully explored, and more attention should be paid in future studies. \n\n### Limitation \n  \nThis meta-analysis has certain limitations. First, a method based on peak coordinates was used in this study, rather than raw statistical brain maps, so it may be difficult to detect some results with small or moderate effects. Second, the heterogeneity of VBM research methods cannot be avoided, such as differences in MRI machines, slice thicknesses, preprocessing schemes (traditional or optimized), smoothing kernel sizes, and statistical thresholds may be responsible for inconsistent results. Third, this study focuses on the findings of task-based fMRI and VBM. Although studies using other techniques (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state fMRI) may also provide valuable information on the neural mechanisms of CD, due to insufficient numbers of studies or limitations of coordinate-based methods, these Meta-analyses of modalities; therefore, future systematic reviews and meta-analyses of other modalities of CD are encouraged. Longitudinal studies could be conducted in the future to explore whether these brain regions may be potential neural targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, possibly due to the limitations of the current meta-analysis, the results of this study showed that cocaine addicts had increased GM volume in the right inferior parietal gyrus and significantly decreased GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus and right insula. There was increased activation in the right insula and right inferior temporal gyrus, and decreased activation in the bilateral inferior parietal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus. The main evidence from brain function and gray matter volume comes together, suggesting that CD is associated with core neural changes in the right inferior parietal gyrus. In the future, we hope to further study the relationship between the right insula and the right inferior parietal gyrus and cocaine dependence. Future research using multimodal, multidomain research will further demonstrate and complement our foundation. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJD and YZ designed the experiment.

{"text":"Huang, Wenjing and Pach, Daniel and Napadow, Vitaly and Park, Kyungmo and Long, Xiangyu and Neumann, Jane and Maeda, Yumi and Nierhaus, Till and Liang, Fanrong and Witt, Claudia M.\nPLoS One, 2012\n\n# Title\n\nCharacterizing Acupuncture Stimuli Using Brain Imaging with fMRI - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nThe mechanisms of action underlying acupuncture, including acupuncture point specificity, are not well understood. In the previous decade, an increasing number of studies have applied fMRI to investigate brain response to acupuncture stimulation. Our aim was to provide a systematic overview of acupuncture fMRI research considering the following aspects: 1) differences between verum and sham acupuncture, 2) differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation, 3) differences between patients and healthy volunteers, 4) differences between different acupuncture points. \n\n\n## Methodology\/Principal Findings \n  \nWe systematically searched English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese databases for literature published from the earliest available up until September 2009, without any language restrictions. We included all studies using fMRI to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the human brain (at least one group that received needle-based acupuncture). 779 papers were identified, 149 met the inclusion criteria for the descriptive analysis, and 34 were eligible for the meta-analyses. From a descriptive perspective, multiple studies reported that acupuncture modulates activity within specific brain areas, including somatosensory cortices, limbic system, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. Meta-analyses for verum acupuncture stimuli confirmed brain activity within many of the regions mentioned above. Differences between verum and sham acupuncture were noted in brain response in middle cingulate, while some heterogeneity was noted for other regions depending on how such meta-analyses were performed, such as sensorimotor cortices, limbic regions, and cerebellum. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nBrain response to acupuncture stimuli encompasses a broad network of regions consistent with not just somatosensory, but also affective and cognitive processing. While the results were heterogeneous, from a descriptive perspective most studies suggest that acupuncture can modulate the activity within specific brain areas, and the evidence based on meta-analyses confirmed some of these results. More high quality studies with more transparent methodology are needed to improve the consistency amongst different studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcupuncture is a therapy of inserting and manipulating fine filiform needles into specific body locations (acupuncture points) to treat diseases. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment that has been systematically used for over 2000 years  . Currently, acupuncture is used widely all over the world, but its biological mechanism is not well understood. From a neurophysiological aspect acupuncture can be regarded as a complex somatosensory stimulation  . Although the clinical effect of acupuncture is generally accepted for certain diagnoses  , such as knee pain, low back pain etc., there exists controversy regarding the specific effect of acupuncture, especially for the specificity of acupuncture points and meridians. In clinical studies large effects produced by sham acupuncture were observed  \u2013 . \n\nInterest in investigating acupuncture mechanisms with imaging techniques has been growing since the mid 1990 s  ,  . Positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used and, there is also interest in electro-encephalography (EEG). Functional MRI (fMRI), investigating the hemodynamic blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect, has come to dominate the brain mapping field due to its minimal invasiveness, lack of radiation exposure, excellent spatial resolution and relatively wide availability. \n\nIn the previous decade, an increasing number of studies applied fMRI to investigate acupuncture stimulation. The aim of this review was to give a systematic overview about the fMRI research on acupuncture regarding the following four aspects: 1) differences between verum and sham acupuncture, 2) differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation, 3) differences between patients and healthy volunteers, 4) differences between different acupuncture points. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe search strategy, research questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria and data extraction and analysis were predefined in our protocol. During the study, the database search was extended for the Japanese and Korean databases. \n\n### Searching \n  \nWe searched the following sources: \n\n1.PubMed (1948\u20132009.09) 2.EMBASE (1980\u20132009.09) 3.CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) (1915\u20132009.09) 4.Japanese Ichushi-Web (1983\u20132009.09) 5.Korean NDSL (National Digital Science Links) (1946\u20132009.09); KTKP (Korean Traditional Knowledge Portal) (1997\u20132008) \n\nWe searched these databases in the appropriate language using the following MeSH terms and search strategies: \n\nEnglish: 1.fMRI; 2.Functional MRI; 3.MRI, Functional; 4.Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Functional; 5.acupuncture; 6.#1 or #2 or #3 or #4; 7.#5 and #6; \n\nChinese: 1.\u9488\u523a(acupuncture); 2.\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf(Magnetic Resonance Imaging); 3.#1 and #2 \n\nJapanese: 1.1.\u937c(acupuncture); 2.\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u78c1\u6c17\u5171\u9cf4\u753b\u50cf\u6cd5 (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging); 3.#1 and #2 \n\nKorean: 1.  (fMRI, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging); 2.  (acupuncture); 3.#1 and #2 \n\nWe screened the bibliographies of identified trials and reviewed articles for further potentially relevant publications. \n\n\n### Selection \n  \nIn this review we included all studies using fMRI to investigate the effect of acupuncture on the human brain. Each study had to have at least one group, which received an intervention with any type of needle-based acupuncture. We included trials on healthy volunteers as well as patients and all types of needle acupuncture were accepted. There were no language restrictions and no limitations on outcome measures. Reviews, editorials and trials on animals were excluded. \n\nThe available abstracts of all identified references were screened and we excluded all citations that clearly did not fit the inclusion criteria. Full copies of all remaining articles and those references without available abstracts were obtained. Subsequently the three researchers (WJH: Pubmed, Embase and CNKI, KP: Korean databases, YM: Japanese databases) screened the full texts and assessed whether these trials met the inclusion criteria. \n\nIn the meta-analysis, we included studies investigating only verum acupuncture or both verum and sham acupuncture by fMRI using whole brain acquisition. Studies were excluded if 1) the number of study participants was less than five; 2) results were not reported as 3-dimensional coordinates in standard stereotactic space; 3) only the results from regions of interest (ROI) were reported or 4) only single subject data instead of group data were reported. \n\n\n### Data extraction and analysis \n  \nThe three researchers (WJH: Pubmed, Embase and CNKI, KP: Korean databases, YM: Japanese databases) extracted the data for all descriptive information from the publications, namely published journals, language, study place, study type, subjects, handedness, objective, interventions, control groups, block-design, fMRI device type, software for fMRI data analysis, sample size, and results. The extracted data were discussed with three supervisors (CW, DP and VN). Any inconsistencies were discussed and reconsidered until consensus was reached. \n\nResults were structured according to the four research questions. Studies that matched multiple research questions were displayed more than once, but only with the part of the study relevant to the respective research question. \n\nFurthermore, one figure for different acupuncture points from publications in Talairach coordinates was generated by one author (XYL) using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI,  ) and MRIcron software ( ). The anatomical image was generated using MRIcron software. \n\nThe meta-analyses were conducted (JN, XYL, WJH) in Talairach space, using the activation likelihood estimation technique (ALE) implemented in GingerALE 2.1.1 software  \u2013 . This technique assesses the convergence between activation foci from different experiments. Prior to the analysis, coordinates reported in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space were converted to Talairach anatomical space using the Lancaster transform  . For each experiment, every reported activation maximum was modeled by a 3-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution centered at the given coordinate. The width of the Gaussian probability distribution was determined individually for each experiment based on empirical estimates of between-subject variability, taking into account the number of subjects in each experiment  . Voxel-wise ALE scores were calculated from the union of the Gaussian probability distributions within and across experiments. In a random effects analysis, ALE scores were tested against a null hypothesis of random distribution across the brain, thereby identifying those regions where empirical ALE values were higher than could be expected by chance. Resulting ALE maps were thresholded at p<0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons by False Discovery Rate). The minimum cluster volume was chosen to exceed the number of voxels corresponding to 5% possible false positives. The contrast studies analysis (subtraction analysis which compares two ALE maps) was performed with randomization testing with 10,000 permutations. As there exists no correction for multiple comparison with this approach, the threshold was set at p<0.05 (uncorrected) with a min. cluster size\u200a=\u200a200 mm . \n\nALE maps were computed for the following statistical comparisons. From all studies included in the meta-analysis: 1a) greater activation of verum acupuncture points compared to baseline (verum>rest), 1b) greater deactivation of verum acupuncture points compared to baseline (rest>verum). From the studies which provided direct contrasts between verum and sham acupuncture: 2a) greater activation from verum than sham acupuncture (or greater deactivation for sham, i.e. verum>sham), 2b) greater deactivation from verum than sham acupuncture (or greater activation for sham, i.e. sham>verum). From the studies which had both verum and sham acupuncture groups: 3a) greater activation of verum acupuncture points than baseline (verum>rest), 3b) greater deactivation of verum acupuncture points than baseline (rest>verum), 3c) greater activation of sham acupuncture points than baseline (sham>rest), 3d) greater deactivation of sham acupuncture points than baseline (rest>sham), 3e) comparison ALE map of greater activation of verum than sham acupuncture relative to rest (\u201cverum>rest\u201d - \u201csham>rest\u201d), 3f) comparison ALE map of greater deactivation of verum than sham acupuncture relative to rest (\u201crest>verum\u201d - \u201crest>sham\u201d). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study characteristics \n  \nThe 149 studies were published between 1999 and 2009 (trial flow see  ),   shows the number of publications per year in corresponding countries in the last 11 years. Most of the studies were performed in China, US and Korea and predominantly published in Chinese and English (50.3% Chinese, 38.9% English, 9.4% Korean, 0.7% German and 0.7% Japanese). The median number of subjects per study was 17 (min. 1 to max. 67), and the total number of all studies included 2469 subjects. 24 studies reported parallel group randomized trials. 128 studies were on healthy volunteers, 13 studies on patients, 8 studies on the comparison of patients and healthy volunteers. Most of the trials applied a block design for fMRI data acquisition, with a time range for each block of 8 sec to 6 min, and the number of blocks ranged from one to 12 blocks. 105 studies included right-handed subjects while only 3 studies included also left-handed subjects. 34 studies were included in the meta-analyses. \n   Flow of information through the different phases of the systematic review.       Number of publications on acupuncture and fMRI identified in the last 11 years.    \n\n### Descriptive findings of differences between verum and sham acupuncture \n  \n51 publications explored four kinds of sham acupuncture including a) a placebo needle (Streitberger needle  : with a blunt tip, which when it touches the skin causes a pricking sensation for the patient, simulating the puncturing of the skin. The needle moves inside the handle, and appears to be shortened.); b) needling at non-acupuncture points in close proximity to acupuncture points; c) needling at non-acupuncture points distant to acupuncture points; d) cutaneous stimulation at the same acupuncture points or sham point\/area ( ). Two of the studies  ,   are referenced more than once in the table because of the different sham acupuncture methods evaluated in these studies. The studies included mainly healthy volunteers, but four publications  \u2013  included patients with Parkinson's disease or stroke. \n\n#### A placebo needle: Streitberger Needle \n  \nThe four studies which compared verum acupuncture with the Streitberger Needle were all from the US and showed heterogeneous results  ,  ,  ,  . Yoo et al.   found more activation associated with verum acupuncture in the somatosensory areas and motor areas. Dougherty et al.   reported that acupuncture produced more activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and more deactivation in brainstem and insula, while the Streitberger needle showed higher activation in the language area (Wernicke), pons, operculum and insula. According to Deng et al.   verum acupuncture resulted in more activation in insula and operculum compared to the Streitberger needle placed at a non-acupuncture point. A study with stroke patients   (scan during passive finger movement pre and -post 10 weeks treatment of verum acupuncture or the Streitberger placebo needle) showed a trend toward a greater maximum activation change in the motor cortical area for the verum acupuncture group. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture at non-acupuncture points in close proximity to acupuncture points \n  \nTwo third (64%)  ,  \u2013  of 25 studies showed that acupuncture treatments were associated with more activation, mainly in the somatosensory areas, motor areas, basal ganglia, cerebellum, limbic system and higher cognitive areas (e.g. prefrontal cortex). Three studies  ,  ,   showed also more deactivations in the limbic system in response to acupuncture. In contrast, one study   found greater activation in the supplementary motor area in response to sham acupuncture. Five other studies  \u2013  found no significant difference between verum and sham acupuncture. One experiment was analyzed twice  ,   and came to different results. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture at non-acupuncture points distant to acupuncture points \n  \nOf six studies, two studies  ,   showed no differences between verum and sham acupuncture. Four studies  \u2013  showed more activation associated with acupuncture in the somatosensory areas, brainstem, basal ganglia, higher cognitive areas and part of the limbic system (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens), and one study   showed more activation associated with sham acupuncture in the motor area and operculum. Verum acupuncture showed also more deactivation in part of the limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus\/cortex)  ,  . In addition, Napadow et al.   found that both verum and sham acupuncture showed linearly decreasing activation over repeated stimulus blocks in the sensorimotor areas, while verum acupuncture produced bimodal activity in a limbic midbrain region - activation in early blocks, but deactivation in later stimulus blocks. \n\n\n#### Cutaneous stimulation at the same acupuncture point or sham point\/area \n  \nThere are 18 studies (15 on healthy volunteers). Only one study   on healthy volunteers found greater activation in the somatosensory area during verum acupuncture, whereas in four studies  \u2013  somatosensory activation was greater with cutaneous stimulation. For motor areas and higher cognitive areas, five studies  ,  ,  ,  ,   showed that acupuncture was associated with more activation. For brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum and limbic system the results were complex or contradictory: in the basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum, two studies  ,   found that acupuncture was associated with more deactivation while three other studies  ,  ,   found acupuncture associated with more activation; thalamus and insula  ,  ,  ,   were activated more while hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and temporal pole  ,  ,  ,   were deactivated more by acupuncture. In addition, when eliciting deqi, Hui et al.   found extensive deactivation in the cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum, while eliciting deqi mixed with pain, activation was the predominant pattern. Five Chinese studies  \u2013  found almost no significant differences between verum and sham, though two of them found greater activation intensity in the cerebellum or parietal lobe for verum acupuncture  ,  . Among the three publications on patients, Schockert et al.   found more activation in the motor area on stroke patients during acupuncture while Li et al.   found more activation in the somatosensory and motor areas with a control, brushing stimulation on stroke patients. In patients with Parkinson's disease Chae et al.   showed that acupuncture was associated with more activation than covert cutaneous stimulation in the motor area, basal ganglia, visual and higher cognitive area; and more activation in the motor, visual, higher cognitive areas and limbic system, compared to overt cutaneous stimulation. \n\n\n\n### Descriptive findings of differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation \n  \nManipulation methods can differ in the depth of needling, forms of needle stimulation (e.g. manual versus electrical), intensity of stimulation, and stimulus timing parameters (e.g. duration, frequency, etc.). Here, we summarized the results from those studies comparing different methods of manipulation at acupuncture points in healthy volunteers (see  ). Two of the studies  ,   are displayed more than once in the table as they explored multiple comparisons. \n   Descriptive analysis of differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation.        \n#### Comparison of different needling depths \n  \nOf four studies, two studies  ,   found no significant difference between deep and superficial needling. Whereas Zhang et al.   found more activation in almost all brain areas from deep needling and Wu et al.   found more activation from superficial needling in the somatosensory area, motor area and language areas (Broca and Wernicke areas), and from deep needling more deactivation in the limbic system. \n\n\n#### Comparison of electro-acupuncture vs. manual acupuncture \n  \nOverall, the results of three studies showed that electro-acupuncture tends to produce more activation and less deactivation compared to manual acupuncture. Regarding brain activations, two studies  ,   found more activation associated with electro-acupuncture in somatosensory areas, motor area, brainstem, cingulate or insula and one study   found no significant difference. Regarding brain deactivations, two studies  ,   showed manual acupuncture was associated with more deactivation in the limbic system  , cuneus  , transverse temporal gyrus   or middle frontal gyrus  , yet two studies  ,   also showed more deactivation from electro-acupuncture in the septal area or precuneus. \n\n\n#### Comparison of different frequencies of electro-acupuncture stimulation \n  \nTwo studies compared different electro-acupuncture frequencies. Napadow et al.   found that the brainstem was more activated at 2 Hz than at 100 Hz. But Li et al.   found no significant difference between 2 Hz and 20 Hz. \n\n\n#### Comparison of different intensities of manual acupuncture stimulation \n  \nOf six studies one study   observed that a longer duration of manipulation induced more activation in the inferior frontal, temporal, parietal gyrus, occipital lobe, cerebellum or temporal pole and more deactivation in the prefrontal cortex, orbital gyrus or pons than shorter manipulation. Four studies  ,  \u2013  found more activation in the somatosensory areas, limbic system, visual, language areas or higher cognitive areas in response to stimulation compared to no stimulation. The last study   showed that stimulation which induced deqi by maximum manipulation was associated with more activation in the postcentral gyrus and the limbic system than stimulation that didn't induce deqi with minimum manipulation. \n\n\n\n### Descriptive findings of differences between patients and healthy volunteers \n  \nAll seven studies comparing healthy volunteers with patients showed that patients responded differently (See  ). According to Wang et al.   the frontal lobe was activated in stroke patients while motor areas were activated in healthy volunteers. Fu et al.   found patients with Alzheimer's disease had more activation in the cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Liu et al.   found more robust activation in the hypothalamus in heroin addicts. Wu et al.   found deactivation in primary motor cortex (M1), parahippocampal gyrus, and higher cognitive areas and more activation in the cuneus and the insula in children with spastic cerebral palsy but not in healthy children. Conversely, more activation in caudate nucleus, thalamus and cerebellum was found in healthy children. Napadow et al.   compared patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) before and after five weeks' acupuncture to healthy volunteers receiving no treatment. Following acupuncture, a significant decrease in the activation area was found in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and M1 in the CTS patients, as well as, increased separation between digit 3 and digit 2 cortical representations in SI, suggesting acupuncture-induced neuroplasticity. In addition, Napadow et al. compared manual acupuncture to cutaneous stimulation on both CTS patients and healthy volunteers. They found that CTS patients responded to verum acupuncture with less deactivation in the amygdala and greater activation in the lateral hypothalamic area  , compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, CTS patients responded to sham acupuncture with greater activation in the somatosensory areas, cognitive and affective areas. Li et al.   found that stroke patients had more activation in the SI than healthy volunteers when both groups underwent both verum and sham acupuncture. \n   Descriptive analysis of differences between patients and healthy volunteers.        \n\n### Descriptive findings of differences between different acupuncture points \n  \nThe data on acupuncture point specific changes in brain activation and deactivation are shown in  , originating from 76 publications  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013  addressing 37 acupuncture points. Acupuncture points along the 12 regular meridians and one extra meridian (Du meridian) were assessed. The data showed changes in brain activity for each individual acupuncture point from respective publications. The most studied points were LI4, ST36, PC6, LR3 and GB34. These points have a wide clinical applicability and are frequently used in clinical practice. Overall the data showed that acupuncture stimulation mainly influenced the brain activity of the somatosensory areas, motor areas, auditory areas, visual areas, cerebellum, the limbic system and higher cognitive areas. \n\nFurthermore, we generated on a descriptive level map ( ) of 18 acupuncture points from 46 publications, which reported pre-post data on Talairach coordinates. These 18 points were located along 9 meridians. The brain maps of each acupuncture point differ considerably from each other. However, the acupuncture points on the same meridian showed some similarities among the activation\/deactivation pattern. For example, the points on the stomach meridian showed activation in the supramarginal gyrus and deactivation in the posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. In addition, the vision related points GB37 and UB60 showed deactivation in the visual areas such as the cuneus. \n   Map of brain response to 18 different acupuncture points.  \nRed: activation; Blue: deactivation; Yellow: overlap. \n  \n\n### Descriptive findings of other comparisons and results \n  \nBesides our four main research questions, there are more research findings worth mentioning: comparisons between acupuncture and other stimulations; comparisons of acupuncture under different consciousness states; acupuncture at different time points; acupuncture at group of points; acupuncture effect correlated to expectation. Moreover, resting state functional connectivity was also investigated in several recently published papers. \n\n#### Acupuncture vs. visual stimulation \n  \nOf four studies, Bai et al.   compared the stimulation phase and the resting phase of acupuncture stimulation and visual stimulation and found the BOLD signal returned to near-baseline values shortly after the visual stimulus, but for acupuncture stimulation the resting phase activities might be even higher than that of the stimulation phases. Hu et al.   and Gareus et al.   had contradictory results. Surprisingly, Hu et al.   reported no significant activation in the visual cortex during visual stimulation but from acupuncture stimulation, whereas Gareus et al.   found no activation in the visual cortex during acupuncture stimulation, and activation from visual stimulation. Li et al.   found both visual stimulation and acupuncture could activate the visual cortex. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture vs. word generation paradigm \n  \nOne study from Li et al.   found acupuncture at language specific acupuncture points SJ8 and Du15 did not activate the typical language areas in the left inferior frontal cortex which were activated during a word-generation task. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture vs. finger tapping \n  \nOf three studies, both Kong et al.   and Hu et al.   found finger-tapping task can produce more reliable fMRI signal changes than that evoked by electro-acupuncture stimulation. However, Wang et al.   found no significant difference between electro-acupuncture at ST36, GB34 and a finger-tapping task. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture in different states of consciousness (awake or anesthetized) \n  \nOne study from Wang et al.   compared healthy subjects who underwent acupuncture at ST36 in two different consciousness states. The result showed activation in the awake state was greater than under anesthetic in the somatosensory area, the limbic system and basal ganglia. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture at different time points \n  \nOne study from Zeng et al.   compared acupuncture at KI3 and KI7 at two different time points \u2013 \u201copen point time\u201d and \u201cclosed point time\u201d (the open or closed time point is determined by the Chinese medicine theory \u201cZi-Wu-Liu-Zhu\u201d\u2014the body's Qi and blood circulation schedule; acupuncture at the open point time results in maximum clinical effect and vice versa)  . The result showed acupuncture at \u201copen point time\u201d was associated with more deactivation in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, cingulate cortex and cerebellum than acupuncture at the \u201cclosed point time\u201d. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture of group of points \n  \nIn 29 papers  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013  more than one acupuncture point was stimulated simultaneously. Of these groups of points, some were functional related, some were on the same meridian, some had close locations for electric stimulation, few were real acupuncture clinical formula. 15 of these 29 papers were included among our first four main questions. Overall the results of these studies were very heterogeneous and only three studies  ,  ,   reported an interaction effect between acupuncture points. \n\n\n#### Acupuncture effect correlated to expectations \n  \nThree studies by Kong et al.  \u2013  applied an expectancy model, and found positive expectation can increase acupuncture analgesia based on the objective fMRI signal changes in response to noxious stimuli. The study indicated that different mechanisms exist between acupuncture analgesia and expectancy evoked placebo analgesia. For the verum acupuncture group, there were only a few small differences (in primary motor cortex and middle frontal gyrus) between the high expectancy side and low expectancy side. However, for the sham acupuncture group, more differences were observed in contralateral operculum, ipsilateral insula, inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. So this result suggested expectancy might involve distinct mechanisms between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity modulated by acupuncture \n  \nEight studies investigated functional connectivity of resting state. One of the first such studies (Dhond et al. study  ) found that verum acupuncture, but not monofilament tapping increased resting state connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) to pain, affective and memory related regions of the brain. Verum acupuncture also increased sensorimotor network (SMN) connectivity to pain-related brain regions. Zhang et al.   and Bai et al.   found that acupuncture stimulation may induce the modulation of the \u201cacupuncture-related\u201d network, represented by significant changes of functional connectivity in several regions of the brain, such as the bilateral frontal gyrus, bilateral temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, middle occipital gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), parahippocampus, insula, tonsil, pyramis, culmen, precuneus and cuneus. Qin et al.  ,   identified an amygdala-related network during the resting state both after verum and penetrating sham acupuncture at a nearby point. Compared to sham, verum acupuncture increased the connectivity between the amygdala, the PAG (periaqueductal gray) and the insula, and decreased the connectivity between the amygdala with the middle frontal cortex, the postcentral gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Zhang et al.   compared the visual related functional networks between pre- and post- electro-acupuncture on the visual-related point GB37 and the non-visual related point KI8 and described a positive correlation between the pre-post resting states in visual networks for the GB37 group while an anti-correlation for the KI8 group. Liu et al.   found a similar result when comparing electro-acupuncture at GB37 and KI8. In addition, in a later study Liu et al.   reported that the DMN could be modulated after electro-acupuncture at the three acupuncture points (GB37, BL60 and KI8) and at a nearby sham point. As for intrinsic connectivity, the PCC and precuneus strongly interacted with other nodes during the pre- and post-stimulation states. The correlation was interrupted between the PCC\/precuneus and the ACC. The orbital prefrontal cortex negatively interacted with the left medial temporal cortex only at the acupuncture points. \n\n\n\n### Results from the ALE meta-analysis \n  \nA total of 34 studies were eligible for the inclusion criteria for the ALE meta-analyses ( ). A total of 10 meta-analyses were performed. \n   Studies included in the ALE meta-analyses.        \nThe meta-analysis for verum acupuncture stimuli on greater activation of verum acupuncture points compared to baseline (1a, verum>rest) included 36 experiments, 377 subjects and 470 foci. The result showed significant convergence in the supramarginal gyrus, secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), middle cigulate gyrus, insula, thalamus and precentral gyrus. The meta-analysis for greater deactivation of verum acupuncture points compared to baseline (1b, rest>verum) included 22 experiments, 219 subjects and 265 foci and the result revealed significant convergence in the subgenual anterior cingulate, subgenual cortex, amygdala\/hippocampal formation, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), nucleus accumbens, and PCC ( ,  ). \n   Results from the ALE meta-analyses.  \nMeta-analyses were performed to evaluate brain response to acupuncture across studies, and contrast verum and sham acupuncture. (A) Brain response to verum acupuncture demonstrated activation in sensorimotor and affective\/salience processing brain regions and deactivation in the amygdala and DMN brain regions. (B) Differences in brain response for verum and sham acupuncture from direct contrast showed significance in somatosensory areas, limbic regions, visual processing regions and cerebellum. (C) Brain response to verum and sham acupuncture individually demonstrated activation in sensorimotor and affective\/salience processing brain regions and deactivation in the amygdala and DMN brain regions associated with verum acupuncture; while sham acupuncture produced activation in somatosensory regions, affective\/salience processing regions, cerebellum and deactivation in limbic regions. (D) Differences in brain response between verum and sham acupuncture from subtraction analysis showed more activation in the sensorimotor affective\/cognitive processing brain regions and more deactivation in the amygdala\/hippocampal formation for verum acupuncture. For subfigures A\u2013C, p<0.05, cluster level FDR corrected, color bar showed ALE value; for subfigure D, p<0.05, cluster level uncorrected, color bar showed Z value. Amyg: amygdala; Ce: cerebellum; dlPFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; FG: fusiform gyrus; H: hippocampal formation; IN: insula; MCC: middle cingulate cortex; Nac: nucleus accumbens; paraHG: parahippocampal gyrus; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; preCG: precentral gyrus; pre-SMA: pre-supplementary motor area; SI: primary somatosensory cortex; SII: secondary somatosensory cortex; sgACC: subgenual anterior cingulate cortex; SMG: supramarginal gyrus; Th: thalamus; vmPFC: ventromedial prefrontal cortex. \n     Clusters showing significant convergence for verum acupuncture points (FDR pN corrected at the cluster level, p<0.05) from ALE meta-analyses.      \nFor the direct contrast of verum and sham acupuncture on greater activation from verum than sham acupuncture or greater deactivation for sham acupuncture (2a, verum>sham) we included in the meta-analysis 17 experiments, 156 subjects and 171 foci, resulting in significant convergence in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum, SI and middle cingulate gyrus. Whereas, on greater deactivation from verum than sham acupuncture or greater activation for sham (2b, sham>verum, 21 subjects, 3 experiments and 27 foci) the result showed significant convergence in supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and cuneus ( ,  ). \n   Clusters showing significant convergence for verum versus sham acupuncture (FDR pN corrected at the cluster level, p<0.05) from ALE meta-analyses.        \nThe Subtraction analysis for verum versus sham acupuncture included in the first step analyses 3a\u2013d for the pre-post contrast on verum or sham acupuncture compared to baseline ( ,  ). The analysis of greater activation of verum acupuncture than baseline (3a, verum>rest) included 234 subjects, 20 experiments and 305 foci and revealed significant convergence in middle cingulate gyrus, pre-SMA, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, SII, thalamus and insula. The analysis of greater deactivation of verum acupuncture compared to baseline (3b, rest>verum, 172 subjects, 15 experiments and 222 foci) came to the following significant convergence: subgenual anterior cingulate, amygdala\/hippocampal formation, vmPFC and PCC. Comparing results on greater activation of sham acupuncture points than baseline (3c, sham>rest) from 164 subjects, 15 experiments and 200 foci, showed significant convergence in cerebellum, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and thalamus. Including data on greater deactivation of sham acupuncture points compared to baseline (3d, rest>sham) from 50 subjects, 5 experiments and 52 foci, resulted in significant convergence in pregenual anterior cingulate, subgenual cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. \n\nFinally, in the contrast (subtraction) comparing the between-group differences for verum and sham acupuncture, significant differences between \u201cverum>rest\u201d and \u201csham>rest\u201d (3e) as well as between \u201crest>verum\u201d and \u201crest>sham\u201d (3f) were identified. The subtraction analysis for \u201cverum>rest\u201d - \u201csham>rest\u201d showed convergent activations in pre-SMA, middle cingulate gyrus, claustrum, insula, supramarginal gyrus, SII and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The subtraction analysis for \u201crest>verum\u201d - \u201crest>sham\u201d revealed convergence in amygdala\/hippocampal formation ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOverall the results indicate that studies on acupuncture neuroimaging are very heterogeneous in terms of the study question, methodology and quality, this is the case in the descriptive analysis as well as in the meta-analysis. \n\nFrom the descriptive view on the data it seems that compared to sham, verum acupuncture tended to be associated with more activation in the basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum, and insula and more deactivation was seen in the so-called \u201cdefault mode network\u201d and limbic brain areas, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus. In addition, a trend for more robust brain activation with greater intensity of acupuncture stimulation seems to be there. However, electro-acupuncture at low frequency also tended to activate a broader range of brain areas than electro-acupuncture at high frequencies. Furthermore, it looks like that patients responded to acupuncture stimulation with a more robust fMRI response compared to healthy volunteers. Acupuncture at different acupuncture points showed in the studies both similarities and differences between points. Finally, studies also suggested that acupuncture modulated the resting state connectivity within several noted networks including the default mode network, sensorimotor network, and amygdala-related network etc. \n\nFrom the meta-analyses focusing only on brain response to verum acupuncture stimuli, activation was noted in supramarginal gyrus, SII, pre-SMA, middle cigulate gyrus, insula, thalamus and precentral gyrus, while deactivation was noted in pregenual anterior cingulate, subgenual cortex, amygdala\/hippocampal formation, vmPFC, nucleus accumbens and PCC. Acupuncture specific effects were noted by meta-analyses of differences between verum and sham, which showed greater response in middle cingulate for verum compared to sham acupuncture. However, the results were variant within the different meta-analyses. The meta-analyses of direct contrast between verum and sham showed significant convergence for \u201cverum>sham\u201d in fusiform gyrus, cerebellum and SI, while for \u201csham>verum\u201d in superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and cuneus. Whereas, the subtraction meta-analyses of group-derived contrast showed greater activation from verum in pre-SMA, claustrum, insula, supramarginal gyrus, SII, dlPFC, greater deactivation from verum in amygdala\/hippocampal formation. This heterogeneity suggests that group-derived contrast for verum and sham acupuncture tended to be above threshold in consistently specific brain areas, but were not significantly different in those areas, when assessed at the single study level. \n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nTo our knowledge this is the first systematic and extensive review on fMRI and acupuncture without any language restrictions. Besides the internationally well known databases such as Pubmed and EMBASE, less well known international databases such as the Chinese CNKI, the Japanese Ichushi WEB, and the Korean NDSL and KTKP were searched and the publications found were included in this review. Therefore, this very extensive review provides a transparent and detailed overview of the current literature available. In addition we structured the publications according to the research questions, such as the differences in brain activity associated with acupuncture stimuli between patients and healthy volunteers, to provide a good overview and a strong basis for future study designs, interventions, measurement methods, and possible diagnoses. Moreover, we complemented the systematic and comprehensive literature review with several ALE meta-analyses, providing analytic results for stronger evidence that are supported statistically. However, some studies reported direct contrast between verum and sham acupuncture groups, while some others reported pre-post contrast for each group, resulting in the fact that several meta-analyses had to be performed. The studies included in the descriptive review and the meta-analyses were highly heterogeneous regarding their study design, their aims and their quality of reporting. The reasons for these heterogeneous results are numerous, such as the varying acupuncture manipulation methods, different types of control arms, different methods of acquisition and analyzing the imaging data, the mainly investigated brain regions (region of interest) and the statistical analysis. The large variability between subjects and sessions with respect to the imaging data also needs to be taken into consideration  ,  . The imprecise nomenclature   is sometimes misleading, such as activation, deactivation, changes, baseline. We did not formally assess the quality of the publications, because no valid checklist for this type of research is available, though reporting guidelines are available and should be consulted by future research publications  . A narrative review including only studies that are considered to be of high quality would have overcome this problem. However the aim of this paper was to provide a systematic and broad overview for the first time using the publications currently available. We believe that many trials included in this review have limitations regarding their study design, analysis and reporting of their results. Hence, our results have to be interpreted with care. This is underlined by the multitude of contradictory results. Lastly, the field of research on brain imaging for acupuncture is evolving rapidly which may indeed lessen the relevance of older results using sub-optimal methodologies and analysis techniques. \n\n\n### Discussion of results \n  \nThe studies on BOLD activation and deactivation from a single point or a group of points came mainly from China and Korea. The controlled studies, including sham acupuncture as a control, were mainly from China and the US: the Chinese studies mainly used penetrating sham at a nearby non-acupuncture point as a control while the US studies mainly applied the non-penetrating Streitberger needle or monofilament tapping at the same acupuncture points. Studies on patients were mainly from China. Although we did not evaluate the quality of the publications, the papers published in English used a clearer reporting style than those published in other languages. The most innovative studies came from the US. These studies had clear study questions and explored acupuncture neurocorrelates with a pain matrix, expectation, autonomic regulation, somatosensory perception and deqi related brain response. \n\nWhile in the descriptive analysis similarities were observed in the brain response to stimulation at different acupuncture points, some differences across points were also noted. For example, brain deactivation observed in the visual areas (precuneus, cuneus) appeared not only when the vision related points (GB37, UB60) were needled, but also when several non-vision related points (LR2, LR3, ST36) were needled, but not with the other points. One could argue, based on TCM theory, that for the two points on liver meridian (LR2, LR3), the liver opens into the eyes, reflecting its physiological and pathological conditions  . The stimulation of different acupoints in the same spinal segment could induce different fMRI activation patterns in the brain   while acupoints on the same meridian show some similarities in the activation\/deactivation pattern  . \n\nThe meta-analyses could only be done for publications that provided Talairach data, which was not the case for all of our study questions. The meta-analyses on the specific effect of acupuncture that compared verum and sham acupuncture came up with heterogeneous results. The subtraction analyses reflected descriptive results more than the direct contrast analyses. For example, subtraction meta-analyses confirmed more activation from verum in basal ganglia and insula, more deactivation in the limbic region of amygdala\/hippocampal formation associated with verum, while meta-analyses of direct contrast for verum and sham confirmed more activation in cerebellum associated with verum. The convergence of brain regions shown for these meta-analyses comparing verum and sham acupuncture overlapped for middle cingulate gyrus. The first reason for the heterogeneous results might be the literature heterogeneity. Only two publications had both pre-post and between-group comparison results  ,  . Also, the different methods of acupuncture stimuli may have a strong impact of the result. Moreover, the direct contrast \u201cverum>sham\u201d included either more activation from verum or more deactivation from the sham. Thus, the results of direct contrast \u201cverum>sham\u201d and subtraction analysis \u201cverum>rest\u201d \u2013 \u201csham>rest\u201d are not directly comparable. The ALE subtraction analysis for the comparison of verum versus sham acupuncture should be interpreted with caution because the groups are disparate in total number of foci. However, we refrained from randomly extracting experiments from the larger foci set  , as this might have biased our results substantially. In particular, for the \u201crest>verum\u201d \u2013 \u201crest>sham\u201d, extracting 5 experiments out of 15 from \u201crest>verum\u201d could most probably influence the result by chance. The meta-analysis of direct contrast for \u201csham>verum\u201d included only three experiments and 27 foci. Hence this analysis might be with not enough power and doesn't represent the general. Nevertheless, we could see that brain regions such as SII, insula, cingulate gyrus, amygdala\/hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortices might be important when differentiating the acupuncture specific effect from sham acupuncture. Acupuncture analgesia is considered as one of the most important indications for clinical acupuncture treatment  , and those brain regions mentioned above are associated with the pain neuromatrix and might contribute in explaining the mechanism of acupuncture specific analgesia. \n\n\n### Comparisons with other reviews \n  \nSome of the previous reviews  ,  ,  \u2013  focused on a broader topic of neuroimaging techniques including EEG, PET, SPECT or MEG. Those reviews summarized research questions underlying certain acupuncture mechanisms, such as acupuncture analgesia, acupuncture placebo effect, specificity of meridian and acupuncture points, and acupuncture modulation on brain networks. They displayed the evidence for each research question and cited the relevant literature accordingly. However, in most cases the literature search was not transparently displayed. The other reviews  \u2013  focusing on acupuncture and fMRI, had other emphases: Beissner et al.   focused on methodological problems, Cho et al.   explored neural substrates for hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and Chae et al.   reviewed traditional Korean acupuncture. The four Chinese narrative reviews on fMRI and acupuncture  \u2013  discussed several research questions on the specific effects of acupuncture, such as different acupuncture points, manipulation methods, deqi or not deqi, and sham acupuncture. Our systematic literature review aimed to display the available studies as broad as possible and should offer a better and deeper overview on this topic, thus supporting future studies. \n\n\n### Methodological consideration regarding future studies \n  \nOne of the advantages for fMRI is that there are multiple possibilities by which experiments can be designed and data analyzed, providing information on different aspects of brain physiology. However, the inherent heterogeneity can complicate subsequent reviews and meta-analyses. Certain basic guidelines on proper statistical analyses of fMRI data should be followed, such as calculating difference maps if two conditions, such as brain response to stimulation at different acupoints, are to be contrasted. Furthermore, as suggested by Poldrack et al., publications relating to fMRI investigations of acupuncture should report all pertinent information relating to both imaging and acupuncture procedures  . Important topics include design and task specification, planned group comparisons, behavioral performance metrics, imaging details, data pre-processing, intersubject registration, statistical modeling details for both the individual and group level, and statistical inference including approach to multiple comparisons correction. Adoption of these guidelines will improve manuscript reviews and shorten the time to acceptance (or rejection), as well as facilitate the inclusion of publications in future reviews and meta-analyses. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nBrain response to acupuncture stimuli encompasses a broad network of regions consistent with not just somatosensory, but also affective and cognitive processing. While published results on acupuncture and fMRI were heterogeneous, from a descriptive perspective most studies suggest that acupuncture can modulate the brain activity within specific brain areas, and the evidence based on meta-analyses confirmed part of these results. Future studies should further improve methodological aspects and reporting related to both fMRI and acupuncture, and strictly control experimental conditions for more robust inference. Specifically, direct contrast analyses should be used to contrast different stimulus conditions (e.g. verum versus sham acupuncture) when evaluating research questions concerning acupuncture specificity. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3322129,"text_md5":"8d8e9beb47de178cfec073be3205f1e5","field_positions":{"authors":[0,180],"journal":[181,189],"publication_year":[191,195],"title":[206,328],"keywords":[342,342],"abstract":[355,2616],"body":[2625,50262]},"batch":2,"pmid":22496739,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0032960","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3322129","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3322129"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3322129\">3322129<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3322129  Characterizing Acupuncture Stimuli Using Brain Imaging with fMRI - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature"}

What is more, the complexity and diversity provided by the developmental period only adds to this contention. The development of executive function plays an integral part in the expression of children's behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional capabilities. Understanding how these processes are constructed during development allows for effective measurement of EF in this population. This meta-analysis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the structure of executive function in children. A coordinate-based meta-analysis was conducted (using BrainMap GingerALE 2.3), which incorporated studies administering functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during inhibition, switching, and working memory updating tasks in typical children (aged 6\u201318 years). The neural activation common across all executive tasks was compared to that shared by tasks pertaining only to inhibition, switching or updating, which are commonly considered to be fundamental executive processes. Results support the existence of partially separable but partially overlapping inhibition, switching, and updating executive processes at a neural level, in children over 6 years. Further, the shared neural activation across all tasks (associated with a proposed \u201cunitary\u201d component of executive function) overlapped to different degrees with the activation associated with each individual executive process. These findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that one of the most influential structural models of executive functioning in adults can also be applied to children of this age. However, the findings also call for careful consideration and measurement of both specific executive processes, and unitary executive function in this population. Furthermore, a need is highlighted for a new systematic developmental model, which captures the integrative nature of executive function in children. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExecutive function (EF) is an umbrella term for a number of inter-related cognitive processes needed for purposeful, goal-orientated behavior (Anderson,  ; Lerner and Lonigan,  ). EF enables the regulation and monitoring of high level cognitive resources and is usually employed in novel situations (Shallice,  ; Stuss,  ). Cognitive processes associated with EF include planning, problem-solving, novel thinking, and the ability to adapt behavior to the changing environment (Zelazo et al.,  ; Banich,  ). Additionally, EF performance reliably predicts many intellectual and social competencies, such as school readiness (Welsh et al.,  ), early literacy, and numeracy attainment (Blair and Razza,  ), later school accomplishment (Checa and Rueda,  ) and social understanding (Riggs et al.,  ). The terms \u201cexecutive function\u201d and \u201ccognitive control\u201d are regularly used interchangeably in the literature (MacDonald,  ; Lenartowicz et al.,  ). However\u2014although our position supports this view\u2014for the purpose of clarity and because our work draws heavily on perspectives that have used the \u201cexecutive function\u201d term, in this paper this term will be used throughout. Broadly speaking, impairment in EF has been linked to behavioral problems, and is evidenced in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders including reading disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and several genetic syndromes, including for example, Prader-Willi syndrome (Booth et al.,  ; Kenworthy et al.,  ; Woodcock et al.,  ,  ; Visser et al.,  ; Danforth et al.,  ). Despite this, findings in relation to how EF may be linked to clinically relevant behavior remain largely inconsistent. The focus of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the neural structure of EF in children during typical development. Such knowledge is necessary to elucidate the executive underpinnings of clinically relevant behavior in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. \n\nThere has been much debate on how executive function is structured, for example on how far individual executive processes may reflect manifestations of a single EF capacity or of multiple component processes (Miyake et al.,  ; Best et al.,  ). However, a leading theory, known as the integrative model (Miyake et al.,  ), consolidates such unitary and dissociative views. Importantly, the processes considered in this model have been commonly discussed in the context of typical and atypical development, and roles in behavior (Harvey et al.,  ; Friedman et al.,  ; Karasinski,  ; Roelofs et al.,  ; Blair,  ). The processes are: withholding a dominant or highly practiced response [\u201cinhibition\u201d (inhibit)]; the regular monitoring and revising of working memory content [\u201cupdating\u201d (update)]; and changing flexibly between tasks and mental sets [\u201cswitching\u201d (switch)] (Nee et al.,  ). The most recent incarnation of the integrative model identifies an underlying commonality (\u201ccommon executive\u201d)\u2014assumed to contribute to all executive processes. It has been argued, to be virtually indistinguishable from inhibition\u2014alongside separable switching and updating processes, which rely on common EF and corresponding unique components (Friedman et al.,  ,  ; Miyake and Friedman,  ). \n\nCritically then, there is a currently open question about which executive processes can be viewed as truly separable, and exactly how these are related to each other. This question is fundamentally important for understanding the nature of executive dysfunction in atypically developing populations and its relationship to behavior. For example, taking switching as a purported separable executive process, it has been argued that switching specific demands, which require flexibility, oppose goal maintenance in the face of distractions, which are demands that have been attributed to common executive (Goschke,  ; Dreisbach and Goschke,  ; Blackwell et al.,  ). Indeed, individual differences in different executive processes have been associated in opposite directions, with attention problems and self-regulatory behaviors (Friedman et al.,  ,  ; Young et al.,  ). Yet much work on atypically developing populations has tended to take a perspective driven by the measures available, with relatively little attention to underlying structure. Therefore, this approach has often not allowed measure-related and process-related effects to be clearly distinguished (e.g., Van Eylen et al.,  ). Better understanding of how EF processes can be separated is thus required to drive productive research on how these processes can be impaired and the effects of such impairment. One way to further this understanding is with examination of neural constituents of EF. \n\nSince its initial description, the integrative EF model has been applied to child samples in several EF test performance based studies (Hughes,  ; Lehto et al.,  ; Davidson et al.,  ; Agostino et al.,  ; Rose et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ). Early results from both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that\u2014as in adults\u2014there are three inter-related executive processes in children aged 8\u201313 years (Lehto et al.,  ). However, in subsequent studies switching and updating have not always been distinguishable (Huizinga et al.,  ; St. Clair-Thompson and Gathercole,  ; van der Sluis et al.,  ; Wiebe et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ; Usai et al.,  ). Thus, even applying closely equivalent approaches, the question of how applicable the integrative model is to the developing brain remains to be resolved. It is important to note that these studies have applied a range of different measures to examine EF in children, which could contribute to the inconsistent findings. A neural functional approach that includes multiple measurement approaches can help to resolve this inconsistency. \n\nIn adults, attempts to examine the structure of EF in a neural context have generally provided support for the integrative model. For example, application of a computational neural network model has provided support for common EF and a switching specific process (Herd et al.,  ). Further, meta-analyses of fMRI data have discriminated patterns of activation across putatively separable executive processes (Lenartowicz et al.,  ). Yet, have still identified common activation indicative of an overarching EF network (Niendam et al.,  ). However, even in adults, attempts to examine the neural constituents of multiple executive processes in the same meta-analysis (Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Derrfuss et al.,  ) have been limited by use of a single task to tap each process. Thus, making it impossible to distinguish between EF process-related and EF task-related findings (Nee et al.,  ). \n\nIn children on the other hand, neuroimaging work has generally focused on the emergence and maturation of specific executive processes in children. The development of inhibition, switching and updating (in the broader context of WM) has been examined separately (Kwon et al.,  ; Durston et al.,  ; Morton et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; Kharitonova et al.,  ; Murphy et al.,  ). When assessed collectively, the evidence suggests that from an integrative model perspective, we might expect common executive, switching, and updating to show distinguishable developmental trajectories. Indeed, previous fMRI examinations have found age-related activation changes, pertaining to inhibition, switching and updating, respectively, during childhood and adolescence (Kwon et al.,  ; Durston et al.,  ; Morton et al.,  ). \n\nThere is a clear lack of meta-analytic investigation using neuroimaging data pertinent to EF in typical children. Many such analyses have incorporated both children and adults in a single sample and have tended to focus on clinical evaluation, particularly those relevant to ADHD, as reported in e.g., (Dickstein et al.,  ; Cortese et al.,  ; Hart et al.,  ). In addition, existing adult and\/or child fMRI meta-analyses have tended to take a process specific or task specific approach rather than attempting to address how multiple executive processes are related to one another (e.g., Criaud and Boulinguez,  ). Whole brain analyses also need to be utilized, as much of the literature considers a region of interest approach e.g., the insula (Chang et al.,  ), or right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Levy and Wagner,  ). Only one meta-analytic study, conducted by Houd\u00e9 et al. ( ), has reviewed the three executive processes considered in the integrative EF model, using fMRI data from typical children and adolescents (aged 4\u201317 years, using an age cut-off of 11.4 years, as this was the midpoint). Houd\u00e9 et al. found regions of activation similar to those reported in adult samples. Yet, the authors only examined \u201ccollective\u201d activity pertaining to inhibition, updating and switching (which from an integrative model perspective could be viewed as common EF). But did not assess activation specific to individual executive processes. Thus, the findings cannot inform on the potential applicability of the integrative EF model to children or the relative commonality vs. dissociation of individual processes. \n\nThe present study investigates the structure of EF in children and adolescents, by examining fMRI activation during EF task performance. The executive processes of interest include inhibition, updating, and switching, as emphasized by Miyake's integrative model. Further, an additional variable representing the unitary executive process (\u201ccommon executive\u201d), which amalgamates all three executive processes of interest, is considered. BrainMap GingerALE software (version 2.3) was used. In line with Miyake and Friedman's integrative model and the hierarchical model of EF development proposed by Garon et al. ( ), we hypothesize that activity relating to inhibition and common executive will largely indicate shared activation. This finding would provide support for inhibition and common executive processes being indistinguishable at a neural level. On the other hand, we hypothesize that significant non-shared activation will become apparent when common executive is compared to switching and updating, indicating the presence of switching-specific and updating-specific components of EF in children. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design \n  \nPapers relating to inhibition, switching, and updating were identified. Following this, Activation-Likelihood Estimation (ALE) maps were produced to examine the location of brain activation during inhibition, switching, and updating task engagement in the whole sample group (aged 6\u201318 years). Similarly to the study by Houd\u00e9 et al. ( ), comparable ALE maps were also created from studies comprising only children (6\u201312 years; \u201cchild\u201d group). Separate maps for each of the executive processes were created and a \u201ccommon executive\u201d map comprised shared activation across tasks tapping the individual executive processes. Areas of significant overlap and differentiation in these maps were compared to examine neural integration vs. distinction of the EF processes. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nLiterature searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO between 23rd October 2014 and 24th April 2015. Keyword searches comprised the following terms combined with AND operators: 1. fMRI OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d; 2. child ; 3. inhibition OR stroop OR \u201cflanker task\u201d OR switching OR updating etc. A full list of the terms used is reported in Table  . Multiple terms were used for each executive process of interest. Where specific EF tasks with commonly used names were identified, these names were added to the search, e.g., a study employing a Stroop task did not have to include the key word \u201cinhibition\u201d to be identified. Notably, more such specific tasks were identified for inhibition (see Table  ). Some tests sometimes labeled as EF tests\u2014such as WM span tasks\u2014measure WM capacity, which we and others consider to be the passive storage of information in short-term memory, a different construct to WM updating (Lehto,  ; Miyake et al.,  ; Chein et al.,  ). Such tests were therefore excluded from the present meta-analysis. \n  \n List of terms used in database searches  . \n  \nInitial inclusion criteria were typically developing child participants (aged 6\u201318 years) engaging with an inhibition, switching or updating task during fMRI acquisition. Consequently, 195 papers were retrieved from these searches. Typical development was defined as having had no prior diagnosis of a psychological problem. Thus, children could be deemed typically developing despite their suggested risk of a psychiatric disorder based on for example, expression of a genetic polymorphism variant or score on a clinical scale using \u201cat risk\u201d cut-offs (e.g., Mechelli et al.,  ; van 't Ent et al.,  ). Following this, authors who did not report activations in standard stereotactic coordinate space (Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute) were contacted and asked to forward coordinate activations if possible. Thus, unpublished data were included in the analysis. If appropriate data were not received by 30th April 2015, the paper was excluded. Authors were also approached if only between groups (higher-level) comparisons were reported. Or if activations isolating the executive process(es) of interest were not addressed, i.e., they had to report a contrast between an executive demand condition and a matched comparison condition that did not apply the executive demand. Further, if papers only provided activation data recorded during the pre-or post-stimuli intervals or if the contrasts were indicative of successful vs. failed responses and vice versa. Once these parameters were applied, 90 papers remained. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were excluded to prevent an activation bias (Poldrack,  ; Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). Some papers incorporated multiple experiments, either within or across the three executive processes. However, if needed, further contact with the authors was made to ensure that data from one group of participants during an EF task reported in multiple papers or at multiple time points, was not duplicated. On the other hand, if the same participants completed more than one EF task, the data from these tasks was included. Consequently, 49 papers endured, but with 53 experiments. Of these studies, six included eight datasets that have never been published before. Further to the database search, the reference lists from all applicable papers were also examined to identify potential additions to the meta-analysis, however, this resulted in no additional papers. \n\nThe final dataset included 1,177 participants with a mean sample age more than 6 years and <18 years (Table  ). The whole sample dataset incorporated 573 activation foci, and the child group incorporated 549 participants across 29 experiments, containing 317 activation foci. The cut-off for the child group was based on previous research indicating that executive processes tend to be relatively mature by the age of 12, yet not \u201cfully established\u201d (e.g., Anderson,  ). A demographic summary of each study including study name, participant age, number of participants, EF task used, stimuli, contrast and number of foci, is outlined in Table  . \n  \n List of studies included in the meta-analysis  . \n  \n Main study demographics are outlined: EF task administered, mean age (in years), sample size (n), the fMRI contrasts of interest and the number of foci of significant activation associated with the contrast  . \n\n Standard deviation is reported in brackets; r, range; congru, congruent; incongru, incongruent; GNG, Go-No\/Go; b, back (e.g., 1 b); L, letter (e.g., L2 back); C, color (e.g., C0 back); where \u201cand\u201d is reported, two separate contrasts were included in the analysis  . \n\n  For references of meta-analysis papers, see Reference Section  . \n  \n\n### Analysis \n  \n#### Activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nBrainMap GingerALE software (version 2.3) was used to perform an ALE meta-analysis. Analyses were conducted based on Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates and coordinates originally published in Talairach and Tournoux ( ) stereotactic-space were converted to MNI using the Lancaster transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ). ALE is a coordinate-based technique based on voxel-wise foci of significant activation across the included studies. Activation foci from separate studies are mapped in a common stereotactic space to highlight consistent conjunction. The ALE method calculates the number of activation peaks across each brain region and compares this to a uniform activation distribution representative of a null hypothesis (which is when there are not enough peaks in a voxel to indicate that at least one peak truly activates in that voxel; Wager et al.,  ). The activation foci are then treated as 3D Gaussian probability distributions and incorporated into a modeled activation map for each study. Data are filtered through a Gaussian kernel, which is sensitive to each study's sample size (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ). It is important to note that while the ALE method considers conjunctive activation, a study with more participants can contribute more to the overall results (Wager et al.,  ). The ALE statistic means that within a given voxel, at least one or more significantly activated peaks apply (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). In the present study, the random sampling was subjected to 5,000 iterations to compute a null distribution. This was then used to compare with voxel-wise ALE values to calculate statistical parameters (Nee et al.,  ). The ALE maps were thresholded at   p   < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate (FDR; Laird et al.,  ) and a cluster threshold of 100 mm  (Hill et al.,  ) was employed in the first-level analyses. \n\n\n#### First-level analyses \n  \nFirst-level analyses on common executive (shared activation across tasks tapping inhibition, switching, and updating executive processes; Figure  ) and each specific putative executive process (inhibition, updating, and switching) were conducted. First-level analyses describe clusters that pass the applied threshold for significant conjunctive activation across these groups of studies. These analyses were computed for both the whole sample and the child group separately. \n  \n First and second-level analysis design. (A)   First-level Common Executive (inhibit, update, switch);   (B)   First-level Common Executive (inhibit, switch);   (C)   Second-level Conjunction Analysis for Common Executive (inhibit, switch) and Updating;   (D)   Second-level Contrast Analysis for Common Executive (inhibit, switch) and Updating. N.B. There are statistical differences between   (A,C)  . \n  \n\n#### Second-level analyses \n  \nSecond-level analyses compare two first-level analyses, examining significant similarities and differences in activation. Second-level conjunctions reveal significant shared activation between two ALE maps. While second-level contrasts reveal significant non-shared activation between two ALE maps, by subtracting one ALE map from the other. To achieve these analyses whilst controlling for different sample sizes across studies, simulated data is created by pooling datasets and randomly dividing them into two groups of equal size. These groups are also equivalent to the original data sets' sizes. The ALE images from the new datasets are then compared to each other; and resultant conjunctions\/contrasts are compared to those in the true data. Following many permutations, a voxel-wise   p  -value image is created and transformed to a z score to indicate significance (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nTo examine the distinction between each executive process and common executive, the shared and non-shared activation between these processes was investigated. Since analyses pool data across studies, including the same study in common executive and process specific maps for second-level analyses, would introduce a bias toward significant conjunction. Thus, at the second level, analyses were conducted so as to prevent any individual study being included in two first level maps being compared. For example, in second-level analyses for updating and common executive, the \u201cupdating\u201d map was compared to a \u201ccommon executive (inhibit, switch)\u201d map (Figure  ). Conjunction analyses to assess activation pertaining to the executive component of the executive process of interest\u2014in this case, updating\u2014were conducted (Figure  ). As were contrast analyses which examined updating-specific activity (Figure  ). Corresponding analyses were also administered for switching and inhibition. This technical necessity is thus consistent with our theoretical stance. Here, the common executive construct is defined as a system drawn on by all other executive processes (including the three specific processes focused on here but also others that are not the present focus). Thus, we are working from the assumption that shared activation across two; or three; or more individual executive processes should be equally capable of identifying the common executive component at a neural level. \n\n\n#### Control analyses \n  \nFurther second-level analyses, which we will refer to as \u201ccontrol analyses\u201d were conducted to examine the putative similarities and differences between common executive, switching, and updating. The control analyses were designed to control for the lower number of switching studies in the data set. These conjunction and contrast analyses incorporated subsamples of common executive, which comprised inhibition, switching and updating datasets with ~58 foci each (to match the maximum number of switching foci obtained). These were then compared with subsamples of each specific executive process (again with ~58 foci each). Again, to reduce bias, each specific executive process subsample contained different studies from their comparative subsample in the common executive dataset. The foci included in each common executive dataset were chosen at random, while ensuring that approximately equal numbers of foci from each EF task were represented. Four different subsample datasets were computed for common executive and updating and thus, four control analyses were conducted. As there is only one switching dataset, we created four subsample datasets with inhibition and updating only (~58 foci each) and contrasted these with the switching dataset, resulting in four separate analyses. Thus, for the examination of updating vs. common executive activation, these control analyses included a common executive map derived from studies that included inhibition, switching, and updating tasks. The analyses therefore allowed some verification of the assumption that common executive activity can be isolated from shared activation across tasks tapping two; three or more executive processes. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Common executive and inhibition \n  \n#### First-level common executive analyses \n  \nThe first-level ALE map for common executive in the whole sample demonstrated shared activation in 29 clusters, with the largest activation in the right and left middle and superior frontal gyri and the right and left supplementary motor area. Right parietal regions, such as the supramarginal gyrus, the inferior, and superior parietal gyri including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the precuneus, and the angular gyrus, as well as the left inferior and superior parietal gyri were activated. Activation was also present in the anterior insular cortex (AIC; Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n  \n First-level analysis for common executive in the child\/adolescent group (  x   = 5,   y   = 17,   z   = 47;   x   = 113,   y   = 75,   z   = 58)  . ALE maps showing the significant activation clusters of common executive for the child\/adolescent sample (29 clusters). \n  \nThe common executive first-level ALE map for the child group showed 30 clusters, and like the child\/adolescent group, the largest cluster extended between the right and left supplementary motor area, the right and left middle cingulum, and the right and left superior and medial frontal gyri. The same right parietal regions as the whole sample were activated, as well as the right middle frontal and precentral gyri (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n  \n First-level analyses for common executive in the child group (  x   = 5,   y   = 17,   z   = 47;   x   = 113,   y   = 75,   z   = 58)  . ALE maps showing the significant brain activation for common executive in the child group (30 clusters). \n  \n\n#### First-level inhibition analyses \n  \nThe whole sample ALE map for the inhibition first-level analysis indicated 20 activation clusters, with the largest clusters residing in the right and left superior and medial frontal gyrus and right and left supplementary motor areas. Large clusters were also located in the right inferior frontal gyrus extending to the right AIC and right superior temporal pole, as well as the right parietal regions, including the IPS (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n  \n First-level analyses for inhibition (  x   = 5,   y   = 17,   z   = 47), updating (  x   = 5,   y   = 17,   z   = 47), and switching (  x   = 5,   y   = 5,   z   = 46) for the child\/adolescent group  . ALE maps reveal the significant activation clusters of Inhibition (20 clusters), updating (25 clusters), and switching (4 clusters) in the child\/adolescent group. \n  \nThe ALE inhibition first-level map for the child group revealed 18 activation clusters. The main patterns of activation were evident in the frontal areas, including the right frontal eye fields (FEF), with clusters extending from the left and right supplementary motor areas, through the left and right medial frontal gyrus, to the left and right middle cingulum (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n  \n First-level analyses for inhibition for the child group (  x   = 5,   y   = 17,   z   = 47)  . ALE maps reveal the significant activation clusters of inhibition for the child group (18 clusters). \n  \n\n#### Second-level analyses \n  \nThe conjunction analysis for common executive (update, switch) compared with inhibition revealed 10 shared clusters in the whole sample and 5 in the child group. The areas with the most significant activation in the whole sample included the left medial and superior frontal gyri; bilateral areas of the insula and parietal areas; and right sided activation in the precentral gyrus, claustrum, and precuneus. Whereas, the areas with significant activation in the child group resided bilaterally in the medial frontal gyri and right sided activation in the cingulate gyrus, claustrum, the inferior parietal lobe, and precuneus. However, the contrast analysis did not identify any significant differences for either sample. This is consistent with the view that inhibition is not separable from a common executive capacity (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Figure  , and Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Figure  ). \n\n\n\n### Common executive and updating \n  \n#### First-level updating analysis \n  \nThe first-level ALE map for updating displayed 25 clusters, with the main activation demonstrated in right and left frontal medial gyrus, including the FEF, extending to the supplementary motor areas and middle cingulum extending to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Other clusters included extensions from the right pars opercularis to the right precentral gyrus, the left and right inferior parietal lobule (with the right sided activation spreading to the supramarginal gyrus and IPS), the right and left middle frontal gyri to the superior frontal gyri and the right and left insula (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n\n\n#### Second-level analyses \n  \nExamining the common executive component of updating, the second-level conjunction analysis produced 8 clusters in the whole sample (ranging between 40 and 2,576 mm  in size). These mainly resided in the left and right superior frontal gyrus continuing to the medial frontal gyrus and extending to the right cingulum and right supplementary motor area, the left and right insula and the right inferior and superior parietal lobes (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). The second-level conjunction analysis for the child group resulted in six clusters, residing bilaterally in the medial frontal gyrus, the right cingulate gyrus, claustrum, and right parietal areas (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Figure  ). \n  \n Common executive (inhibit, switch) and updating (  x   = 47,   y   = 13,   z   = 46)  . Significant conjunction and contrast analysis results for common executive (inhibit, switch) and updating. Regions of significant conjunction (eight clusters\u2014red) and contrast (four clusters\u2014blue) are displayed. The clusters indicating non-shared activation were found when the common executive (inhibit, switch) dataset was subtracted from the updating dataset. \n  \nTo examine a putative \u201cupdating specific\u201d component of updating, the second level contrast analysis revealed four clusters (ranging between 144 and 1,136 mm ). These clusters were located in the right middle and superior frontal gyri, as well as the pars triangularis and pars opercularis in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left and right cerebellar crus I and II (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). However, the second-level contrast analysis revealed no significant clusters in the child group. \n\n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nFour second-level control analyses were conducted using foci-matched common executive and updating datasets. This provided a matched point of comparison to the switching analyses. And tested whether the pattern of significant non-shared common executive vs. updating activity exists when the common executive map includes updating tests. Two of the analyses identified contrast clusters when common executive was subtracted from updating. The first found one contrast cluster (216 mm ) extending between the right inferior and superior parietal lobe. The second found two clusters, with the largest (304 mm ) residing between the right middle frontal gyrus and the right precentral gyrus. While the smaller (104 mm ) extended between the left cerebral crus I and left cerebellar lobule VI (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Figure  ). These findings demonstrate that although the power of the analysis has been compromised, due to the lower number of foci included, updating-specific activity is still apparent. \n\n\n### Common executive and switching \n  \n#### First-level switching analysis \n  \nThe first-level analysis for switching resulted in four activation clusters. The largest cluster was located in the right postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe, with other clusters residing in the right middle cingulum extending to the ACC, the left precentral gyrus extending to the pars opercularis in the inferior frontal gyrus and the left lingual gyrus spreading to the left calcarine (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). \n\n\n#### Second-level analyses \n  \nFurthermore, to examine the putative common executive component of switching, the second-level conjunction analysis revealed one cluster (88 mm ) extending between the left precentral gyrus and the left frontal inferior operculum. To examine the putative \u201cswitching-specific\u201d component of switching, the second level contrast analysis revealed one cluster (192 mm ) in the left lingual gyrus extending to the left calcarine (Figure   and Supplementary Materials Section  ). These findings support the view that common executive and switching-specific components of switching may be separable at a neural level. Conjunction and contrast analyses were conducted for the child group, however, due to the low number of studies, no clusters pertaining to shared or non-shared activation were revealed. \n  \n Common executive (inhibit, update) and switching (  x   = \u22127,   y   = 4,   z   = 1)  . ALE maps demonstrate the significant conjunction (one cluster\u2014red) and contrast activation (one cluster\u2014green) for common executive (inhibit, update) and switching. The contrast cluster was produced when the common executive (inhibit, update) dataset was subtracted from the switching dataset. \n  \n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nFinally, four control analyses were also generated for the equivalent switching data, however, no significant differences were found in the contrast analyses. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, an ALE meta-analysis investigated overlap and differentiation in neural activation pertaining to inhibition, switching, updating and the putative unitary \u201ccommon executive\u201d capacity in children under the age of 18. Results suggest an overlapping yet distinct neural structure of executive function, as previously reported in adults (Collette et al.,  ). No inhibition-specific neural correlates unrelated to the common executive were identified in either the whole sample (child\/adolescent) or in the child only group. Further, when updating and switching were compared to the unitary common executive, shared neural activation was demonstrated, pointing toward common executive components of switching and updating. However, such comparisons also revealed non-shared neural activation linked to updating and switching, pointing toward separable updating-specific, and switching-specific entities in the whole sample. Specifically focusing on the child group relied on analyses with less power. Nevertheless, it is important that no evidence could be provided to support updating or switching-specific separable entities in the child group, despite substantial data being available to examine this possibility for updating. \n\nWhen common executive activity was isolated, it revealed significant bilateral activation in fronto-parietal areas and regions of the supplementary motor area in the whole sample group. The corresponding analysis limited to the child group demonstrated significant activity in largely the same areas. These results are in line with previous findings, which show activity in these areas during EF tasks throughout the child and adolescent years (Chambers et al.,  ). Further, activation in these regions has also been linked to conjunctive activity across inhibition, switching and updating tasks in adults aged 18\u201360 years (Niendam et al.,  ). This is consistent with the EF \u201cfronto-parietal flexible hub\u201d theory posited by Cole et al. ( ), which is based on functional neural connections engaged during EF. Previous meta-analyses assessing EF activation have also generated results indicative of shared neural activity. One such analysis, conducted by Derrfuss et al. ( ), assessed the role of the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) during switching and Stroop task performance. Both analyses showed concurrence of activation in the IFJ, yielding support for an overlap of shared resources between the two executive process paradigms. Since the IFJ is part of the fronto-cingulo-parietal network, this study provides further support for the present results. Furthermore, as the study by Derrfuss et al. examines adult data, our results suggest a similar EF structure may be apparent in children. \n\nIn the present study, common executive activity coincided with activity linked to inhibition\u2014isolated from shared activation across only inhibition tasks\u2014in both the whole sample, and the child only group. However, for activity linked to inhibition tasks, larger clusters of right parietal activity were evident in the whole sample relative to the child group. Although our analyses could not make direct statistical comparisons between the two sample groups, these findings are generally consistent with progressive age-related increases in parietal activation during inhibition engagement (Rubia et al.,  ; Neufang et al.,  ). This is also consistent with further evidence reporting a right laterality effect in adolescents compared to children (Houd\u00e9 et al.,  ). In line with the apparent similarities across common executive and inhibition related activation maps, our findings demonstrated areas of statistically significant shared activation across common executive and inhibition. Although, direct comparison between activation pertaining to inhibition and common executive has not been the focus, many previous studies have reported corresponding areas of activation for these constructs in child, adolescent and adult samples (Wager et al.,  ; Velanova et al.,  ; Niendam et al.,  ; Vara et al.,  ; Lei et al.,  ). \n\nFurther, our findings showed of no areas of statistically significant difference across common executive and inhibition in either the whole sample or the child group. This is consistent with our hypothesis and in line with the view that inhibition and common executive are indistinguishable (Friedman et al.,  ,  ; Miyake and Friedman,  ). This finding is important because it helps to reconcile some of the previous discrepant findings in the field. For example, previous research on the structure and development of EF suggests a unitary factor representing a common underlying EF process is evident during early-middle childhood. And after this time, distinct executive processes emerge (Tsujimoto et al.,  ; Shing et al.,  ; Brydges et al.,  ; Lerner and Lonigan,  ). In addition, both Zelazo's cognitive complexity and control theory (Zelazo and Frye,  ; Zelazo and Muller,  ) and Munakata's theory (Munakata,  ) describe EF changes in early childhood as possessing a unitary quality. However, in contrast, Diamond emphasizes the dissociative components of EF during development, yet, she also argues that periods of synthesis of multiple executive processes can occur during times of EF growth spurts in the preschool and early childhood years (Diamond,  ,  ). Inhibition is the factor most commonly identified in developmental EF latent variable analysis research, even in very young children, and this may be the first to develop (Garon et al.,  ). Therefore, the present findings suggest that what develops first may be the common component of EF, which is indistinguishable from inhibition during the developmental period. Executive dysfunction at an early age may thus be primarily governed by an inhibition deficit. Due to the apparent strong links with behavior problems, early intervention to improve inhibitory abilities may be key to minimizing the risk of developing clinically-relevant behaviors. \n\nIn examining common executive components of updating in children under 18 years, our findings point toward bilateral frontal, right parietal and subcortical activation. Furthermore, updating-specific activation could be distinguished from this pattern in the whole sample group. Updating-specific activity was also frontal but specifically right sided, and further included areas of activation in the cerebellum. Previous work in adults has revealed greater activation in bilateral frontal regions as well as left parietal areas, when updating was compared to switching and inhibition (Collette et al.,  ), pointing toward some correspondence across children and adults in this respect. Previous work in adults has attempted to isolate an updating-specific process from common executive at a neural level using relational analyses between indices derived from performance on cognitive tests; and functional and morphometric indices of brain networks (Reineberg et al.,  ; Smolker et al.,  ). However, relationships between individual differences in updating-specific ability and a resting state functional connectivity network were not demonstrated consistently across all of these indices. It was therefore proposed that updating-specific ability may rely more on a specific area involved in WM and less on connectivity between regions. \n\nMiyake and Friedman ( ) posited that the concept of an updating-specific process, and the abilities it taps, is less clear than the other executive processes. Yet, they have suggested \u201ceffective gating of information\u201d and \u201ccontrolled retrieval from long-term memory\u201d as integral components. This proposal is consistent with work that has examined transformation, substitution\u2014in line with Miyake's effective gating\u2014and retrieval, as updating subsidiary components (Bledowski et al.,  ; Ecker et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). This allows updating to be viewed with respect to performance on measures of WM capacity, which similarly draw on retrieval (Unsworth and Engle,  ; Ecker et al.,  ). All of the updating tasks included in the present meta-analysis (n back tasks) and the task employed by Reineberg et al. ( ) and Smolker et al. ( ) (keep track), require retrieval (Linares et al.,  ). Thus, since right prefrontal brain regions have been particularly implicated in WM capacity (Prabhakaran et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ; Repovs and Baddeley,  ), the present findings are consistent with the view that the updating specific process identified may rely heavily on neural architecture involved in WM capacity. Previous research has suggested that computerized WM training can increase WM capacity and improve use of WM in everyday life (Spencer-Smith and Klingberg,  ). However, there has been debate around whether such improvements may transfer to, for example clinical benefits in developmentally disordered populations (Melby-Lervag and Hulme,  ). Future work in this area that considers the presently suggested relationship between updating specific EF and WM capacity may be productive in informing on the scope of potential effects of WM training and their applicability to atypical child populations. \n\nThe present results also pointed toward a role of the cerebellum in updating-specific processes. Cerebellar activation has been linked to performance monitoring during task engagement. Particularly, it has been linked to post-error processing in relation to motor responses (Peterburs et al.,  ). All of the presently included updating tasks incorporated button-press responses, consistent with involvement of post-error motor response processes. Thus, it is possible that the present involvement of cerebellar activity reflects a task specific process, as have been highlighted as important factors to consider in this kind of functional neuroimaging analysis (Chein et al.,  ; Tomasino and Gremese,  ). Considering such processes, it is interesting to note that a particular role for cross-modal integration of information for WM has been highlighted (Prabhakaran et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ; Repovs and Baddeley,  ). Since the updating tasks involved in the present meta-analysis also involve integration of information across domains, one possibility that warrants further examination is the degree to which updating-specific processes may be inherently task specific. \n\nNotably, our results revealed no updating-specific activation in the child group suggesting a possible distinction between how far updating-specific neural processes can be differentiated in children under 12 years; and those under 18 years. When examining updating subcomponents, age related changes in neural activation linked to retrieval, but not substitution or transformation, have been demonstrated across children, adolescents and young adults (Linares et al.,  ). This is consistent with development in WM capacity throughout childhood and adolescence. Such development follows a linear trajectory with subtle adjustments, in particular, in increased capacity, taking place during adolescence and early adulthood (Gathercole et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ). Thus, one interesting possibility highlighted by the present findings is that as WM capacity develops over childhood, so too does the relationship between common and specific components of updating, which allows updating tasks to be performed successfully. A focus for future research may be to assess the development of both dimensions of updating during childhood. And examine if there is a temporal link between improvements in WM capacity and the advancement of the executive component of updating and updating-specific abilities. \n\nOur first-level analysis of switching related activation pointed toward involvement of right parietal-cingulo, left frontal and left occipital (lingual gyrus) regions. These findings must be treated with substantial caution due to the lack of switching data. Yet, they are consistent with previous meta-analyses examining switching-related neural activation in adults (Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Collette et al.,  ; Niendam et al.,  ) and so suggest a general correspondence between children and adults in this respect. Unfortunately due to the low number of switching studies included, a comprehensive examination of switching related activation in children under 12 years was not possible. The present evidence for both a common executive component of switching\u2014which involved left frontal activation\u2014and a switching-specific component, is consistent with previous work in adults (Herd et al.,  ; Reineberg et al.,  ; Smolker et al.,  ) and supports an integrative view of switching in children. However, previous work has pointed toward parietal involvement in a switching-specific process in adults (Collette et al.,  ; Reineberg et al.,  ). But the presently identified switching-specific activity was limited to left occipital regions (lingual gyrus). In interpreting these results, it is again important to consider the limitations of the relatively small amount of data available on switching tasks. However, since all of the presently included switching tasks relied heavily on visual stimuli, the finding is consistent with increased susceptibility to task modality being a feature of less developed cognitive processing (Fisher,  ; Irving et al.,  ). Interestingly, deficient switching demonstrated in individuals with a particular genetic neurodevelopmental disorder has been associated with greater involvement of occipital; but reduced involvement of frontal parietal brain regions in switching (Woodcock et al.,  ). Thus, an important area for future investigation will be how switching-specific processes change over the course of development. And whether the deficient switching that appears to be evidenced in several neurodevelopmental disorders (Woodcock et al.,  ; Van Eylen et al.,  ), reflects a deficiency in switching-specific processes; the common executive component of switching; or both. \n\nOverall, these findings demonstrate that the neural substrates of executive function in children are part of a superordinate EF network, mainly represented in the fronto-cingulo-parietal cortices. Yet, selective recruitment within these areas and others, such as subcortical regions, is evident when executive process-specific capacity is analyzed. These results are in line with previous meta-analytic research examining EF in adults (Collette et al.,  ; Niendam et al.,  ). \n\nNot dissimilar to other brain imaging meta-analyses, methodological considerations are evident. A limitation of the ALE method is that, with regards to statistical thresholds, inter-study differences are not accounted for- perhaps most notably, the power of each study. Further, this coordinate-based technique does not consider the extent of activation for each cluster but activation location only. Cluster based thresholding does not allow for precise spatial specificity, thus, we must be careful not to make inferences about the statistical significance of a particular location within a given cluster (Woo et al.,  ). Findings should also be regarded as a depiction of positive results, bearing in mind negative results cannot be generated (Cortese et al.,  ). \n\nIn addition, the present study did not account for task content (e.g., stimuli type- spatial, letter, number etc.; or response type- motor, verbal). Previous meta-analyses have found EF activation to be task-dependent (Kim et al.,  ). For instance, Simmonds et al. ( ) reported additional \u201ccomplexity\u201d related activation when they compared simple and complex go\/no-go tasks which varied in terms of their working memory demands. Likewise, Swick et al. ( ) acknowledged the need to consider differential processing demands elicited by executive tasks. Upon examination of the neural activation of go\/no-go and stop-signal tasks, the authors found concurrent activity for both tasks, whereas non-concurrence appeared in areas of the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, respectively. It is unfortunate that we were restricted in which tasks we could include in our analysis, as it is possible that the differential processing demands of those tasks had an influence on the patterns of activity identified. Indeed our results may indicate that activation relating to switching-specific and updating-specific abilities reflect processing demands necessary for respective task completion. Yet, since our analyses did not rely on only one particular task, the task-specific influence on our results was minimized. Nonetheless, in order to demonstrate a more complete neural picture of EF performance, future meta-analytic study should assess neural activity associated with EF task-specific components, which may in turn help to promote more effective EF measurement. \n\nA further limitation of the present study is the broad age range used in the dataset. In addition to this, as some papers included in the analysis did not report detailed age demographics (see Table  ), there may be variability in the overall age range reported. Moreover, a clear limitation is the lack of switching studies that were available for inclusion. Thus, the present results relating to switching, particularly in the higher-level comparisons with other executive processes, should be treated with caution. While there has been considerable interest in examining the neural correlates of switching using fMRI, most of these studies do not include data from typical children and\/or have not examined the contrasts appropriate for isolating the presently studied construct of switching. This may be because switching has been examined at a more sub-componential level e.g., the focus of the literature does not seem to be in examining switching   per-se   but instead how it works. Perhaps if a model of EF can be applied to children, which includes switching as a basic construct, this might facilitate more future attention on the construct of switching itself. \n\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge the assumption made in the present analyses, based on our theoretical position. That is, isolating common executive activity based on tests tapping only two putative executive processes (Figure  ), served an equivalent role to isolating such activity based on tests tapping three or more executive processes (Figure  ). We were able to test this assumption on a small scale in our control analyses of updating, which pointed toward consistency with our primary analyses. We also conducted further second-level analyses which examined the shared and non-shared activation between maps of common executive, which included all tasks pertaining to inhibition, switching and updating and one of the executive processes. These analyses assessed whether inclusion of this data would bias the patterns of overlap and distinction. As expected, results showed shared overlap when each executive process was compared to the \u201cinclusive\u201d common executive map (with more significant clusters identified than in the primary analyses reported here). But no distinct clusters in contrast analyses were found in any of the analyses (Supplementary Materials Sections  ). Thus, supporting the existence of a bias toward identification of conjunctive activation if any of the same studies are included in two maps compared in second-level analyses. These findings support our assumption. Nevertheless, the nature of the limitation itself meant that it could not be tested directly. For example, second-level comparison of a common executive map comprising inhibition, switching and updating studies; to one comprising only the inhibition and switching studies; would be biased toward identification of conjunctive activation. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings suggest that a structural model of EF\u2014proposing one common underlying, and multiple separable processes\u2014can be applied during development. However, in line with recent behavioral evidence, it does not appear that inhibition can be distinguished from the common process. And, updating and switching appear separable when considering adolescents alongside children. But, in children, these processes may not be separable. Thus, due to the complex nature of development and the changing structural climate of EF throughout childhood (Tsujimoto et al.,  ; Shing et al.,  ; Brydges et al.,  ; Lerner and Lonigan,  ; Howard et al.,  ), perhaps a new systematic developmental model is needed. The model should encourage careful measurement of common and process-specific components. Previous meta-analytic study has reported effects of task modality on EF performance in children (Booth et al.,  ). However, the influence of non-executive factors on EF performance at a neural level has not yet been investigated. As a result, future examination is warranted, which could inform on valid EF measurement. Only then, can we begin to systematically amalgamate knowledge acquired through understanding the neural infrastructure of EF in development, to behavior\u2014in particular, executive dysfunction in clinical populations. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nAll authors made substantial contributions to research design, drafting and final approval of the manuscript.

However, human neuroimaging studies have generated conflicting evidence on the basic neural representation of taste and reward responses to caloric sweeteners (sucrose and glucose), and most relevant studies have used small subject numbers. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nWe conducted a systematic review and a coordinate-based meta-analysis of studies reporting brain responses to oral sugar solutions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycINFO through October 2019 identified fMRI studies (in healthy human adults, including those with overweight or obesity) assessing differences in responses to purified sweet and nonsweet taste stimuli. Data were extracted with the primary objective of quantifying evidence for the activation of brain regions associated with caloric sweet taste sensation. We used activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis methods. We also performed multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the generality of effects. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOf 455 unique articles, 15 met the criteria for inclusion. These contributed to 2 primary meta-analyses:   1  ) sucrose (13 experiments, 179 coordinates,   n  \u00a0=\u00a0241) and   2  ) sucrose\u00a0+\u00a0glucose (16 experiments, 209 coordinates,   n  \u00a0=\u00a0262). Consistent activation was apparent in primary taste areas: insula (69.2% of studies) and opercular cortex (76.9% of studies), precentral gyri (53.9% of studies), and globus pallidus and postcentral gyrus (30.8% of studies for each). Evidence of reward activity (caudate) was seen in the primary analyses (30.8% of studies) but not in sensitivity analysis. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe confirm the importance of primary taste areas for gustatory processing in human adults. We also provide tentative evidence for reward-related caudate activity in relation to the sweet taste of caloric sugars. A number of factors affect the observation and interpretation of brain responses, including reward-related activity. Firm conclusions require confirmation with large data set studies. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIntake of free sugars is associated with increased risk of weight gain ( ,  ), and sweetness is directly related to orosensory pleasure ( ). The reward value of palatable food stimuli, such as sugars, is often proposed as an important mechanism underpinning their influence on eating behaviors and metabolic responses ( ,  ). For these reasons, considerable research has been dedicated to assessing the impact of sugars on the neural pathways that mediate reward and the role of reward-motivated eating in food choice and obesity ( ). Appetite involves the complex interplay between physiological and psychological mechanisms ( ,  ), but hedonic factors alone\u2014such as the sweet taste of energy-rich, sugar-containing foods and beverages\u2014can override any inhibitory influences, drive the desire to eat, and promote energy consumption beyond our metabolic needs ( ). \n\nTaste is a basic sense and an integral part of a gustatory system that enables the evaluation of food. Taste buds contain specialized taste receptor cells for detection of different taste qualities. Sweet taste perception is mediated by the lingual T1R3 and T1R2 taste receptors ( ). These receptors relay to the primary taste cortex, which is suggested to be located in the frontal operculum and insula in humans. The primary taste cortex is involved in the identification of taste and the perception of taste intensity ( ). It is proposed that the hedonic evaluation of taste stimuli involves a secondary, reward-related taste cortex comprising orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, and prefrontal cortices ( ,  ): fMRI studies indicate that activation in these areas correlates with the subjective pleasantness of taste ( ,  ). \n\nAlthough it is commonly understood that consuming foods high in sugars is associated with activation of the mesolimbic (midbrain and striatum) reward areas, in addition to gustatory areas ( ,  ), there is a paucity of research on basic neural representations of taste and reward responses to simple caloric sweeteners in humans. Despite this limited empirical base, some authors have argued that there are fundamental differences in the neural representation of reward between caloric and noncaloric sweeteners ( ,  ). Specifically, it has been suggested that caloric sweeteners activate the reward system, whereas noncaloric sweeteners do not ( ). \n\nWHO has produced guidelines for the reduction of sugar intake for adults and children ( ). Consequently, many food and drink products that have traditionally had high sugar content are increasingly available as low-calorie versions, formulated with noncaloric sweeteners as alternatives to sugars. Potential differences in reward responses to sugars and noncaloric sweeteners could have important implications for the sustained acceptance of reformulated food products. For example, even when formulated to achieve similar sweetness concentrations and initial acceptance, foods lower in sugars might fail to sustain consumer appeal because they may lack some intrinsic elements that give rise to reward. Unfortunately, our understanding of possible differences in reward processing of sugars and nonnutritive sweeteners is limited by the fact that different fMRI studies report heterogeneous activation foci for sweet tastes and are associated with methodological and analytical inconsistencies [e.g., variable stimulus intensities, different modes of delivery, and whole brain compared with region of interest (ROI) analyses]. Moreover, much of the published neuroimaging research uses small sample sizes (typically   n   <20), thus reducing the reliability of the data ( ). \n\nMurray et al. ( ) recommend exploration of the comparability of the pleasure and satisfaction derived from consuming original and reformulated, reduced-sugar products. Consensus on the impact of sugars on central mechanisms is required in order to determine the relative impact of noncaloric sweeteners on taste signaling and reward processing. Consequently, it is necessary to constrain analyses to the effects of the taste of sugars, independent of other orosensory factors. This goal may be addressed, despite the limitations of the existing data, through meta-analysis: By pooling data from published work on neurophysiological responses to sweet tastants, we may establish a more consistent picture of regional brain activations associated with gustatory and reward processing. \n\nThe meta-analyses reported here aimed to compare brain regions activated in response to tasting caloric sweeteners (the contrasts being brain activity during receipt of sucrose\/sugars minus brain activity during receipt of control\/tasteless solution) in healthy participants, using the published fMRI data to produce a consistent brain map of activation induced by sweet taste. The primary objective was to clarify the brain regions associated with caloric sweet taste sensation and reward. Understanding how caloric sweet taste is represented in the brain will have important implications for reformulation of high-sugar foods to have reduced energy content. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data search and extraction \n  \n#### Information sources and search strategy \n  \nThe formal search strategy consisted of systematically examining 3 electronic databases through October 2019 (MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycINFO) using the MeSH search terms fMRI AND (glucose OR sucrose OR fructose OR maltodextrin OR sucralose OR stevia OR steviol OR glycosides OR aspartame OR saccharin OR saccharine OR sugars OR sweetener). Searches were restricted to terms found in the title or abstract of the articles. No date limit was set for the searches. \n\nManual searches of the reference sections of identified articles were conducted to supplement the formal searches. Previous meta-analyses of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) on human gustatory cortex and basic taste ( ,  ) were also screened for additional articles. \n\n\n#### Article selection and extraction of data \n  \nFormal database searches were conducted by 2 authors independently (CAR and NF), as were supplementary and manual searches. Both authors were responsible for assessment of articles for inclusion, and decisions regarding article inclusion were determined by discussion. One author (CAR) extracted the relevant data, and these were cross-checked by a second author (NF). \n\n\n#### Eligibility criteria \n  \nThe criteria for inclusion were   1  ) any human fMRI studies published through October 2019;   2  ) original English language articles;   3  ) published in a peer-reviewed journal;   4  ) used pure tastants dissolved in water (not emulsions or milkshakes);   5  ) employed a contrast between a sugar\/sweetener solution and either a control solution (water or tasteless solution) or baseline activity (whereby activity in the control condition was subtracted from activity in the experimental condition; i.e., activation rather than deactivation);   6  ) coordinates were reported in the article or   in Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI ( )] or Talairach space ( ); and   7  ) data were obtained from a healthy (including overweight or obese) population (systemic disease-free). \n\n\n#### Additional handling of data \n  \nSome fMRI studies do not analyze the whole brain but rather focus on 1 or more specific, predefined ROIs. We did not exclude articles that reported ROI results, although ROI data may bias ALE meta-analyses ( ,  ). Instead, we included ROI data in supplementary analyses with the data from whole brain analyses and those using a large mask covering the gustatory cortex (for these additional analyses, see    ). However, in those instances in which both whole brain and ROI significant coordinates were reported [e.g., Nakamura et al. ( )], only the whole brain coordinates were included in our ALE meta-analysis. \n\nStudies that reported coordinates in the Talariach space ( ,  ) were converted into MNI coordinates using GingerALE (Brainmap GingerALE version 2.3.6; Research Imaging Institute;  ). \n\nOther decisions about data selection included reporting the coordinates from the fasting condition but not the satiated condition from Haase et al. ( ) due to the fasting condition arguably being more likely to report greater general reward activation ( ); reporting coordinates from the \u201cnon-diet soda drinkers\u201d rather than \u201cdiet soda drinkers\u201d in Green and Murphy ( )\u2014that is, a group that had not attained a conditioned taste preference for nonnutritive sweeteners; and reporting coordinated from \u201cyoung adults\u201d and not \u201cold adults\u201d in Jacobson et al. ( ) because taste perception may change with age ( ) and due to the other included studies in our analysis being conducted on young adults. \n\n\n#### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis \n  \nTwo primary ALE meta-analyses were conducted: one for experiments using sucrose as the sweet stimulus (as this was the case in the majority of studies) and a separate analysis for all experiments using any caloric sweeteners (this included the sucrose studies with the addition of studies conducted using glucose). See\u00a0  for data on sweetener concentrations, sweetness, intensity, and pleasantness of taste stimuli. Each of these primary analyses was repeated with the inclusion of ROI studies ( ). To be included in the sucrose-only meta-analysis, data must have been analyzed with the direct contrast between sucrose and either a control solution (water or tasteless solution) or baseline activity (experimental condition minus control condition activation). For the all-sugars meta-analysis, data had to be derived from a direct contrast between a caloric sweetener (sucrose, glucose, or fructose) and either a control solution or baseline activity (experimental condition minus control condition). For completeness, we also included descriptions of the few available studies on noncaloric sweetener in    . \n\nIn order to determine consistency in reported regions of neural activation for both analyses, we conducted coordinate-based ALE meta-analyses (single data set analysis). The analyses were performed using Brainmap GingerALE version 2.3.6. The algorithms in this software assess the spatial convergence of foci using the reported coordinates of activation peaks from the individual studies (rather than peak height\/signal intensity). These algorithms use kernel techniques for assessing spatial uncertainty around the reported peaks ( ). The overlap between kernels is calculated to determine spatial location convergence that is greater than that expected by chance. Our meta-analysis is of spatial convergence across studies using the (  x, y, z  ) coordinates from individual studies of peak activations. \n\nWe adhered to the ALE method ( ) of Eickhoff et al. ( ,  ) that uses a random effects model to assess agreement across experiments in reported coordinates. We also applied a correction devised by Turkeltaub et al. ( ) that minimizes within-experiment effects (differences in number of reported foci that are in close proximity, which affects an individual experiment's contribution to an ALE map) and within-group effects (multiple contributions from the same sample, with the same contrast within the same article). Therefore, an ALE value represents the degree of concordance in activation across independent studies. This method assigns an ALE value to each voxel (1-mm  volumes of brain tissue): ALE values increase with the number of studies that report activated peaks at a voxel or in close proximity. Thus, consistency of voxel activation across studies can be assessed. \n\nStandardized procedures for performing ALE using GingerALE are reported in the GingerALE user manual (Research Imaging Institute, 2013), and recent recommendations on methodology have been reported by Eickhoff et al. ( ). In brief, modeled activation (MA) maps were produced for each experiment using reported coordinates in MNI space. In ALE meta-analysis, each set of peak coordinates from an individual study is entered into an empty brain. The voxels within that cluster are given a value of 1, and all other voxels in the brain (\u223c100,000) are given a value of 0 ( ). The MA map consists of each of the reported coordinates from an individual study being entered, and then a smoothing procedure is performed whereby the value of 1 is smeared out to neighboring voxels using a Gaussian kernel. The degree of this smoothing out is based on the sample size. This is because smaller samples have less statistical power and a greater spatial uncertainty; therefore, smaller sample sizes lead to increases in kernel sizes ( ). \n\nEach voxel within the map has an MA score that reflects the likelihood of that location having fMRI activation ( ). The MA score is based on a 3D normal probability distribution centered on the entered coordinates ( ). Following this procedure, the individual MA maps were combined into 1 ALE map that represents the union of probabilities. An ALE value at each voxel (with coordinates   x, y, z  ) is calculated by taking the union of probabilities from individual MA maps at that voxel divided by the number (  k  ) of studies in the meta-analysis. Using this ALE map, true convergence of activation foci was then distinguished from random clustering (noise) by testing against the null hypothesis (by creating a null distribution map) that there is a random spatial association between experiments ( ). \n\nA   P   value was calculated for each voxel based on probabilities of attaining an ALE value that differed from that of the corresponding voxel on a null-distribution map, via random permutation. We used the same number of threshold permutations as those reported in Yeung et al. ( ). Thus, the   P   values in our analyses were generated by 5000 permutations ( ,  ). \n\nIn all analyses, we adhered to the recommendations of Eickhoff et al. ( ) by using a cluster-level family-wise error (few) at   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 to correct for multiple comparisons, following an initial cluster forming threshold of uncorrected   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.001. Relative to voxel-level FWE, cluster-level FWE is suggested to be more sensitive due to its superior power to voxel inference ( ,  ) while still controlling for incidental convergence. Cluster-level FWE thresholding provides an appropriate compromise between sensitivity and specificity. Multi-image analysis GUI ( ) was used to overlay ALE maps onto an anatomical image using MNI coordinates. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n shows a flow diagram indicating the study selection steps. A total of 804 articles were returned from the initial searches (PsycInfo, 151; MEDLINE, 239; Scopus, 414). Of these, 349 were duplicates and were removed in the first step. A further 405 articles were removed following the initial review of titles and abstracts. Studies excluded at this stage included those examining clinical populations (119), those using fMRI to examine other functions (107), glucose metabolism studies (52), MRI methodology articles (37), animal studies (37), review articles (20), studies employing non-fMRI techniques (9), studies employing other tastants (milkshakes, umami, grapefruit juice) (9), book chapters (8), conference proceedings (3), studies investigating ingestion rather than taste (2), a study investigating oral temperature manipulation (1), and 1 protocol article. A further 36 studies were removed following full-text review (for details, see  ). An additional 6 studies were identified via supplementary searches, leaving a total of 20 studies that met our eligibility criteria. Five of these conducted ROI analysis only and so are restricted to supplementary analysis ( ). A total of 15 studies contributed to the 2 primary analyses. \n\nThe final sample of studies in our analysis includes healthy weight, overweight, and obese participants, although as can be seen from  , samples are primarily composed of participants with a BMI (in kg\/m ) <25. Studies that focused on activation in response to milkshakes or emulsions were excluded from the reported analysis. Inclusion of such studies may yield different results compared with those reported here on pure tastants.

The results ( ,\u00a0 ) revealed 6 significant clusters. The largest of these involved the left insula and frontal operculum; however, we also saw activations in bilateral central operculum, postcentral gyus, left precentral gyrus and globus pallidus, and right frontal operculum and caudate (    and    ). \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nTo address small study bias in our main analysis, we repeated the sucrose minus control ALE analysis following the removal of studies with an   n  \u00a0<10 (   ). This revealed stability of the 6 clusters produced in the primary analysis and showed an additional cluster in the right insula (primary taste area). See   for comparison of primary and sensitivity analyses. \n\nA further sensitivity analysis was conducted to observe stability of results following the removal of a single dominant study with a large sample size (   ). This was conducted due to Eiler et al. ( ) (  N  \u00a0=\u00a074) contributing \u223c30% of the total sample size in the primary meta-analysis. After removal of data from Eiler et al. ( ), the right caudate and bilateral postcentral gyrus clusters were no longer significant ( ). \n\nThese sensitivity analyses were supplemented by an additional 12 \u201cleave one out\u201d analyses, whereby the primary analysis was rerun, each time excluding a different single study. These analyses did not contribute any additional information to the reported sensitivity analysis. \n\n\n### Significant ALE clusters for the sucrose minus control and glucose minus control contrast studies combined \n  \nIn addition to the sucrose-only analysis (sucrose minus control contrast), we added the experiments that provided coordinates for glucose minus control contrasts. Included in this analysis were 15 studies (contributing 16 experiments) with a total of 262 participants and 209 reported foci. The analysis pooled data from the 13 eligible experiments analyzed in the sucrose minus control contrast, plus a further 3 experiments using glucose minus control contrasts ( ,  ) (   ). Together, the ALE from these 16 experiments produced 5 significant clusters ( ,\u00a0 ,    ). These clusters related to right central operculum, anterior insula and frontal operculum, left central operculum and anterior insula, right caudate, left globus pallidus and mid-insula, and left central operculum and precentral gyrus. \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe 3 glucose minus control contrast studies had small samples (  n  \u00a0<10). Thus, the results of an analysis after removal of small sample studies are the same as those reported in the sucrose sensitivity analysis for small sample bias. However, following removal of Eiler et al. ( ), there were 4 significant clusters. Importantly, caudate and left globus pallidus were no longer significant clusters ( ,    ). \n  \nLocations (MNI) of significant clusters from the contrast sucrose minus control from an ALE meta-analysis of sweet taste in human adults \n    \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current meta-analyses found that the brain regions most consistently activated in response to tasting caloric sweeteners were in the primary taste areas of the mid-insula, anterior insula, frontal operculum, central operculum, precentral gyri, and thalamus. The mid-insula is frequently cited as being a primary region of the human taste cortex ( ,  ,  ). The anterior insula is also a primary cortical taste region that integrates information about different tastes, as well as information about the texture and temperature of oral stimuli ( ). Similarly, the operculum is an important region for conscious taste perception that has projections from the tongue in primates ( ,  ), and its activation has been reported in previous fMRI meta-analyses of basic taste responses ( ,  ), as well as in other neuroimaging modalities [e.g., gustatory evoked potentials ( )]. The precentral gyrus is often argued to be an important area of the brain for taste projection: Lesions in this region are associated with taste deficits, both in humans and in primates ( ), and surgical ablation of this area can suppress gustatory hallucinations in epileptics ( ). The thalamus is also integral to processing of taste intensity, with an fMRI study suggesting that varying (salt) taste intensity modulates effective connectivity from the insula to the thalamus in humans ( ). \n\nIn each of our main analyses we observed activity in the caudate, a structure of the dorsal striatum that has a role in reward\/salience orientation ( ,  ). Although signifying reward responses to sugars, it is important to note that this activation derives predominantly from the data of a single study. The caudate cluster was the smallest and third smallest cluster, respectively, in our 2 primary analyses. Crucially, activation of the caudate was no longer evident in our sensitivity analyses following the exclusion of the most dominant, large-sample study of Eiler et al. ( ). Furthermore, in none of our analyses was there evidence of consistent orbitofrontal cortex activity, an area of the secondary taste cortex suggested to be involved in reward processing ( ,  ,  ). \n  \nLocations (MNI) of significant clusters from the contrasts sucrose minus control and glucose minus control from an ALE meta-analysis of sweet taste in human adults \n    \nIt is apparent, therefore, that the data from the majority of studies analyzed provide limited evidence of sweet taste-induced reward-related activation, and observation of the expected regional reward activation in our meta-analyses depended on the inclusion of a single, large sample study ( ). Consequently, it may be premature to draw strong conclusions regarding a hedonic brain response to caloric sweetness within the existing database. This weakness reflects the predominance of underpowered studies in this field, and it demonstrates that more large-sample experiments are essential if we are to further our understanding of sweet taste-reward processing. \n\nAlthough several articles have reported increased mesolimbic reward area activation to caloric sweet taste (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), it may not be surprising that our sensitivity analysis de-emphasized these areas. There could be several reasons for this; as previously indicated, our findings reflect the predominantly small sample sizes of the individual experiments included in the ALE. However, there are also several sources of heterogeneity across the studies included\u2014for example, variation in the data analytic methodologies adopted by the original studies. Furthermore, there are specific limitations on our interpretation that derive from the heterogeneous design of the different experiments. For example, there is considerable heterogeneity in the concentration of sucrose stimuli administered across studies, ranging from sapid to insipid. In addition, critical to any examination of reward-related activation, subjective ratings of the pleasantness of test solutions that would establish their rewarding nature are often not reported or measured. Similarly, the specific mode of stimulus delivery varies across experiments\u2014and is not described in some reports. The populations across the included studies were also heterogeneous\u2014for example, European ( ), American ( ), and Asian ( ). It is possible that neural responses to sugars may be heterogeneous across regional and ethnic populations. It may be appropriate to describe the results of our analysis as reflecting the lack of consistency and large heterogeneity in patterns of reward response across studies. \n\nThe mode of administration of taste stimuli in the studies that we assessed ( ) may be particularly critical in explaining inconsistent reward responses. For example, delivery of small volumes of taste solutions into the mouth while participants are lying down, along with specific measures to avoid muscular artifacts from tongue movement or swallowing, may restrict the ecological validity of many experiments. Direct, carefully controlled application of small volumes of sweet solutions to the tongue may inadequately model the usual oral experience of tasting and hedonic evaluation. Such experimental controls could unintentionally interfere with the full complement of behavioral components that may be necessary for the normal experience of pleasure and, consequently, the ability to detect activation of brain reward regions. Perhaps reward-related activations would be more reliably obtained with sweet tastes that are presented in a vehicle that better simulates the more usual properties of ingesta and experience of tasting. Indeed, reward area activation has been detected in studies with sweet milkshakes containing both fat and sugar, with the fat providing texture and mouthfeel that might support hedonic evaluation ( ,  ). In addition, similar elicited brain responses were detected for both sugar- and artificially sweetened yogurt drinks ( ). The neural response to fat and sugar mixes is therefore a recommendation for future meta-analyses. \n\nFindings from studies with more complex stimuli perhaps reflect the importance of orosensory stimuli beyond mere taste in the activation of reward systems. Although many taste neurons have been identified in the orbitofrontal cortex of primates ( ), there are also other aspects of orosensory experience represented there, such as texture ( ) and olfactory stimuli ( ). Possibly, activation of a combination of these sensory aspects is required to produce the full neural representation of pleasure, with the processing of multiple sensory inputs and supra-additive activity in specific brain regions being necessary to experience the pleasantness of food ( ). \n  \nSummary of mode of delivery of oral solutions from studies included in the ALE meta-analyses of sweet taste in human adults \n    \n### Strengths and limitations of this review \n  \nA strength of the current analysis was the stringent, well-defined, and transparent inclusion and exclusion criteria, which enabled an unbiased assessment of the effects of caloric sweeteners based on the totality of directly relevant evidence. However, the literature provided only 5 studies reporting a contrast between a noncaloric sweetener and control solution, so it was not possible to conduct ALE for responses to noncaloric stimuli, alone or in comparison against activation by sugars. \n\nOur sensitivity analysis suggests that reward activity in response to the taste of sugars may be reliably revealed only by having much larger data sets than those presented in the majority of reported studies. Similarly, the putative notion of distinctions between the capacity of caloric and noncaloric sweeteners to activate reward regions may be clarified with more, higher powered experiments. Certainly, given the outcome of our sensitivity analyses in relation to sugar experiments, and the restricted number of studies, any definitive consensus on fundamental differences in reward processing between caloric and noncaloric sweeteners is premature, if not unwarranted by the current evidence (available data on noncaloric sweeteners are summarized in  ). \n\nAnother limitation of meta-analysis is the role of publication bias. Excess reporting of positive findings is known bias in the neuroimaging literature ( ). This has several potential sources, such as underreporting of null results, manipulation of thresholds to be more lenient, and ROI analyses. The ROI approach in particular can add publication bias because it allows maximization of finding differences by focusing on brain regions selected a priori (when a strong hypothesis is present) ( ). Focusing on a smaller area reduces the number of voxels that are corrected for and thus improves\/inflates the possibility of finding a significant result. The caveat to this is that ROI analyses reduce the chance of producing type II error associated with whole brain voxel correction methods. For these reasons, ROI studies are a known bias for ALE meta-analyses techniques, and as such we have sought to reduce this type of bias from our analysis by including only whole brain studies (see     for analysis including ROI studies). Nevertheless, there remains the possibility that there are studies that have never been published which could have influenced the findings of the current analysis. \n\nIn addition, there are fundamental differences between coordinate-based meta-analytic techniques (e.g., ALE) and traditional effect size-based meta-analytic techniques, namely that coordinate-based meta-analytic techniques use reported coordinates of activation peaks from individual studies. In this way, ALE provides a measure of activation location consistency. Although this is the most appropriate meta-analytic technique for fMRI data ( ), it does not provide an effect size of the activations, which would give a usual indication of clinical relevance. For the same reason, this method also does not allow for funnel plots, which provide a method for eyeballing publication bias in a typical meta-analysis. \n\nFinally, a problem for all experiments in this area is the assumed necessity to control for motor responses that might be engendered by the delivery of the tastants. It has been suggested that areas of the insula, thalamus, and precentral gyrus are activated in response to movement ( ), which may partly explain some of the activation in these areas detected in the current analyses. \n\nMethodological inconsistencies, including potentially inappropriate choice of stimuli and the absence of definitive subjective measures of pleasantness, represent real obstacles to interpretation of reward-related effects of sweet taste. Another factor may be that sugar stimuli experienced in a scanner, using typically constrained modes of delivery, do not provide a sufficient proxy for normal consummatory experience. It could be that it is the ingestive experience as a whole\u2014combining multiple sensory and behavioral factors\u2014that gives rise to orosensory pleasure, rather than the mere perception of a single taste constituent. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nUsing ALE, we have mapped cerebral activations in response to the taste of caloric sweeteners (sucrose and glucose), which primarily recruit the insula, operculum, pre- and postcentral gyrus, and thalamus. We have confirmed the importance of these brain regions for gustatory processing and have provided coordinates in MNI space that may be used for comparison in much needed future studies to define neural responses to sugars and, particularly, noncaloric sweeteners. In accord with previous gustatory ALE analyses, we also recognize the recruitment of a wide cortical network for the processing of sweet taste. Our data should aid the future construction of the necessary consensus on the relative impact of sugars and sweeteners on central taste and reward mechanisms ( ) and also support the determination of how behavioral responses to caloric and perhaps noncaloric sweet tastes are underpinned by gustatory-reward network connectivity. \n\nWe also report tentative evidence for reward activity in relation to the sweet taste of sugars, with caudate activity being present in our main analyses, but with the caveat that this activity was not confirmed with sensitivity analysis, indicating that reliable effects may be obtained only by having larger data sets such as that reported by Eiler et al. ( ). In this light, and with regard to the very limited body of fMRI data, we conclude that it is imperative that more rigorous, higher powered studies be conducted to confirm activation of brain reward regions by sugars. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7269728,"text_md5":"c15f69e28d726963530150621ad61026","field_positions":{"authors":[0,111],"journal":[112,118],"publication_year":[120,124],"title":[135,246],"keywords":[260,305],"abstract":[318,2477],"body":[2486,35460]},"batch":2,"pmid":32271923,"doi":"10.1093\/jn\/nxaa071","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7269728","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7269728"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7269728\">7269728<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7269728  A Systematic Review and Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies on Sweet Taste in Humans"}
{"text":"Boccia, Maddalena and Piccardi, Laura and Cordellieri, Pierluigi and Guariglia, Cecilia and Giannini, Anna Maria\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2015\n\n# Title\n\nEMDR therapy for PTSD after motor vehicle accidents: meta-analytic evidence for specific treatment\n\n# Keywords\n\nroad traffic accident\nALE meta-analysis\nacute psychological distress\ntraumatic single event\npost-traumatic stress disorders\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nMotor vehicle accident (MVA) victims may suffer both acute and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). With PTSD affecting social, interpersonal and occupational functioning, clinicians as well as the National Institute of Health are very interested in identifying the most effective psychological treatment to reduce PTSD. From research findings, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is considered as one of the effective treatment of PTSD. In this paper, we present the results of a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on PTSD after MVA through activation likelihood estimation. We found that PTSD following MVA is characterized by neural modifications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cerebral structure involved in fear-conditioning mechanisms. Basing on previous findings in both humans and animals, which demonstrate that desensitization techniques and extinction protocols act on the limbic system, the effectiveness of EMDR and of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) may be related to the fact that during these therapies the ACC is stimulated by desensitization. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTraumatic events (including not only large-scale disasters but also common day-to-day events, such as Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are an important cause of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders. Harvey and Bryant ( ) reports the presence of acute stress disorders (ASD) in 13% of MVA survivors, and according to Mayou et al. ( ) one year after a MVA a quarter of those followed up showed psychiatric disorders, with 11% affected by post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). \n\nPTSD is a relatively common psychiatric disorder occurring as a consequence of a major traumatic event. It is clinically characterized by the following symptoms: involuntarily re-experiencing phenomena (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive images as well as recurrent distressing thoughts of the event); avoidance of talking about or being reminded of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, difficulty in concentrating, increased irritability and hypervigilance) (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association,  ,  ). \n\nDifferent types of psychological therapies have been proposed in the treatment of PTSD, including exposure therapy (Creamer et al.,  ), cognitive therapy (Resick and Schnicke,  ; Ehlers et al.,  ), psychodynamic psychotherapy (Brom et al.,  ) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro,  ). EMDR is currently an effective psychological treatment, recognized and recommended as a firstline treatment for trauma in numerous international guidelines (Bisson and Andrew,  ). According to the review by Ponniah and Hollon ( ) EMDR ameliorates PTSD symptoms significantly more than waiting list, standard care, and pill placebo. They also reported that a number of studies found that EMDR was superior to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) on some measures of PTSD symptoms. However, all of these studies had mixed trauma samples. Another data coming from this review is that between 77 and 90% of EMDR patients no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the end of treatment. Ponniah and Hollon findings provide support for the use of EMDR for all patients with PTSD. \n\nEMDR is a supplementary trauma-focused therapy that includes elements from other effective psychotherapies in a structured protocol drawn from an information processing model of PTSD (Bisson et al.,  ). It requires the individual suffering from PTSD to focus attention on a traumatic memory whilst simultaneously visually tracking the therapist\u2019s finger as it moves across his\/her visual field, and then to engage in a restructuring of the memory (Shapiro,  ). Eye movements are the most common form of bilateral stimulation, but stimulation might also be auditory (alternating tones) or sensory (finger tapping). It acts by using dual attention tasks to help the patient process the traumatic event while focusing on negative trauma-related memories, emotions and thoughts during the performance of a task that requires a bilateral stimulation (e.g., eye movements; hand tapping; tones) until a growth in more positive trauma-related thoughts (Jensen,  ; Shepherd et al.,  ; Marcus et al.,  ). \n\nSince its discovery, EMDR has been considered one of the treatments of choice for PTSD, even though studies on its effectiveness are often hindered by methodological problems (see for a critical review Cahill et al.,  ), and in the view of some authors \u201cwhat is effective in EMDR (imaginal exposure) is not new, and what is new (eye movements) is not effective\u201d (McNally,  , p. 2). Although bilateral stimulation is discussed controversially (Cahill et al.,  ), growing evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of EMDR in treating both PTSD in victims and mourning in survivors (Sprang,  ; Solomon and Rando,  ; see also meta-analysis studies: Bisson et al.,  ; Lee and Cuijpers,  ; Watts et al.,  ). Lee and Cuijpers ( ) performed a meta-analysis in which 15 clinical and 11 experimental studies demonstrated different effects of bilateral stimulation through eye movements compared with those produced by other exposure therapies. Possible explanations for the effectiveness of alternating bilateral stimulation are: stimulation acts specifically on disintegrated information related to the traumatic event, or boosts the processing of emotionally memories or, last but not least, may enhance emotional processing in general (Sprang,  ; Korn and Leeds,  ). Herkt et al. ( ) recently observed in healthy subjects without post-traumatic symptoms increased activation in the right amygdala during alternating auditory bilateral stimulation, as used in EMDR, while processing emotionally negative stimuli. These authors suggested that the increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models (Shapiro,  ,  ) of how alternating bilateral stimulation might help with the therapeutic reintegration of information. Specifically, Shapiro ( ) suggests two possible interpretations for the effects of alternating bilateral stimulation: (i) it may boost the processing of any emotionally laden material in general; or (ii) it may have a specific effect just on disintegrated information related to the traumatic episode. Clinicians also observe a decrease in vividness and arousal related to trauma-associated stimuli after EMDR, and neuroimaging studies show that after EMDR there is a decreased activation in limbic areas and increased activation in prefrontal brain regions known to be responsible for cognitive control after the completion of successful treatments (Lansing et al.,  ; Pagani et al.,  ). Clinical trials suggest that different traumatic events interact with individual factors (such as personality, gender and genetic factors) and lead to different physical and behavioral outcomes as well as a different prevalence of PTSD (Ditlevsen and Elklit,  ; Santiago et al.,  ; Husarewycz et al.,  ; Perrin et al.,  ). Even if altered brain areas after PTSD are common and play complementary roles in maintaining the PTSD symptomatology, such as fear conditioning of trauma-related stimuli and failing to recall fear extinction (Pitman et al.,  ). However, specific network of areas could be observed due to specific trauma. In details, PTSD after physical or sexual abuse modifies specific brain structures including the middle and anterior cingulate cortex (MCC; ACC), precuneus (pCU) and middle frontal gyrus (see Shin et al.,  ; Lanius et al.,  ,  ). These brain regions are involved in pain processing, fear, sadness and proprioceptive information. Differently, in the PTSD after combat-related trauma alterations have been found in a network of areas including the bilateral insula, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), superior parietal lobe (SPL) and hippocampus (Pissiota et al.,  ; Britton et al.,  ; Geuze et al.,  ; Morey et al.,  ). Also these structures are known to be involved in emotional processing, especially of sadness (Vogt,  ), and in monitoring internal body states, but they are also involved in a wide range of cognitive functions, including episodic memory, spatial navigation, imagining and planning for the future (Hassabis and Maguire,  ; Vann et al.,  ; Boccia et al.,  ). A specific network of areas is present also in PTSD after catastrophe and includes the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG; Hou et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Mazza et al.,  ). Specifically, the PHG has a crucial role in spatial navigation and in scene perception (Epstein and Morgan,  ) and it is reported only in this kind of trauma, likely due to the fact that the natural disasters mostly involved the surrounding environment and familiar places. Taking together these fMRI studies seem suggest that PTSD due to different kind of trauma can be different from a neurological and cognitive point of view. As a consequence also the variability in the psychological therapies effectiveness could be partially explained by the existence of different neural substrates underpinning the main disorder. \n\nIn view of this evidence, the main aim of the present study is to examine the extent to which neurobiological evidence supports the specific treatment of PTSD after MVA with EMDR. To pursue this aim we first reviewed previous neuroimaging studies about PTSD after MVA and those about neural correlates of EMDR. We hypothesized that by modulating the dysfunctional network of PTSD-MVA, EMDR may be the treatment of choice for patients who develop PTSD after a MVA. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on PTSD after MVA to assess neural network functional changes in people suffering from PTSD following a MVA, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Results have been discussed in light of current evidence about the neural underpinnings of EMDR, which suggests a specific and biologically-based approach to PTSD after MVA. \n\n### Neural Correlates of PTSD After Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) \n  \nIn the last decade different studies have assessed the neurobiological effect of PTSD after MVA (PTSD-MVA). fMRI studies mainly adopted trauma script-driven imagery paradigms, during which participants were required to remember olfactory, auditory, somato-sensory and visual sensations that were associated with their traumatic event (Frewen et al.,  , ; Osuch et al.,  ) or trauma-related pictures (Zhang et al.,  ). In PTSD-MVA patients, listening to trauma scripts leads to decreased activation in the bilateral amygdala and perirhinal cortex (Osuch et al.,  ). Studies also showed a negative correlation in PTSD patients between Emotional Awareness (measured by Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale, LEAS) and activation in the ACC during trauma script-driven imagery (Frewen et al.,  ). In terms of emotional processing, the altered activation and deactivation in the limbic system (i.e., ACC, perirhinal cortex and amygdala) may be the biological substrates of emotional dysfunctions, such as emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, observed in PTSD patients. Actually, Armony et al. ( ) found increased amygdala activation for unmasked happy faces, compared to fearful unmasked faces in PTSD patients. Their finding may contribute to explain why emotional numbing, that is the inability to fully experience positive emotions, is associated with PTSD (Litz and Gray,  ). Furthermore, as stressed by Mazza et al. ( ) emotional numbing is closely associated with emotion processing, and points to a deficit in the acquired ability to understand\/share emotions with others. fMRI evidence showed that people suffering from PTSD have functional alteration in emotional brain regions such as the amygdala and insula when presented with fearful and happy faces (Hendler et al.,  ; Armony et al.,  ). \n\nIn a delayed-response working memory task, where emotional (trauma-related) and non-emotional pictures were presented in the delay phase, PTSD-MVA patients showed higher activation in the emotion-processing regions, including the amygdala, precuneus and fusiform gyrus, but lower activation in the inferior frontal cortex, insula and left supramarginal gyrus than the control group (Zhang et al.,  ). The importance of these structures in emotional processing was demonstrated as far back in time as 1948, with the description of symptoms of Phineas Gage, a railroad construction foreman who as a consequence of a rock-blasting accident reported a large lesion in the left frontal lobe. His was one of the earliest documented cases providing evidence that frontal lobes were linked to judgment, decision-making, social conduct and personality (Bechara and Damasio,  ) in spite of a preserved intellect. Not only do frontal lobes contribute to delineating personality and monitoring emotions, they also play a crucial role in emotional processing, performed by some limbic structures, such as the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex and enthorinal cortex. Specifically, the amygdala is involved in fear conditioning (for a review see Janak and Tye,  ). \n\nIn addition, studies using resting-state fMRI paradigms demonstrated that individuals with PTSD-MVA showed a different amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, ALFF), with an increased ALFF in the left medial prefrontal cortex and the right ACC (Bing et al.,  ). A PET study also found a hyperperfusion in the right medial prefrontal cortex and ACC in people with PTSD-MVA (Osuch et al.,  ). Furthermore, Qin et al. ( ), using resting-state fMRI to assess functional connectivity in individuals with PTSD-MVA, found that compared with control participants people with PTSD exhibited decreased PCC connectivity with the right lingual and middle temporal gyri, as well as with the left lingual gyrus. On the other hand, the left inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and insula, left medial frontal lobe and ACC, and right medial frontal gyrus showed increased PCC connectivity in people with PTSD (Qin et al.,  ). These results suggest that patients with PTSD showed different patterns of resting-state functional connectivity. This is a method of functional neuroimaging that makes it possible to evaluate brain region interaction while individuals are not performing any cognitive task. Specifically, Qin et al. ( ) suggested that the increase in functional connectivity could explain the abnormal emotional responses in patients with PTSD, and interpreted the decrease in functional connectivity as being due to comorbid psychiatric disorders. \n\nStructural studies of PTSD after MVA mainly found a decrease in cortical thickness in the left medial prefrontal cortex, ACC and middle frontal gyrus as well as in the right STG (Bing et al.,  ). They also showed increased ALFF values in the prefrontal cortex, ACC and cerebellum. This increased regional activity is known to be important for emotional processing (for an extensive review see Drevets,  ). \n\nFurthermore, structural connectivity network analysis in people with PTSD-MVA, assessed by using diffusion tensor tractography, demonstrated abnormal global properties mainly due to an increased shortest path length (Long et al.,  ). Furthermore, individuals with PTSD-MVA showed enhanced nodal centralities in the bilateral anterior cingulate and pallidum, and in the hippocampus and PHG, and decreased nodal centralities in medial orbito-frontal cortex (Long et al.,  ). These authors suggest that as the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the extinction of conditioned fear, the disruption of the nodal centralities of the orbitofrontal cortex plays a role in the persistence of PTSD symptoms. \n\nIn summary, fMRI evidence showed that PTSD-MVA is characterized by the alteration in the limbic system (i.e., ACC, perirhinal cortex and amygdala) in the left medial prefrontal cortex, in the orbitofrontal cortex and in the middle frontal gyrus as well as in the right STG. These areas are also involved in different degree of changes also in PTSD caused by other traumas, however, the limbic system and in particular of the ACC are more involved in PTSD due to MVA with respect to other traumas. However, more fMRI studies should be performed to better understand neural mechanisms underlying different type of traumas and above all to state that an area is involved only in one type of trauma with respect to another one it should be performed a meta-analysis in which neural correlates coming from different studies on different traumas are analyzed with the aim to individuate cluster of activations. \n\n\n### Neural Correlates of EMDR \n  \nWhile several studies have assessed the behavioral effect of EMDR therapy (as reported above), less attention has been given to neural correlates of recovery after EMDR. One of the most important findings comes from neurophysiological studies, using electroencephalography (EEG). It has recently been found that EMDR facilitates the processing of traumatic memories in eye movement desensitization by improving interhemispheric coherence, measured by EEG (Samara et al.,  ). With regard to brain regions supporting EMDR efficacy in PTSD, both functional and structural neuroimaging studies have been conducted. In a single case analysis Levin and colleagues, using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), found that recovery from PTSD symptoms after EMDR is correlated to increased activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the left frontal lobe (Levin et al.,  ). These authors concluded that successful treatment of PTSD does not reduce arousal at the limbic level, but rather enhances the ability to differentiate real from imagined threats (Levin et al.,  ). Further studies shed some light on the possible neural mechanism involved in recovery from PTSD after EMDR therapy. Lansing et al. ( ), using SPECT to assess the neural effect of EMDR therapy in Police Officers with PTSD, found decreased activation in the left and right occipital lobe, left parietal lobe, and right precentral frontal lobe and increased activation in the left IFG, after 10 h (4 sessions) of EMDR therapy. Furthermore, Nardo et al. ( ) used MRI and Voxel Based Morphometry to assess neural predictors of EMDR therapy in people developing PTSD after occupational trauma. These authors found that individuals who did not respond to EMDR showed a significantly lower gray matter density than responders in the bilateral posterior cingulate, as well as in the right anterior insula, anterior PHG and amygdala. They also found that gray matter density negatively correlated with trauma load in the bilateral posterior cingulate, left anterior insula, and right anterior PHG. Thus, they concluded that gray matter lower density in limbic and paralimbic cortices was associated with PTSD diagnosis, trauma load and EMDR treatment outcome. \n\nAs regards the neurobiological mechanism underlying EMDR effects, it has been proposed that the repetitive redirecting of attention in EMDR induces a neurobiological state, similar to that of REM sleep, which allows for re-processing of traumatic memories (Stickgold,  ). Specifically, Stickgold ( ) proposed that EMDR leads to a reduction in the strength of hippocampally mediated episodic memories and amygdala-dependent emotional memories. This hypothesis is consistent with the neuroanatomical findings reported above. \n\nThe above-reported neuroimaging evidence seems to suggest that by modulating the neural circuits altered in PTSD after MVA, EMDR may represent the \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d for PTSD-MVA. EMDR modulating activation in limbic areas and prefrontal regions (Lansing et al.,  ; Pagani et al.,  ) may actually result in the regulation of the dysfunctional network in PTSD-MVA patients, allowing for the reprocessing of episodic and emotional traumatic memories. \n\nIn the paragraphs below we will present results from a meta-analysis of the previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD-MVA, which suggest a biological-founded model for treating PTSD after MVA. \n\n\n\n## Meta-Analysis \n  \n### Studies Selection \n  \nA systematic method was adopted to review literature. The search was carried out using PubMed, a free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature in which all articles using fMRI method are reported. Relevant articles were identified through searches using the following string: (PTSD FMRI) OR PTSD PET. Searches of this database were limited to articles written in English. This produced 615 papers. Our a-priori inclusion criteria for papers were: (1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET); this excluded papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. (2) Providing of coordinates of activation foci, either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space. (3) All participants in the studies were diagnosed with PTSD after MVA. (4) PTSD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, including symptoms persisting for 6 months or more. (5) Other psychiatric disorders or other trauma-related PTSD were excluded. (6) Only group studies were included. Two authors (L.P. and M.B.) independently identified studies matching with the criteria reported above. Only published studies were included in our meta-analysis. \n\nUsing these criteria, we selected only 6 papers reporting 9 individual experiments on PTSD-MVA patients (440 subjects; 30 activation foci). Meta-analysis was carried out on selected studies using the \u201cactivation likelihood estimation\u201d (ALE) analysis. Studies are summarized in Table  . \n  \n fMRI Studies on PTSD-MVA included in the ALE meta-analysis  . \n  \n Notes. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were adopted in the three studies in which time is not specified  . \n  \n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) analyzes the probability that a voxel will contain at least one of the activation foci; it is calculated at each voxel, and results in a thresholded ALE map. ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modeling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nWe performed a general ALE analysis to determine whether a consistent neural substrate of PTSD was found across neuroimaging studies of PTSD after MVA. Then, by means of meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), used to assess the functional connectivity of specific brain regions (Robinson et al.,  ), we investigated the functional connectivity of a brain region that emerged as showing a consistent modification in PTSD-MVA, from the first ALE analysis. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.1.1 (brainmap.org) with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE). According to Eickhoff et al.\u2019s ( ) modified procedure, the ALE values of each voxel in the brain were computed, and a test was performed to determine the null distribution of the ALE statistic of each voxel. The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) value was automatically computed, as this parameter is empirically determined (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The thresholded ALE map was computed using   p   values from the previous step and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) at the 0.05 level of significance (Tom Nichol\u2019s FDR algorithm). Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200 mm  was chosen. A cluster analysis was performed on the thresholded map. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template (brainmap.org) using Mricro. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nResults from the general ALE meta-analysis showed a cluster of activation in the right ACC (  x   = 8;   y   = 46;   z   = 12) (Figure  ). Thus, we assessed the functional connectivity of the ACC by means of MACM. MACM showed patterns of functional connectivity of the ACC, especially at the level of the frontal, parietal and limbic lobes (Figure  ). In detail, we found clusters of activation in the bilateral ACC, insula, IFG, left precentral and cingulate gyri and claustrum, as well as in the right middle and superior frontal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, globus pallidus and thalamus (Figure  ). \n  \n Results from ALE meta-analysis. (A)   Results from the general ALE meta-analysis on neural modifications of PTSD after Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs).   (B)   Functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), assessed by means of meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main aim of the present study is to provide neurobiological evidence on which to base a biological-founded treatment model for PTSD after MVA. Neuroimaging evidence reviewed in the introduction section appears to suggest that by modulating the neural circuits altered in PTSD after MVA, EMDR may represent a \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d for PTSD-MVA. Thus, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of PTSD-MVA to assess (a) brain areas showing consistent modifications in PTSD after MVA; and (b) their functional connectivity. \n\nGlobal results from the present meta-analysis demonstrate that PTSD-MVA is correlated with consistent neural modifications mainly located at the level of the right ACC, whose activity is in turn strongly correlated with activity in the frontal, parietal and limbic lobes. Also based on previous neuroimaging evidence of neural underpinnings of EMDR (Levin et al.,  ; Lansing et al.,  ; Nardo et al.,  ; Samara et al.,  ), we propose that by modulating the dysfunctional network of PTSD-MVA, EMDR may be a treatment of choice for patients who develop PTSD after a MVA. In other words, by working on the neural network that we found altered in PTSD-MVA, EMDR may produce a normalization of the dysfunctional network. \n\nThe neural impact of other therapies does in any case need to be considered. Firstly, the main element of all psychological therapies treating anxiety disorders (including PTSD) is exposure to the feared object or context (Joseph and Gray,  ). Exposure is based on extinction learning (Myers and Davis,  ; Quirk and Mueller,  ; Herry et al.,  ), which relies on inhibition of the amygdala by the prefrontal regions and engages executive functions, mainly recruiting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LeDoux,  ). Furthermore, the greater activity in the left frontostriatal circuit is associated with lower PTSD symptom severity after treatment with CBT (Falconer et al.,  ). Also, the greater bilateral amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate activation is associated with a poor outcome after CBT (Bryant et al.,  ). CBT has been found to regulate brain activations at the level of frontal network and of the limbic structures (Goldapple et al.,  ). In fMRI studies the changes after psychotherapies administered to face major depression, phobia, obsessive compulsive disorders emerge that the psychotherapies (i.e., CBT, Interpersonal Therapy, Behavioral Therapy; Mindfulness based cognitive therapy; computer assisted cognitive remediation and psychodynamic therapy) mainly targets at brain networks (including precuneus and orbito frontal cortex) able to mediate a top-down effect on symptoms improving. They might induce modifications especially in the medial portion of the parietal (i.e., precuneus, as described before), frontal (i.e., superior and inferior frontal gyri) and temporal lobes (i.e., middle temporal gyrus) (Brody et al.,  ; Yamanishi et al.,  ; Buchheim et al.,  ; Ives-Deliperi et al.,  ; Meusel et al.,  ; Yoshimura et al.,  ). Some brain areas modulated by psychotherapies are common with those modulated by EMDR, such as frontal, parietal and limbic structures. However, EMDR acts on ACC that is an important role in the fear extinction. ACC is also a structure modified in PTSD and specifically in PTSD due to MVA. \n\nA systematic review of psychological therapies for chronic PTSD showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms is reduced by using individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) and EMDR. This result emerged from 70 studies involving a total of 4,761 participants, demonstrating more effective TFCBT and EMDR than waitlist\/usual care (Bisson et al.,  ). These authors found no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post-treatment, although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non-TFCBT at follow-up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non-TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non-TFCBT was more effective than waitlist\/usual care and other therapies. Worthy of note however is the fact that a considerable proportion of patients (30\u201350%) do not respond to TFCBT (Bradley et al.,  ). Generally speaking, both TFCBT and EMDR are highly efficacious in reducing PTSD symptoms, due to common underlying factors involved in different treatments for PTSD, such as an exposure model to treat the trauma, which causes the patient to rethink previous interpretations of the traumatic event, addressing faulty cognitions or maladaptive copying strategies, and also promoting fear extinction (Bradley et al.,  ). \n\nEMDR on the other hand has repeatedly been found to rely on the ACC (Yamasaki et al.,  ), which we found to be biased in PTSD after MVA. Thus, EMDR may be considered one of the treatments of choice for PTSD after MVA, since it directly acts on the brain region showing an alteration in these patients. It is also possible that the effectiveness of EMDR on PTSD-MVA is related to its action on conditioned fear, mediated by ACC, due to repeated exposure to the traumatic event, while other cognitive therapies like CBT, promoting the rationalization and acceptance of the trauma, modulate the response of the prefrontal cortex, inducing a secondary response on the ACC. This different action could explain the difference between EMDR and CBT, supporting Solomon and Rando ( ), who reported positive treatment effects, obtained more quickly with EMDR compared with other forms of therapies. \n\nAnyway, EMDR cannot be considered suitable just for MVA-PTSD. Actually, EMDR has been successfully used, to treat PTSD after different traumatic events (Lansing et al.,  ; El Khoury-Malhame et al.,  ; Bisson et al.,  ). Unfortunately, as highlighted in the introduction, the paucity of studies assessing neural correlates of EMDR therapy does not allow us to come to any definite conclusion in respect of firstline treatment, even if current data support a biological foundation for EMDR in treating PTSD-MVA and PTSD after other types of traumatic events, such as rape, work-related accidents or duty-induced PTSD (Lansing et al.,  ; El Khoury-Malhame et al.,  ; Bisson et al.,  ). It should be noted that current literature lacks systematic studies that take into account the nature of the trauma event and the treatment effect. Thus, even though further systematic studies are needed to prove that EMDR is one of the best approaches to treating PTSD following a MVA, we believe it may be one of the most effective. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4404810,"text_md5":"8d0e847052a3193425f867f39f7194bd","field_positions":{"authors":[0,112],"journal":[113,131],"publication_year":[133,137],"title":[148,246],"keywords":[260,384],"abstract":[397,1501],"body":[1510,31967]},"batch":2,"pmid":25954183,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2015.00213","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4404810","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4404810"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4404810\">4404810<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4404810  EMDR therapy for PTSD after motor vehicle accidents: meta-analytic evidence for specific treatment"}

In recent years, advances in neuroimaging techniques have provided new perspectives to elucidate the central mechanisms of acupuncture for MCI. Many acupuncture brain imaging studies have found significant improvements in brain function after acupuncture treatment of MCI, but the underlying mechanisms of brain regions modulation are unclear. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nA meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of MCI patients treated with acupuncture was conducted to summarize the effects of acupuncture on the modulation of MCI brain regions from a neuroimaging perspective. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nUsing acupuncture, neuroimaging, magnetic resonance, and Mild Cognitive Impairment as search terms, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine disk (CBM disk), Wanfang and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) for brain imaging studies on acupuncture on MCI published up to April 2022. Voxel-based neuroimaging meta-analysis of fMRI data was performed using voxel-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI), allowing for Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) correction correction for correction multiple comparisons of results. Subgroup analysis was used to compare the differences in brain regions between the acupuncture treatment group and other control groups. Meta-regression was used to explore demographic information and altered cognitive function effects on brain imaging outcomes. Linear models were drawn using MATLAB 2017a, and visual graphs for quality evaluation were produced using R software and RStudio software. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of seven studies met the inclusion criteria, with 94 patients in the treatment group and 112 patients in the control group. All studies were analyzed using the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method. The experimental design of fMRI included six task state studies and one resting-state study. The meta-analysis showed that MCI patients had enhanced activity in the right insula, left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus, right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, and right middle temporal gyrus brain regions after acupuncture treatment. Further analysis of RCT and longitudinal studies showed that Reho values were significantly elevated in two brain regions, the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus and the right insula, after acupuncture. The MCI group showed stronger activity in the right supramarginal gyrus after acupuncture treatment compared to healthy controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that the right anterior thalamic projection ReHo index was significantly correlated with the MMSE score after acupuncture treatment in all MCI patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAcupuncture therapy has a modulating effect on the brain regions of MCI patients. However, due to the inadequate experimental design of neuroimaging studies, multi-center neuroimaging studies with large samples are needed better to understand the potential neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture for MCI. In addition, machine learning algorithm-based predictive models for evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture for MCI may become a focus of future research. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \n, identifier: CRD 42022287826. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurodegenerative disorder between normal aging and dementia that is most prominently characterized by the presence of mild isolated cognitive decline without significant impairment in activities of daily living. MCI is considered a pre-dementia state associated with a 10-fold increased risk of progression to dementia, severely affecting the patient's quality of life (Petersen,  ). The first clinical feature of mild cognitive impairment is memory impairment, which can involve other specific changes in motor function, executive function, language, and visuospatial structural skills, depending on the cause or the site of brain damage (Marshall et al.,  ; Montero-Odasso et al.,  ). The current global prevalence of MCI is 6.7%, with an estimated overall prevalence of 15.5% among adults aged 60 years and older in China (Petersen et al.,  ; Jia et al.,  ). MCI has become an important issue in public health and has attracted the attention of a growing number of researchers, policy makers and healthcare providers. \n\nThe main pathological mechanisms of MCI are related to amyloid pathology, neurofibrillary tangle pathology, neuronal deficits, and damage to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal region (Kordower et al.,  ). Among these, brain amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques are a hallmark lesion of people with a clinical diagnosis of MCI (Mufson et al.,  ). As neuroimaging methods have proliferated in recent years, more researchers have focused on alterations in brain structure and function in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), particularly in identifying relevant neural markers. A meta-analysis reported resting-state abnormalities in the posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, superior limbic gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus in participants with MCI (Lau et al.,  ). There are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of MCI, and neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine is recommended for the treatment of MCI (Langa and Levine,  ). Therefore, exploring the potential of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent MCI has received increasing attention. \n\nAs a suitable alternative medical treatment, acupuncture has been used empirically for thousands of years while gaining worldwide attention and recognition (Kim et al.,  ). Numerous previous clinical and animal studies have shown that acupuncture may be an effective adjunctive treatment for neurological disorders, such as cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia, and can effectively improve cognitive and memory function (Du et al.,  ; Ding et al.,  ; Ji et al.,  ; Su et al.,  ; Zhi et al.,  ). The therapeutic mechanism may be related to downregulation of A\u03b2 accumulation and tau protein phosphorylation, reduction of neuroinflammation, reduction of neuronal apoptosis, improvement of mitochondrial activity, enhancement of synaptic plasticity, and restoration of the blood-brain barrier (Yin et al.,  ). However, there is a lack of research to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of acupuncture for MCI from the perspective of brain region modulation. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanism of action from the perspective of brain structure and function. \n\nNumerous studies have proven that neuroimaging techniques can accurately record changes in brain regions for neurological diseases and treatment effects (Jiang et al.,  ; Dan,  ; Risacher and Saykin,  ). Neuroimaging methods have become a critical tool for performing research to develop a better understanding of brain circuit alterations associated with etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment response (Kalin,  ). The spatial variability properties of the brain were evaluated by analyzing changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs). An increasing number of studies have applied fMRI techniques to evaluate the clinical effects of acupuncture for MCI (Wang et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Shan et al.,  ). However, the small sample size between the different clinical designs led to variability in the experimental results. \n\nTherefore, to elucidate the modulatory effects of brain regions in acupuncture for MCI, this paper uses a coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) to integrate the imaging findings from clinical studies quantitatively. The CBMA is a widely used method to solve the discrepancies of regional alterations among various neuroimaging studies (Jiang et al.,  ). The Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) is an advanced statistical technique for CBMA on different neuroimaging techniques such as structural MRI, fMRI, DTI, or PET (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). The SDM-PSI approach allows reported peak coordinates combined with statistical parametric maps, thus ensuring more exhaustive and accurate meta-analyses (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). By analyzing the effect of acupuncture on the modulation of MCI brain regions, the therapeutic effect of acupuncture was elucidated from a neuroimaging perspective, providing new ideas for treating neurological diseases with acupuncture. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nAll procedures for this meta-analysis were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA guidelines) (PRISMA). This study was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD 42022287826) (Liberati et al.,  ; Moher et al.,  ; Page et al.,  ). \n\n### Literature search \n  \nWe searched the following electronic databases from the establishment of the databases to April 2022: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine disk (CBM disk), Wan Fang, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP). The search process was carried out independently by two researchers. The search terms included: (mild cognitive impairment OR cognitive impairment OR cognitive decline OR cognitive deficit OR cognitive dysfunction OR cognitive disorders OR cognitive dissonance OR amnestic OR MCI) AND (acupuncture OR meridian OR acupuncture therapy OR acupuncture treatment OR acupoint OR electroacupuncture OR electro-acupuncture OR ear acupuncture OR auriculotherapy OR scalp acupuncture) AND (RCT OR randomized controlled trial OR controlled clinical trial OR randomized OR clinical trial OR randomly OR trial OR \u201crandom*\u201d OR \u201calloc*\u201dOR \u201cassign*) AND (fMRI OR functional MRI OR functional magnetic resonance imaging OR neuroimaging OR voxel-based morphometry OR VBM OR resting state). In addition, professional journals, reference lists of relevant articles, and conference abstracts related to MCI and acupuncture were hand-searched in the library to ensure a comprehensive literature search. Among them, four Chinese journals and two English journals related to acupuncture were manually searched in the library:Acupuncture Research (from 1976), Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion (from 1981), Journal of Clinical Acupuncture and Moxibustion (from 1985), Shanghai Journal of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (from 1982), Acupuncture in Medicine (from 1982), and Medical Acupuncture (from 2007) through March 2017. The language during the search process is restricted to articles published in English or Chinese. Boolean logic operations are used to develop search formulas for different search libraries. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nAll studies were screened for title, abstract and full text and were conducted independently by two researchers (ML and ZZ). In case of disagreement, the two researchers reached an agreed result through discussion. The following inclusion criteria were based on PICO standards: \n\nParticipants: Clinical trials with clear diagnostic criteria for MCI, with no restrictions on participant age or gender. \n  \n(1) Interventions: The treatment group used various acupuncture therapies (e.g., pure acupuncture, body acupuncture, electroacupuncture, ear acupuncture) or acupuncture combined with other medications. We did not set limitations for intensity, frequency, or course of treatment. \n  \n(2) Comparison Groups: The comparison group can be treated with any non-acupuncture method but should be consistent with the baseline information of the intervention group (e.g., age, gender, etc.). \n  \n(3) Outcomes: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and subjective scale outputs. It mainly involves whole-brain functional imaging (ReHo or ALFFs) at rest or in the task state. Peak coordinates (  x, y, z  ) and effect sizes (  t  -value, or   z  -value or   P  -value) reported in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard stereotactic space. All samples were included if one study involved two or more comparable datasets. Secondary outcomes were used to assess clinical efficacy, measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Brief Mental State Examination (MMSE). \n  \nWe excluded the following types of articles: articles using ROI or seed voxel-based analyses, missing significant information on results [e.g., coordinates significant clusters (  P   < 0.05)], methodological studies, conference summaries, and preliminary trials with complete overlap. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nTwo independent evaluators (ZZ and HZ) screened the literature based on inclusion criteria. Titles and abstracts of all studies retrieved through the search strategy were first screened using EndNote and duplicates were removed. The second screening was performed mainly by further review of the full text of the literature. In case of disagreement during the screening process, the document was submitted to a third evaluator for consultation and eventual agreement. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nWe extracted the full text of the literature based on a pretest post data extraction form. Data extraction was performed independently by two assessors (LY and YL) based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by cross-checking. Data were validated by a third assessor (HH). If data were missing, authors were contacted by email for further information. Data were extracted from the included studies with the following standardization: (1) publication data (author, year); (2) basic information about the trial design study (Study trial type, Comparison, Sample size, Scanning instrument, clinical outcome measures, neuroimaging techniques, task-based\/resting-state study design, episodic\/interval conditions, image acquisition timing, analysis methods); (3) acupuncture manipulation (primary acupoints, acupuncture modality, frequency, duration, duration of treatment); (4) participants (gender, age, education, Symptom severity); (5) neuroimaging results. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nQuality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and was conducted independently by two researchers. All reports were assessed according to the following seven criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at low, high, or unclear risk of bias. Visual graph production for quality evaluation using R software version 4.1.3 and R Studio version 2022.02.0. \n\n\n### SDM-PSI meta-analysis \n  \nVoxel-based meta-analyses of regional brain differences were performed using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) (version 6.21,  ). This software package uses reported peak coordinates extracted from databases with statistical parametric maps. It reconstructed the original maps of regional differences in the brain, thus revealing the neural substrates of many brain functions and neuropsychiatric disorders (Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre and Radua,  ). The procedures included collecting the data, creating SDM table, pre-processing, mean analysis, heterogeneity, publication bias, and grading. \n\nIn the data collection step, a text file is created for each study, containing the peak coordinates and   t  -values, and the name of the text file must be \u201cXXX.spm_mni.txt.\u201d If the study had no peaks, its text file was recorded as having no content with the extension \u201c.no_peaks.txt\u201d. In the Create SDM Table step, enter general information about the studies in the SDM Table Editor, including their identification (column \u201cstudy\u201d), their sample sizes, the   t  -value that they used as statistical thresholds (column \u201ct_thr\u201d), and other potential variables to conduct subgroup analyses or meta-regressions. Of particular note is the presence of specified thresholds in each study, applying the same statistical thresholds to estimate the maps more accurately. In the preprocessing step, SDM-PSI estimates the lower limit of the size of the possible effect size images (i.e., the lowest potential effect size for each voxel) and their upper limit (i.e., the maximum potential effect size for each voxel) of the images from the peak coordinates and effect sizes collected for each study, respectively, to compare the peak coordinates and effect sizes between the treatment and control groups. SDM-PSI performed a meta-analysis of NSUE (MetaNSUE) based on maximum likelihood estimation and multiple imputation algorithms (Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). MetaNSUE was used to estimate the most likely effect sizes and their standard errors, thus creating several imputations. In the mean analysis, the weighted mean difference of the regional gray matter of the sample size of this study is expressed. This includes calculating the random-effects mean of the ReHo values, with the mean weighted by the sample size and variance of each study. Secondly, a meta-analysis was performed for each dataset using a standard random-effects model, and then the coefficients of these datasets and their covariances and heterogeneity statistics I and Q were combined using Rubin's rule. Finally, corrections were made by clustering-based thresholds, using uncorrected   p   < 0.001 as the threshold for cluster formation at the cluster level, along with Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) correction (  p   < 0.05 and voxel extent \u2265 10) and the use of threshold-free clustering enhancement (TFCE) in statistical thresholds at the cluster level. To set the null distribution, 1000 replacement trials were performed. The details of these procedures are extensively described in the SDM-PSI reference manual ( ). \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nThe MNI peak coordinates were extracted and analyzed for heterogeneity to obtain the standard heterogeneity statistic   I  .   I   < 50% indicates low heterogeneity. Funnel plots were not performed because the amount of included studies (  n   = 7) was <10, but the Egger test was used to assess the publication bias. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analysis \n  \nThe potential effects of clinical variables such as gender, age, years of education, duration of illness, and severity of clinical symptoms (  p   < 0.00005, uncorrected, and voxels > 10 indicate statistical differences) were explored by simple linear regression analysis. Linear models were drawn using MATLAB 2017a. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of included studies \n  \nOur search identified seven studies that met the inclusion criteria (Hou et al.,  ; Jiang et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Jia et al.,  ; Shan et al.,  ). Based on the search strategy, the database search identified 275 articles and 77 articles were deleted due to duplication. After screening by title and abstract, 156 articles were further excluded. Of the 42 eligible relevant studies, 34 studies were excluded after the full-text screening. Of these 34 studies, 10 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria, 16 did not use fMRI, four did not use ReHo or ALFF methods, and four had incomplete data. A total of seven studies were included in the final analyses.   represents the PRISMA flow diagram of the article search. \n  \nFlowchart of literature selection. \n  \nAll trials that met the inclusion criteria were published between 2010 and 2020. All clinical studies recruited one hundred and eighty patients (112 MCI patients and 68 healthy controls). There were no significant differences in demographic baseline characteristics (including age, gender, and years of education) between the two groups. Baseline characteristics of clinical symptoms were assessed using subjective scales (including MMSE, CDR, and auditory verbal learning test), and all met the inclusion criteria. Most studies used a new non-repeated event-related (NRER) fMRI design model to explore the ongoing effects of acupuncture on MCI. Only 1 study used a conventional acupuncture modality with a 4-week duration of treatment (Wang et al.,  ). The Main acupoints included Tai Chong (LR3), Tai Xi (KI3), Bai Hui (DU20) and He Gu (LI4). The acupuncture method was mainly carried out in the balanced \u201ctonifying and reducing\u201d technique, while the positioning and operation of acupuncture points were based on international standards (Hui et al.,  ). All studies reported fMRI coordinate data using the ReHo variable to analyze the brain region activation effect before and after acupuncture treatment and the difference in its comparison with sham acupuncture and healthy control group. The details and features of the studies are shown in  ,  . Anatomical localization of the acupoints mentioned in the included studies are shown in  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of included studies. \n    \nScanning methods and major brain region alterations in the included studies. \n  \nRS, resting state; AS, acupuncture stste; NRER, non-repeated event-related; ReHo: regional homogeneity; MNI: Montreal Neurological Institute. \n  \n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the evaluation criteria were divided into seven entries. Of the seven studies, only one reported on the method of random sequence generation (Shan et al.,  ). No studies mentioned allocation concealment and blinding, and the risk of bias was unclear. Evaluation of incomplete outcome data depended on whether the clear descriptions of baseline data were shown. Based on this evaluation criterion, all studies reported outcome data in full and were judged to be low risk. Although none of the studies had a study protocol, all expected outcome indicators were reported, including those that were predetermined and therefore judged to be low risk. In addition, we did not find any other sources of bias. In general, the quality of these studies was not high, mainly in terms of study design.   illustrates the quality assessment of the included studies. \n  \nQuality assessment of included studies. \n  \n\n### Results of meta-analysis \n  \n#### Acupuncture for the modulation of brain regions in MCI patients \n  \nIn a pooled meta-analysis, brain region coordinates based on Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) correction (  p   < 0.05) thresholds were analyzed for PRE and POST acupuncture treatment for MCI patients in the group. The results showed that acupuncture treatment showed significant increases in Reho values in six brain regions, mainly including the right insula (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 3.362), left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 3.482), right thalamus (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 3.967), right middle frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 2.544), right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 2.185) and right middle temporal gyrus (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 2.332), indicating hyperactivation of these brain regions after acupuncture treatment. The differences in regional activity in the gray matter of the brain PRE and POST acupuncture treatment in MCI patients based on coordinate analysis are shown in   and  . Further analysis of the RCTs and longitudinal studies (Jiang et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ) revealed significantly higher Reho values in two brain regions after acupuncture, including the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 3.482) and the right insula (  p   < 0.05,   z   = 3.362) (see  ). \n  \nRegional differences in brain gray matter volume activity PRE and POST acupuncture treatment in the coordinate-based meta-analysis. \n  \nPeak height threshold: z > 1.

The results showed a significant difference in the right supramarginal gyrus after acupuncture treatment in the MCI group compared to the healthy control group.

In addition, we used Egger's test to assess potential publication bias in the meta-analysis. There was low heterogeneity in the peak coordinate effect size differences in the right insula, left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus, right cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus (  I   = 0.64\u201317.23). The heterogeneity results are shown in  . The Egger test differences were not statistically significant (  p   = 0.432), and the study had no significant publication bias. \n\n\n### Meta regression analysis \n  \nMeta-regression was used to find potential correlations between acupuncture treatment MCI subjective scale scores, baseline information and brain regions. Whole-brain meta-regression analysis found that MMSE scores in MCI patients were negatively correlated with regional activity in the right corticospinal projection (peak coordinates:   x   = 10,   y   = \u221218,   z   = \u22122, voxel = 22,   r   = 0.73,   p   = 0.003354549). However, there were two discrete values in the regression plots. No significant correlation was found between any regional functional change and mean age, gender percentage, education, or CDR score.

Regression lines (Meta-regression SDM slopes) are shown as straight lines. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we used the SDM-PSI method to summarize the effect of acupuncture on the modulation of MCI brain regions from the neuroimaging perspective through a meta-analysis of brain imaging studies of MCI patients treated with acupuncture. The within-group comparison results confirmed the effect of acupuncture on regional brain region modulation in MCI patients, with enhanced activity in the right insula, left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus, right cingulate\/central parabrachial gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus brain regions after acupuncture treatment. Further analysis of RCT and longitudinal studies showed that Reho values were significantly elevated in two brain regions, the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus and the right insula, after acupuncture. Also, the results of intergroup comparison showed significant differences in brain activation regions in the MCI group compared with the healthy control group after acupuncture treatment, mainly in the right supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the right anterior thalamic projection ReHo index was significantly correlated with MMSE scores. Functional characterization showed that these regions were mainly involved in cognitive, emotional, and decision-making regions, which may provide a possible central mechanism for acupuncture treatment of MCI from a neuroimaging perspective. \n\n### Modulatory effects of acupuncture on brain regions of MCI \n  \nThe results showed that MCI patients had increased Reho values and enhanced brain region activity in the right insula, left cingulate\/paracentral gyrus, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus, right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, and right middle temporal gyrus after acupuncture treatment. In particular, activity was significantly increased in the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus and the right insula. The above brain regions were mainly involved in cognitive, emotional, and decision-making regions, which confirmed to some extent the modulatory effect of acupuncture on brain regions in MCI. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local resting functional connectivity, has been shown to be a promising biomarker in a variety of psychiatric disorders (Liu et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Jiang and Zuo,  ). ReHo is a voxel-based measure of brain activity that assesses the time series of a given voxel in relation to its similarity or synchrony between the time series of a particular voxel (Liu et al.,  ). \n\nA brain imaging study of Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) showed reduced ReHo values and reduced spontaneous synchronization in the left insula and that ReHo values were significantly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (Li et al.,  ). The association between regional ReHo values and the clinical severity index of cognitive impairment (i.e., MoCA) may laterally validate the potential correlation between the insula and cognitive function. The insula is associated with sensory, motor, visual perceptual, memory, and executive impairments (Chang et al.,  ; Namkung et al.,  ). A functional neuroimaging study of the insula showed that activation of the anterior insula cortex and anterior cingulate cortex was the most common focus of cognitive tasks, including detection processes of perception and consciousness (Sterzer et al.,  ). This study showed that acupuncture therapy was also associated with hyperactivation of the insula and could activate the insula to exert therapeutic effects, which is consistent with previous studies. \n\nThe anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) is a critical limbic system component. Previous studies have shown that ACC is primarily involved in affective motivation and cognitive attention (Bush et al.,  ; Apps et al.,  ). A neuroimaging meta-analysis on MCI showed reduced anterior cingulate ReHo values in amnestic MCI, which could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for MCI and also as a new target for appropriate intervention to delay progression (Song et al.,  ). Previous studies have shown that acupuncture activates brain regions in the anterior cingulate gyrus, primarily in MCI, ischemic stroke, and migraine (Tan et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ). Our meta-analysis found that acupuncture increased ReHo in the Left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, which is consistent with the previous findings. Therefore, the increased ReHo of left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri may be a potential mechanism for acupuncture in the treatment of MCI. The thalamus, as a diverse hub, is involved in a wide range of behavioral cognitions, such as arousal regulation, attentional selection, and working memory (Saalmann et al.,  ; Crossley et al.,  ; De Bourbon-Teles et al.,  ; Hwang et al.,  ). The thalamus has been shown to interact with different cortical regions convergently and be involved in various cognitive functions, and memory may be the first cognitive function formally associated with the thalamus (Wolff and Vann,  ). A clinical study on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques for aMCI showed reduced right thalamic ReHo values in patients with aMCI compared to normal older adults (Min et al.,  ). In a clinical trial of acupuncture in relation to MCI, patients with MCI showed significant changes in functional connectivity in brain regions such as the hippocampus, thalamus and syrinx gyrus after acupuncture to K13 compared to HC (Feng et al.,  ). The thalamus, ACC, and insula constitute significant central autonomic networks, and they are also commonly activated in tasks related to emotion, memory, and mutual sensation (Cauda et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ). Thus, acupuncture's modulation of brain regions in MCI may be related to homogeneous regional activation of the thalamus, insula and ACC, but the presence of structural-functional connections remains to be further investigated. \n\nThe middle frontal gyrus (MFG) is involved in attention, working memory, and language related processing (Briggs et al.,  ). Several functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) plays a role in working memory (Klingberg et al.,  ; Vartanian et al.,  ; Yin et al.,  ). In a study examining the different responses to acupuncture in MCI patients and age-matched healthy individuals as reflected by the regional homogeneity (ReHo) index, the elevated ReHo values in MCI patients were mainly distributed in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), superior parietal lobe (SPL), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and superior marginal gyrus (SMG) in the resting state after acupuncture (Liu et al.,  ). Numerous studies have shown that right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (DCG) is associated with cognitive function, possibly as part of the default network connection (Feng et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ). A study showed that the integration and dissociation of dynamic functional connectivity states tended to decrease as MCI worsened, and in some states, such as IPL.L-MTG.R and DCG.R-SMG.L, functional brain connectivity was significantly enhanced (Jiao et al.,  ). Reduced glucose metabolism in the right middle temporal gyrus (RMTG) is a powerful biomarker of subjective cognitive decline (Dong et al.,  ). According to previous reports, the MTG region has close functional connectivity with the hippocampus, is primarily involved in verbal or semantic cognition, and is also associated with oral memory (Vandenberghe et al.,  ; Beason-Held et al.,  ). In previous studies, changes in MTG after acupuncture treatment were mainly in Parkinson's Disease (Chae et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ). An fMRI study on acupuncture for Parkinson's disease showed increased connectivity between the left MTG and the pre-central gyrus (PCG) in the acupuncture group (Yu et al.,  ). And as a result of dopamine insensitivity, patients with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive deficits (Robbins and Cools,  ). Also, several studies have shown that there is a co-morbid mechanism between Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment in neuroimaging, which also provides a reference for future research on the mechanism of acupuncture on cognitive impairment (Delgado-Alvarado et al.,  ; Jozwiak et al.,  ; Baiano et al.,  ). \n\nIn addition, the results of the group comparison showed that there was a significant difference between the MCI group in the right supramarginal gyrus after acupuncture treatment compared to the healthy control group. This may imply a specific brain region modulatory effect of acupuncture in the MCI population compared to healthy individuals. In a brain imaging study exploring region-specific neurovascular uncoupling associated with cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson's disease, it was shown that local regulatory abnormalities in the PD-MCI group were specific and restricted to brain regions such as the right supramarginal gyrus and right angular gyrus, which is consistent with the findings of the present study (Shang et al.,  ). Notably, there was a high degree of overlap between the activated brain regions involved in the acupuncture treatment of MCI in the current study and the brain regions where the pain occurred (Henderson et al.,  ; Christidi et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). Previous studies have demonstrated that pain processing disorders are often present in patients with cognitive impairment and that various forms and degrees of dementia can affect pain processing (Cole et al.,  ; Kunz et al.,  ,  ; Jensen-Dahm et al.,  ; Defrin et al.,  ; Beach et al.,  ). A study on pain processing in MCI and its relationship to executive function and memory showed a strong association between pain response and executive function in MCI patients, meaning that poorer executive function was associated with pain onset and escalation (Lautenbacher et al.,  ). This also demonstrates to some extent that the modulatory effect of acupuncture on the brain regions of MCI may also have a modulatory effect on the brain regions of pain, providing a good idea for the multi-target disease treatment of acupuncture. \n\n\n### Basic characteristics of research on acupuncture for MCI \n  \nOf the seven studies included, all were from China, which may be because acupuncture is more popular and widely accepted in Chinese society but can cause language bias. The small sample size of between 22\u201364 cases per study may be due to the limitations of MRI trials on sample size. Because many functional MRI studies are small and performed at a single site, meta-analyses are thought to help improve the accuracy of results and generalize conclusions from individual studies (Cohn and Decker,  ). Although the field has studied the optimal sample size needed to detect or evaluate experimental factors, the number of subjects is often limited by practical constraints such as scanning time and cost (Desmond and Glover,  ; Murphy and Garavan,  ; Mumford and Nichols,  ). However, too small a sample size may lead to excessive random errors and make the study results more heterogeneous. Estimates of effect sizes, between-and within-subject variance, and temporal autocorrelation matrices should be added to reduce subject bias's adverse effects on study results (Guo et al.,  ). \n\nRegarding the choice of specific acupuncture modalities, manual acupuncture (MA) and electroacupuncture (EA) are the most common methods used to treat MCI. According to the theory of acupuncture, the stimulation of MA comes from specific finger manipulation that drives the translation, rotation, or tremor of the needle (Dilts et al.,  ). Electroacupuncture works by setting up electrical stimulation at specific points on the body, thereby activating these neural networks and regulating the function of certain organs (Ulloa,  ). With these two modalities, specific neural network modulation of brain regions can be achieved in MCI patients. LR3 is located between the first and second metatarsal bones on the dorsal side of the foot, in the anterior depression of the metatarsal union, and is part of the Jueyin Liver Meridian of Foot. The K13 point is located on the medial side of the foot, in the depression between the back of the inner ankle and the tendon of the heel bone, and is part of the Shaoyin Kidney Meridian of Foot. Recent studies have shown that acupuncture LR3 and K13 play a positive activating role in social behavior and decision-making in MCI (Chen et al.,  ). Among the single duration and duration of acupuncture treatment, only one study mentioned that the duration of acupuncture treatment should be 40 min, and most of the studies used a block design to observe the immediate effects of acupuncture. Acupuncture of LR3 and K13 specifically regulates blood flow and activates brain regions associated with emotion, decision making, semantic processing, memory, attention, and sensation. Three studies used only one acupuncture point for treatment, while others combined multiple acupuncture points for MCI. Studies suggest that the combination of acupuncture points may produce novel central effects. Comparison of LR3 plus KI3 acupuncture vs. LR3 alone revealed that ALFF alterations were concentrated in BA6, BA10, BA24, BA32, the posterior cerebellum lobe, and inferior semilunar lobule regions of the brain (Zhang et al.,  ). Studying the combined LR3 and KI3 acupuncture patterns with the relationship between LR3 and KI3 acupoint patterns and regional activation in the brain will be important in the future. \n\n\n### Study design \n  \nThe rigorous and scientific clinical trial design is essential to observe the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. A rigorous and scientific clinical trial design is essential to observe the efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention. In this study, three clinical trial designs including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cross-sectional studies, and longitudinal studies were included, and the results of the meta-analysis of brain images between different study designs were also presented. RCTs are considered the highest level of evidence to establish causal associations in clinical research (Zabor et al.,  ). Limitations in the case-control study design used in most clinical fMRI studies tend to raise questions as to how samples are drawn and matched to potentially confounding variables (Carter et al.,  ). In contrast, only one of the original studies we included was an RCT, and most were cross-sectional studies. Currently, the application of MRI modalities has shown promising results in cross-sectional studies of neurodegenerative diseases (Argiris et al.,  ). However, in studies related to cognitive function, cross-sectional showed differences in outcomes between cross-sectional and longitudinal, as aptly demonstrated by the results of the meta-analysis in this study (Salthouse,  ). \n\nIn most of our studies, the control group was healthy individuals, and only three studies used the placebo group as a control group. Randomized controlled trials with placebo control groups have high internal validity and are considered a reliable method for assessing treatment effects (G\u00f8tzsche,  ; Walach and Loef,  ). The long time required for MRI acquisition resulted in the inability to set up a placebo control group due to the non-participation of many potential subjects, ultimately creating a potential bias (Carter et al.,  ). In this study, a placebo control group was set up for sham acupuncture. Sham acupuncture (SA), also known as a placebo, may be considered a sham intervention because it is based on non-acupuncture points. \u201cSham acupuncture\u201d controls, in which needles are inserted at wrong points or non-points, which deliberately violate traditional acupuncture theories of point locations or indications and are therefore predicted to be incapable of achieving the outcomes intended by true acupuncture (Moffet,  ). In clinical trials, the placebo control group should be consistent with the treatment group at baseline, except for physiological inertia (Chae,  ). Currently, relevant validation focuses only on the blinding and credibility of the interventions, and few studies have validated the physiological inertia of these sham interventions. Sham acupuncture has a non-inert character, which can cause the public to question its actual effectiveness. In addition, in acupuncture trials, the key to distinguishing between acupuncture and sham acupuncture is the presence or absence of the sensory stimulus of \u201cgetting qi\u201d. Data from imaging studies also suggest that expectation, learning, and contextual factors play an important role in the placebo effect (Enck et al.,  ; Wager and Atlas,  ; Geuter et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Experimental designs of MRI \n  \nThe rs-fMRI and the task-state fMRI are the two primary paradigms for functional MRI studies. In the experimental design of MRI on acupuncture, rs-fMRI is the closest to the response of brain activity in the actual state, while task-state fMRI reflects the persistent effect of acupuncture. In the present study, a non-repeated event-related block design was mainly used, in which the inserted needles were continuously stimulated for 30 s to 2 min before the scan to observe the immediate effects of acupuncture. According to TCM theory, acupuncture produces a sustained effect, even after 30 min of retention, with corresponding neural responses, so NRER is more consistent with the MRI experimental design of acupuncture (Cho et al.,  ; Bai et al.,  ,  ). They also can reduce interference from the persistent effect of acupuncture that occurs when a single, prolonged acupuncture stimulation is given during the scanning process (Liu et al.,  ). However, this type of experiment usually selects single acupuncture point, which has the limitation of single stimulation to some extent, and the clinical treatment for MCI usually uses multiple acupuncture points. \n\nIn recent years, rs-fMRI has provided new research perspectives on the central mechanisms of acupuncture treatment. By observing the changes in ReHo\/ALFF after acupuncture, the changes in brain function after acupuncture treatment are analyzed, and such changes are more reflected as long-term cumulative effects. In addition, in recent years, rs-fMRI imaging has been increasingly used to explore the central mechanisms of acupuncture treatment, such as pain, migraine, and stroke (Lan et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Leung et al.,  ). Therefore, future studies should focus on the experimental design of rs-fMRI as a way to observe the long-lasting therapeutic effects of acupuncture on MCI in the real world. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough this review provides an SDM-PSI-based meta-analysis of current MRI studies of acupuncture for MCI, there are still some limitations. First, all of the literature that met the inclusion criteria was conducted in China in this study. The language of publication included only Chinese and English, which may lead to potential publication bias and reduce the applicability and readability of this study. Although our search strategy appears to be comprehensive, the possibility of relevant literature appearing in other databases cannot be excluded. The high level of the review emphasizes the need for multi-center studies that especially considering the apparent heterogeneity of social backgrounds between countries (Ewers et al.,  ). Future studies should consider the need for multicenter studies in which language, country, region, and other influencing factors are taken into account to expand treatment coverage. Second, due to the small sample size of the included studies, there is significant heterogeneity between studies in terms of acupuncture point selection, clinical protocol design, and analytical methods, which significantly reduces the credibility of the findings. Given the financial burden and additional limitations of neuroimaging studies, small samples are standard, which can lead to low statistical power and may obscure essential results that may be clinically significant (Moayedi et al.,  ). Therefore, more rigorous randomized controlled trials with large samples should be designed to avoid confounding factors and methodological bias in future clinical trials. \n\nIn order to make the findings more reproducible and accurate and to precisely elucidate the mechanisms of brain region regulation in acupuncture for MCI, larger sample sizes of RCTs are needed in the future. When designing and reporting MRI for acupuncture studies, investigators should follow the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines (MacPherson et al.,  ). Standardized clinical treatment protocols should be developed around six regions: the theoretical rationale for acupuncture, details of acupuncture measures, treatment protocols, ancillary interventions, acupuncturist credentials, and control interventions. Third, most of the studies did not specify the specific implementation of blinding and allocation concealment in the clinical trial design, which exposes the results to a certain degree of risk of methodological bias. In addition, most of the studies had healthy controls, making it difficult to exclude the placebo effect of acupuncture or other factors from interfering. Future studies should design rigorous scientific RCTs with sham acupuncture placebo controls to increase the reliability of MRI mechanism studies. In subsequent clinical designs, the design of sham acupuncture groups should be standardized, and more standard implementation guidelines should be adopted for appliance selection, baseline patient characteristics, and effect determination to maximize the actual therapeutic effect of acupuncture (Birch et al.,  ). Fourth, adverse events during acupuncture treatment and MRI acquisition were not reported in any studies. We suggest that in future studies and reporting on the primary outcome, clinical changes and adverse events during treatment should be monitored simultaneously to provide comprehensive standardized clinical guidelines for neuroimaging studies. \n\n\n### Future outlook of acupuncture for MCI \n  \nEarly screening for MCI is generally performed through cognitive assessments, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), MMSE, etc (Gauthier et al.,  ). However, the accuracy of MCI diagnosis is compromised by the highly subjective nature of cognitive assessment and its low sensitivity to early identification of MCI and dementia. Some studies in which neuroimaging may help determine the etiology and prognosis of MCI suggest that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Fludeoxyglucose PET, and other neuroimaging may help identify people with MCI and those at high risk of progressing from MCI to dementia (Langa and Levine,  ). Most recently, PET imaging of the extent of A\u03b2 plaques in the brain has become more feasible with the radiopharmaceutical tracer florbetapir (Clark et al.,  ). Currently, amyloid A (Chen et al.,  ). Likewise, the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture can be evaluated similarly. In addition to the use of MRI to investigate the central mechanisms of acupuncture, quantitative analysis of efficacy can be performed using biomarkers based on PET technology. In addition, indicators of cognitive function, functional status, medications, neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, and laboratory tests are combined to distinguish MCI from normal aging or dementia and identify possible forms of mild cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. Older adults fear cognitive decline, and most patients prefer testing that would indicate future Alzheimer's disease risk (Wikler et al.,  ). Clinical prediction and management of MCI may become a hot topic in the future as diagnostic techniques change. Recently, Yang et al. developed a clinical prediction model for acupuncture treatment in patients recovering from stroke under different conditions by standardizing acupuncture treatment in 1,410 patients recovering from a stroke, combined with CART decision tree analysis, to provide a tool for predicting the effect of acupuncture treatment (Burge et al.,  ). Regarding the prediction model of MCI, the current research directions are primarily focused on the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. For example, Huang et al., based on the Least Absolute contraction and Selection Operator (LASSO), which provides a personalized MCI to AD, found significant associations between neuropsychological scores, cortical features, A\u03b2 levels, and underlying genetic pathways (Huang et al.,  ). The above study shows that the establishment of a neuroimaging-based prediction model can guide clinical diagnosis and provide an objective reference for the assessment of the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of MCI and contribute to the development of personalized treatment. In addition, the prediction of acupuncture response can reduce the medical costs for patients identified as likely non-responders. Future research can start from the prediction model of acupuncture for MCI and integrate machine learning algorithms better to explain the neuroimaging mechanism of acupuncture for MCI. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA ReHo-based meta-analysis showed that acupuncture has potential modulatory effects on MCI in brain regions, suggesting that the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus, right insula, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus, right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, and right middle temporal gyrus may be the precise brain region response targets of acupuncture for MCI. In particular, activity was significantly increased in the left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyrus and the right insula. The MCI group showed stronger activity in the right supramarginal gyrus after acupuncture treatment compared to healthy controls. The above study provides a new perspective to elucidate the role of brain region modulation in acupuncture for MCI. In the future, guidelines and procedures should be followed to conduct large-scale rigorous randomized controlled trials to ensure the validity of future clinical evidence. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nSM and HH designed the entire study and wrote the manuscript.

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is an advanced imaging technique that can be used to monitor changes in the activity of the brain, particularly in PDPN. However, the data from several studies remain inconclusive and there is currently no systematic review and meta-analysis for the use of rs-fMRI in PDPN. \n\n\n## Methods and analysis \n  \nIn this study, we will select all eligible studies published on or before 30 June 2021.

Only clinical trials and the first cycle of a cross-over trial linked to acupuncture for PDPN will be included in the analysis. The main outcomes include the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, functional connectivity of the brain, bilateral superficial peroneal nerve sensory nerve conduction velocity, bilateral dorsal current perception threshold values and the degree of subjective pain. The secondary outcomes include biochemical indicators, the degree of depression and anxiety and changes in efficiency.

It is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) and occurs in 46.6% of patients with diabetes in China.  Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a disease for which there are currently no effective treatments and has a major impact on the quality of life of patients with diabetes.  The prevalence of PDPN increases with age.  Around 12% of patients with PDPN do not report significant symptoms and 39% of patients do not receive any treatment.  The main clinical manifestations of PDPN are numbness, tingling and abnormal sensations mostly in the lower extremities and increased pain at night. More than two-thirds of patients with PDPN suffer from varying degrees of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders  resulting in a major societal burden on families and caregivers. The latest research data have shown that diabetes and its complications are also important risk factors for the progression and adverse outcomes of patients with COVID-19. \n\nThe pathogenesis of PDPN is complex involving metabolic disorders, vascular damage, neurological damage, oxidative stress damage and the inflammatory response. Although poor control of blood glucose is the most important cause of PDPN, its exact aetiology remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that peripheral and central sensitisation play an important role in the onset and progression of PDPN.  Peripheral sensitisation involves the hypersensitisation of primary injury receptor neurons resulting in an enhanced nociceptive response to normal pain-causing stimuli. In contrast, central sensitisation refers to the amplification of the response of the spinal cord and the central nervous system above the spinal cord to pain transmission. Central sensitisation is evidenced by the expansion of the receptive field, enhanced response to stimuli, prolongation of the duration and lowering of the pain threshold. It has been shown that dysfunction of the descending pain modulation system mediated by the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey-mediated may reflect a brain-based pain promotion mechanism leading to PDPN.  Therefore, this deleterious injury should be addressed early to prevent the continued exacerbation of neurological complications. \n\nThe pathogenesis of PDPN remains unclear and so it is difficult for modern medicine to develop improved treatment options for PDPN. Approaches such as control of blood glucose, nerve nutrition and pain treatment can be used but often deliver unsatisfactory outcomes.  Pain associated with PDPN is often treated with tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, promethazine and nortriptyline), 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, griseofulvin), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin) and opioids. However, only duloxetine and pregabalin are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PDPN.  Although a variety of drugs are available for the treatment of PDPN, none has been shown to provide 100% effective relief from symptoms and are also associated with significant adverse side effects. \n\nAcupuncture is an important component of traditional Chinese medicine that has demonstrated significant advantages in the treatment of PDPN.  Acupuncture involves the transmission of information through body surface stimulation to the brain center for integration and processing which in turn outputs instructions that regulate the neuroendocrine\u2013immune system and overall body function.  Acupuncture has been shown to improve the state of the body and can be used to treat many diseases. Studies have shown that acupuncture can significantly improve pain in patients with PDPN by reducing their symptoms of burning and tingling sensations, numbness and heterogeneous pain.  Acupuncture is a complex intervention and while some small-sample randomised controlled clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PDPN, the specific mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to study neurological disorders as it assesses the activity of the central nervous system. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) is a validated rs-fMRI analysis method that can be used to assess the neuronal activity of the brain by measuring the low-frequency oscillation (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal.  Regional homogeneity (ReHo) is a method that allows local correlations in the BOLD signal to reveal regional synchronisations of temporal changes in BOLD.  Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis is also used to investigate abnormal FC between areas of the brain in the PDPN. Studies have evaluated abnormal brain activity in patients with diabetic neuropathy treated with acupuncture using ALFF, ReHo and FC yet these studies have reported inconclusive findings.  Moreover, previous studies on acupuncture for PDPN have been focused on changes in the spinal level rather than the central level due to the limitations of research techniques. Recently, rapid developments in rs-fMRI technology have allowed it to be widely used to investigate changes in brain function changes in a variety of diseases. We hypothesise that this technique could be successfully applied to investigate changes in the brain in the treatment of PDPN with acupuncture. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study registration \n  \nThis study is registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PROSPERO) and is reported in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocol statement guidelines. \n\n\n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nNo patient involved. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria for collection of studies \n  \n#### Type of studies \n  \nThe review will include all clinical trials to investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDPN based on rs-fMRI using ALFF, ReHo or FC as the main outcomes. The right anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey will be defined as region of interest for FC.  Other experiments, such as non-clinical trials, non-controlled trials will not be included. \n\n\n#### Type of participants \n  \nThis analysis will include studies on adult patients 18 years of age or older who have been diagnosed with PDPN according to the diagnostic criteria from the WHO, the American Diabetes Association and the diagnostic criteria for DPN from the International Association for Pain Research. No constraints will be placed on regional data, educational background, race and gender. \n\n\n#### Type of interventions \n  \nPatients in the treatment group will be given acupuncture without restrictions on the needle content, choice of treatment point, mode of procedure, the retention time of the needle and course of treatment. Interventions without stimulating acupoints combined with two or more therapies or with potential safety problems will be excluded. \n\n\n#### Type of outcomes \n  \n##### Main outcomes \n  \nThe main outcomes will include the ALFF, ReHo, FC of the brain, superficial peroneal nerve sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV), bilateral dorsal current perception threshold (CPT) values of the first toe, the Michigan Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Screening Inventory (MNSI), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), the Leeds Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms Score (LANSS), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. \n\n\n##### Secondary outcomes \n  \nThe secondary outcomes for the study will be fasting glucose, serum C-peptide, blood lipids, glycated serum protein and the depression and anxiety status of the patients with PDPN. \n\n\n\n\n### Search strategies for recognising studies \n  \n#### Electronic searches \n  \nWe will search articles in electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang database, China Science Technology Journal Database (VIP) and the China Doctor\/Master Dissertations Full-text Database. All the publications to 30 June 2021 will be searched. Also, by searching the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov, we will retrieve unpublished protocols and overview findings. Our approach uses a combination of subject and free words and will be decided after several pre-searches. At the same time, the original literature of all the study references will be searched to supplement and obtain relevant literature and ensure a high recovery rate. An example of the search strategy for the Medical Search Headings that will be used is presented in  . For Chinese databases, Chinese translations of these search terms will be used. This approach will adapt and incorporate similar search techniques for other electronic databases. \n  \nSearch strategy in PubMed (MEDLINE) \n    \n\n#### Other search methods \n  \nSpecific conference papers will be manually retrieved and the experts in the field will contact the corresponding authors to obtain valuable information that cannot be accessed by the above data retrieval process. \n\n\n\n### Data acquisition and analysis \n  \n#### Selection of studies \n  \nBefore reviewing the studies, researchers will discuss and decide the screening criteria for the community. The corresponding study members will import the retrieved studies for repetition elimination into the EndNote V.X9 content management system. Ineligible studies will be excluded by reading the titles and abstracts. The final included studies will be determined by reading the full text and discussing the study within the group and contacting the authors for more details if required. Information retrieval and literature screening will be conducted independently by two study members. In cases of disagreement, a third party will be consulted to assess if the study should be included in the final analysis. A description of the selection process is presented in the PRISMA flowchart shown in  . \n  \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of the study process. \n  \n\n\n### Data acquisition and management \n  \n#### Extraction of the research background and design information \n  \nTwo reviewers will extract the following details based on a pre-designed data extraction form before data collection: details of the research (name of the first author, year of publication, if it is a multicentre study), details of participants (baseline data, gender, age, PDPN diagnostic criteria, exclusion criteria), methods of study (sample size, distribution hiding, blinding), treatment and control group intervention methods and the primary and secondary outcomes (ALFF, ReHo, FC, SCV, CPT, MNSI, NPSI, LANSS, BPI, fasting glucose, serum C-peptide, blood lipids, glycated serum protein, depression and anxiety status, as well as follow-up duration and adverse events). Any differences will be discussed and consulted through an experienced third party. \n\n\n#### Quality control for fMRI data \n  \nThe relative head movement of the subjects will be <2\u2009mm, the time of all functional data included in the study will be >6\u2009min and all functional data included in the study will be smoothed. All data preprocessing included in the study must be registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space template. All of the included studies must provide information such as the equipment model, magnetic field strength, voxel size, field of view, repetition time and echo time. \n\n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies \n  \nThe risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Method,  which focuses on selection (including random sequence generation and allocation concealment), implementation (including blinding of researchers and subjects), evaluation (blinded study outcomes assessment), follow-up (competence of outcome data), reporting (selective study outcomes reporting) and other sources of bias. For a total of seven entries in six fields, the probability of bias will be assessed (other sources of bias). Based on the risk of bias evaluation criteria, \u2018low risk of bias\u2019, \u2018high risk of bias\u2019 and \u2018unclear\u2019 will be calculated for each entry. Review Manager statistical software (RevMan) V.5.4 will produce a graphical presentation of the risk evaluation of bias. \n\n\n### Measures of treatment effects \n  \nFor continuous variable results, we will report the mean difference (MD) or standardised MD at the 95% CI. We will report the relative risk and 95%\u2009CI for dichotomous outcomes. \n\n\n### Dealing with missing data \n  \nIn the case of studies where data are missing, the researcher will attempt to obtain information by contacting the corresponding author of the study. We will build our research on the available data if communication is unsuccessful. \n\n\n### Data synthesis and analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.4 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Before the meta-analysis for effects is performed, we will examine heterogeneity in the data. A standard \u03c7  test with a significance level of p<0.10\u2009will be used to detect heterogeneity. To measure discrepancies across studies and to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity in meta-analyses, the I  statistics will be used.  I  values of 0%\u201330% indicate low heterogeneity, 30%\u201350% indicate medium heterogeneity and values \u226550% indicate high heterogeneity. When the data are highly heterogeneous, subgroup analysis will be performed and the reasons for the heterogeneity will be explained. A fixed-effects model will be used for meta-analysis when no statistical heterogeneity is observed between the results. The source of heterogeneity will be further analysed when statistical heterogeneity is detected in the results and after excluding the effects of significant clinical heterogeneity, a meta-analysis will be performed using a random-effects model. \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nIf necessary, the data will be analysed in groups according to different factors such as differences in the acupuncture method, frequency of treatment and the follow-up time. \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nSensitivity analysis will be used to assess the stability of the meta-analysis results based on the following criteria: study quality, sample size, missing data, quality of heterogeneity, and statistical model. \n\n\n### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThe systematic review and meta-analysis will be based on published literature for data extraction and will not include the use of individual patient data and so no ethical approval is required. The results from this study will be disseminated through conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDM is a severe metabolic condition characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia and is one of the primary causes of peripheral neuropathy.  Approximately 50%\u201360% of patients with DPN have recurrent pain.  Usually, a stocking-glove pattern that progresses proximally from the feet and hands induces burning pain, paresthesia and numbness. Also, sleep deprivation and depression commonly affect patients with PDPN.  The symptoms associated with PDPN have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can effectively improve the clinical symptoms of PDPN. In this scenario, acupuncture is a simple and convenient treatment method that has no adverse side effects as so acupuncture therapy is widely used to treat PDPN and improve the quality of life of patients. \n\nRecently, MRI and other brain imaging modalities have demonstrated utility as non-invasive tools to evaluate changes occurring in the brain. The simultaneous development of modern information science and technology in multimodal data fusion and processing analysis methods has shown that brain imaging may play an increasingly important role in revealing the pathogenesis and central mechanisms of PDPN. Rs-fMRI is widely used to study the mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of neurological diseases. ALFF and ReHo are neuroimaging analysis methods used to measure spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD-fMRI signal intensity for a given region in the resting brain.  Changes in ALFF and ReHo can be used to locate the spontaneous neural activities in specific regions and the physiological state of the brain. FC can reveal the key roles and regulatory influences on the activity of the target brain area of the entire network. Correlation analysis can be used to calculate the relationship between the average ALFF, ReHo and FC in the changing area of the brain in patients with PDPN and their clinical characteristics. These parameters can reveal the central effect mechanism of acupuncture. \n\nDespite evidence from clinical and animal studies, the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDPN has not been elaborated in detail. Furthermore, there has been no systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of this area. In addition to evaluating the improvement of acupuncture treatment for PDPN pain, this study will also explore the latest literature on the mechanism of acupuncture treatment for PDPN. However, there are a relatively small number of studies related to this area of research and our study has some limitations. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to elaborate the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDPN and will provide a reliable clinical research basis for promoting acupuncture in its treatment. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8388266,"text_md5":"191fbdcaf759c1f6dfe8babe904dfe3b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,128],"journal":[129,137],"publication_year":[139,143],"title":[154,302],"keywords":[316,421],"abstract":[434,2472],"body":[2481,21040]},"batch":2,"pmid":34433612,"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2021-055874","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8388266","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8388266"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8388266\">8388266<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8388266  Study on acupuncture in the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on rs-fMRI: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis"}

The CluB toolbox permits both to extract a set of spatially coherent clusters of activations from a database of stereotactic coordinates, and to explore each single cluster of activation for its composition according to the cognitive dimensions of interest. This last step, called \u201ccluster composition analysis,\u201d permits to explore neurocognitive effects by adopting a factorial-design logic and by testing the working hypotheses using either asymptotic tests, or exact tests either in a classic inference, or in a Bayesian-like context. To perform our validation study, we selected the fMRI data from 24 normal controls involved in a reading task. We run a standard random-effects second level group analysis to obtain a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of reference. In a second step, the subject-specific reading effects (i.e., the linear t-contrast \u201creading > baseline\u201d) were extracted to obtain a coordinates-based database that was used to run a meta-analysis using both CluB and the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation method implemented in the software GingerALE. The results of the two meta-analyses were compared against the \u201cGold Standard\u201d to compute performance measures, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The GingerALE method obtained a high level of accuracy (0.967) associated with a high sensitivity (0.728) and specificity (0.971). The CluB method obtained a similar level of accuracy (0.956) and specificity (0.969), notwithstanding a lower level of sensitivity (0.14) due to the lack of prior Gaussian transformation of the data. Finally, the two methods obtained a good-level of concordance (AC  = 0.93). These results suggested that methods based on hierarchical clustering (and   post-hoc   statistics) and methods requiring prior Gaussian transformation of the data can be used as complementary tools, with the GingerALE method being optimal for neurofunctional mapping of pooled data according to simpler designs, and the CluB method being preferable to test more specific, and localized, neurocognitive hypotheses according to factorial designs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Highlights \n    \n- We report a new method for coordinate-based meta-analysis of brain imaging data. \n  \n- We describe the software implementation of the method called CluB\u2014Clustering the Brain. \n  \n- The CluB method is based on hierarchical clustering of stereotactic coordinates. \n  \n- The CluB method allows for quantitative characterization of the cognitive dimensions. \n  \n- A formal comparison between CluB and GingerALE is performed. \n  \n\n## Introduction \n  \n### Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Data: the Past \n  \nIn the past decades there has been an explosive growth in the use of neuroimaging techniques to explore the neurofunctional correlates of cognitive functions, such as memory, language, action and motor planning, as well as the neurofunctional and neuromorphometrical changes that characterize the life-cycle of neurological and psychiatric pathologies. \n\nIndeed, while in 2000 only 9,334 fMRI papers were published, in 2017  about 19,178 appeared in the international peer-reviewed literature. This \u201cscientific boom\u201d produced such a huge amount of empirical evidence that sometimes it can be easy to lose one's bearings. This issue becomes even more problematic when it is necessary to translate this type of experimental findings in the clinical practice, i.e., in what has been called translational medicine. For example, more than 40 papers used the voxel-based morphometry to identify the pattern of brain atrophy typically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the most of them reported a significant decrement of the gray matter density within the hippocampal formation and the medial temporal lobe regions. This finding had become so stable in the international literature, and it has been replicated with several neuroimaging   in-vivo   and   post-mortem   investigations, that the presence of documented hippocampal volumetric reductions had been included in the revised clinical criteria for the diagnosis of probable AD since 2007 (Dubois et al.,  ; McKhann et al.,  ). This is to suggest that neuroimaging studies represent an important source of evidence not only for basic cognitive neuroscience, but also for the treatment and management of psychiatric, neurological and neuropsychological deficits. In such a translational perspective, it is self-evident that the development of rigorous statistical methods to \u201csum-up\u201d large amount of data represents an important milestone for cognitive and clinical neuroscience. \n\nIn the past, let's say before the 2000, the most common approach to pool together the neuroimaging data coming from different studies was based on merging the activation foci (i.e., the stereotactic coordinates corresponding to fMRI activations) reported in several independent experiments into a table (see, for example, D\u00e9monet et al.,  ; Cabeza and Nyberg,  ) or a summary picture (see for example, Berlingeri et al.,  ). In these cases, the evaluation of the between-studies concordance was completely subjective: the scientist that was taking the responsibility to review the literature had to decide whether a certain brain region was consistently associated with either a specific task, or a specific cognitive dimension, either on the basis of the spatial proximity between the activation peaks reported in the figure, or exploring the spatial contiguity of the anatomical labels reported in the table, without, however, applying any kind of objective data-driven statistic method. Although valuable, these studies cannot be referred to as meta-analyses due to their level of subjectivity, and now they can be rather considered like \u201cillustrated reviews.\u201d \n\nTo overcome these limitations, in the past years several new computerized methods designed to classify the neuroimaging data reported in the literature have been developed. \n\nHistorically, Goutte et al. ( ) were the first to use hierarchical clustering to perform meta-analyses of neuroimaging data: in their initial paper entitled \u201cFeature-Space Clustering for fMRI Meta-Analysis\u201d they suggested that clustering algorithms could be adopted to pull-together the fMRI results reported in the literature: \u201c  An investigator interested in comparing methods would typically produce activation maps for the different analyses and find some kind of consensus by identifying regions that \u2018activate in the same way' on the different maps. The proposed meta-clustering method is a way of automating this process\u201d   (Goutte et al.,  ; page 170). \n\nHierarchical clustering has become a relatively popular meta-analytical method for some time: even though it is less used than other methods (see below) it has been the basis of some with well-cited papers (e.g., Jobard et al.,  ; Salvador et al.,  ; Shehzad et al.,  ; Liakakis et al.,  ) and a method of choice of our group (Cattinelli et al.,  ; Crepaldi et al.,  ; Paulesu et al.,  ; Zapparoli et al.,  ; Devoto et al.,  ). \n\nOther methods for meta-analysis have rapidly appeared in the literature: the highly popular Activation Likelihood Estimates (ALE) technique (Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ), with more that 300 papers easily identified on MEDLINE; the multilevel kernel density analysis\u2014MKDA\u2014method of Wager et al. ( ) or the signed differential mapping approach (Radua et al.,  ). \n\nIt is worth noting that the description of the pros and cons associated with each single method goes beyond the specific aims of this paper: excellent such reviews can be found elsewhere (see, for example, Wager et al.,  ). Recommendations on best practices when performing meta-analyses are described in M\u00fcller et al. ( ). \n\nIn this paper we propose a revival and an in depth examination of the hierarchical clustering approach of brain imaging data in its implementation with a software package that we called CluB (from Clustering the Brain). From the presentation of the method, it will become apparent the specific situations where CluB offers a more flexible approach to data that can be framed according to factorial designs. As the reader shall see, CluB also offers a region-of-interest oriented interrogation of the data that may appeal to investigators with specific anatomically constrained hypotheses. \n\n\n### Clustering Algorithms for Meta-Analyses and the Problem of Non-uniqueness of the Clustering Solution \n  \nThe basic idea underlying clustering algorithms is to group elements into subsets, called clusters, according to some homogeneity measure, so that objects inside a cluster are more similar among them, and more dissimilar from objects belonging to other clusters. In the literature several clustering methods had been developed; among these, hierarchical clustering (HC) is one of the most widely used as it has been proved to be a flexible method that can be applied to bioinformatics data (Sturn et al.,  ), medical data (Makretsov et al.,  ; Whitwell et al.,  ), and neuroimaging data (Cordes et al.,  ), for example. In what follows we briefly describe the overall logic underlying a classic HC procedure to introduce the problem of \u201cnon-uniqueness\u201d (Cattinelli et al.,  ). In classic HC a progressive partitioning of the data elements is achieved by iterative operations: at start, each single element represents a different cluster (partition S1) and step-by-step, two clusters are merged according to a dissimilarity measure and a new data partition is generated. The procedure is repeated iteratively to obtain a final partition containing a single cluster that includes all the clusters of the S1 partition. As a result, a hierarchy of nested clustering solutions is obtained. This solution can be represented in a tree-like structure called dendrogram ( ). The final pool of clusters, hence called the clustering solution, is obtained by cutting the dendrogram at a certain level according to what has been called \u201c  the user's spatial criterion  \u201d (i.e., the user decides the amount of global variability that is acceptable for the specific scientific issue of interest; in what follows we will better specify this term). \n  \nHierarchical clustering dendrogram and dissimilarity matrix.   (A)   Example of a hierarchical clustering dendrogram. The initial dataset of peaks is represented on the x-axis. On the y-axis are represented the spatial thresholds that can be selected by the users to let the clustering solution emerge. For example, the red dotted line shows the clustering solution for a user's spatial criterion = 6 mm.   (B)   Example of a dissimilarity matrix. In each cell of the matrix is represented the difference of error sum of squares (\u0394ESS) between different clusters. \n  \nWithin the clustering procedure described above, the user can play a role at different levels: \n  \ns\/he can decide the dissimilarity measure to be adopted \n  \ns\/he can set up the user's spatial criterion \n  \nLet's start with the first source of \u201csubjectivity\u201d within a clustering procedure: the choice of the dissimilarity measure. It is worthy to note that several \u201cbetween-clusters dissimilarity measures\u201d had been proposed in the literature, like for example the single linkage and Ward's method (Xu and Wunsch,  ). In particular, the Ward's method aims at partitioning the data by minimizing the loss of information associated with each cluster. Thus, at each step the union of every possible cluster pair is considered and the two clusters whose fusion results in the minimum increase of the information loss are combined. Ward defines information loss in terms of an error sum-of-squares criterion (ESS) according to the Equation (1): \n\nWhere   C   is one of the clusters in the partition   S   obtained at step   l  :   S   =   (C   , C   , \u2026 C   )  , \u03bc  represents the centroid of the cluster   C   and   x   is one of the element included in cluster   C  . In general, at step   l   the error sum-of-squares for the generic cluster   C   (  ESS  ) is calculated according to Equation (1) and to obtain the minimum information loss, the measure to be minimized is \n\nWhere   ESS   is the error sum-of-squares of the new cluster obtained by merging   C   and   C   at step   l   +   1  . The total cluster error sum of squares   ESS  , i.e., the total amount of variability within our partition is given by Equation (3): \n\nWhere   ESS   is obtained according to Equation (1) and   |C|   is the number of clusters obtained at step   l  . The result of these operations is the creation, for each step   l   of the clustering procedure (represented by the level of the dendrogram,  ) of a dissimilarity matrix (see  ): a   |C|-by-|C| symmetric matrix   where the diagonal element is set to 0 (i.e., there is no dissimilarity between a cluster   C   and itself) and the remaining elements correspond to the \u0394  ESS   computed according to Equation (2). Among these, in step   l   +   1   the two clusters with the lowest \u0394  ESS   are merged together. \n\nIt is worth noting that this measure is computed by an iterative procedure that can suffer of a serious, although sometime neglected, problem: the final clustering solution may depend by the order of the data entered in the algorithm (van der Kloot et al.,  ) when the data to be clustered are represented by integer values, as in the case of stereotactic coordinates used in neuroimaging. This means that the same data-set arranged in a different manner could give rise to different clustering solutions due to the presence of ties in the dissimilarity matrix at a given step. In other words, the problem of non-uniqueness in the clustering solution can emerge when the minimum dissimilarity (MD) value (that is minimum value within the pool of possible dissimilarity measures between two clusters) is shared by more than one pair of clusters. \n\nIn order to overcome this problem, Cattinelli et al. ( ) proposed a modified version of the HC that is based on the identification of critical and non-critical MD pairs. A non-critical pair consists of a pair of elements (clusters) that do not share any element with other MD pairs; thus even if they are merged together at different merging sequences, they do not result in different dendrograms. In the Catinelli's algorithm the non-critical pairs are identified and merged together in a random order producing, as a consequence, a single dendrogram that represents the scaffolding structure to build up sets of alternative dendrograms. All the possible alternative dendrograms are grouped into classes of equivalent clustering solutions. Clustering solutions are considered equivalent if, notwithstanding the shapes of the dendrograms diverge in the intermediate step, they do converge in pooling together the same set of data (Cattinelli et al.,  ). The iterative process ends with the creation of all the possible non-equivalent dendrograms (neD). At this stage, different solutions are generated by cutting each dendrogram according to the users' spatial criterion. For each solution \u201c  neD  \u201d a quality measure is computed as follows: \n\nWhere |  C  | is the number of clusters in the solution   neD  ,   n   is the number of elements included in cluster   C  ,   u   is the mean of cluster   C   (i.e., the centroid) and   u   is the grand mean of the data-set   X  . The above formula can be expressed also as: \n\nWhere   ESS   is the total error sum of squares (3) and   ESS   is the within-clusters error sum-of-squares computed at (1). \n\nAmong the   neD   solutions, the best one is the solution that maximizes the   bESS  ; as the maximization of this measure favors a better spatial separation between clusters. This is the clustering method that is implemented as a collection of MATLAB 2016b (MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2016b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) functions in CluB to perform coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data. The entire algorithm and the MATLAB script associated are available at the webpage:  . \n\n\n### Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Data: Methodological Considerations \n  \nData pooling is critical for establishing the reproducibility and the meaningful convergence of empirical evidence about functions and the structures in the human brain across life-span and pathologies. To pursue this aim, two different classes of strategies are available: (i) creating open shared databases of raw neuroimaging data; (ii) pooling together the positive findings reported in peer-review scientific literature. While the first solution would be the optimal one and the most desirable from the scientific and methodological point of view, only few attempts have been made so far (see for example ADNI:  , fRMIDC:  , Human Connectome Project:  , NeuroVault:  , OASIS brains:  , Open Neuro:  , OpenfMRI:  , SchizConnect:  ) and nowadays the creation of open-source databases is still far from being the norm. \n\nAlternatively, it is possible to pool together the results of multiple data-sets by collecting the information reported in the peer-review literature and in particular, by collecting the stereotactic coordinates (x, y, z) that correspond either to significant activations, or to structural changes in specific samples. This collection of processes represents the basic steps of the \u201ccoordinate-based meta-analysis\u201d (CBMA) methods. Although, CBMAs are now fully accepted in the international literature, some methodological considerations need to be done. The first obvious limitation is that CBMAs are unlikely to be able to reproduce exactly the results of pooled image based meta-analysis (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). This information loss is inevitably due to the relative spatial sparseness of the stereotactic coordinates reported in the different scientific reports. Moreover, one has to consider that there is not a standard rule to report the activation (or structural) peaks in a scientific paper, nor in terms of thresholds applied nor in terms of number of the peaks reported from any given cluster. Indeed, different laboratories adopt different strategies to report their results. Finally, the stereotactic coordinates that emerge from a study depend on a series of methodological choices made by the researcher and in particular, on the selected experimental paradigm, on the selected baseline, on the statistical threshold adopted and on the dimension of the kernel Gaussian filter applied during the smoothing phase. Salimi-Khorshidi et al. ( ) suggest that the adoption of a voxel-wise comparison with an   uncorrected p-value   threshold is the best methodological choice to pool together stereotactic coordinates and to obtain a meta-analytic map similar to the one that we would have obtained by directly pooling together several fMRI (or MRI) data-sets. We took this suggestion to explicitly test our new meta-analytic toolbox by borrowing the \u201cperformance analyses\u201d typically run in clinical studies. \n\n\n### Aim of the Study \n  \nIn what follows we will first describe the CluB toolbox and its components, while in the second part of the paper we will report the results of a validation study for this new meta-analytic method. In particular, we followed this logic: if a CBMA algorithm performs well, than it should be capable of reproducing the effects obtained by pooling together the data in standard random effect group analysis, an approach similar to the one adopted by Salimi-Khorshidi et al. ( ) and that has been further tested and validated in a more recent methodological paper (Maumet and Nichols,  ). \n\nAccordingly, we selected the fMRI data from normal controls involved in words and pseudo-words reading (Danelli et al.,  ). We run standard random effects second level analysis to obtain the pattern of activations associated with words and pseudo-words reading. The results were thresholded at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected and were considered our \u201cGold Standard\u201d reference. In a second step, the subject-specific reading effects (namely the first-level linear contrast \u201creading > baseline\u201d) were extracted at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected and all the activation peaks reported in the SPM table were saved to create a coordinates-based database. Accordingly, each single participant was treated as an independent fMRI study on reading. The coordinates-based database was used to run a meta-analysis using the CluB software and the last version of the GingerALE algorithm (version 2.3.6; Eickhoff et al.,  ). The two meta-analytic results were compared against the Gold Standard to compute performance measures, i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. We choose to compare our software with GingerALE for two simple reasons: (1) GingerALE is the most commonly used software for coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA), (2) GingerALE and CluB are based on completely different assumptions. In fact, while GingerALE is based on the idea that each focus of activation is better represented by a probability distribution and is modeled accordingly, in CluB each activation peak is considered as a single data-point and it is not weighted or modeled any further. This means that if CluB will perform similarly to GingerALE and the two methods will reach a good level of concordance, then we will have a further measure of concurrent validity for the CluB toolbox. \n\n\n\n## CluB\u2014a Detailed Description of the Software \n  \nCluB is designed as a collection of MATLAB functions that can be easily run through a Graphic User Interface (GUI;  ). The GUI is divided into three sections that correspond to the main modules of the software: (a) Spatial transformation, (b) Cluster Analysis, and (c) Cluster Composition Analysis. Each module can be independently run and the entire procedure can be performed in separated MATLAB sessions. The module-specific results are saved in dedicated folders with specific file extensions. In what follows we will briefly describe each single module and the ensuing functions. \n  \nGraphical User Interface (GUI) of the CluB toolbox. Refer to section Introduction of the main text for a more detailed description of the toolbox. \n  \nThe   Spatial Transformation Module   permits to perform the MNI2TAL and the TAL2MNI conversion of the stereotactic coordinates included in the data-input file according to the main algorithms available in the literature (Brett et al.,  ;  ). This preliminary step is necessary to ensure that all the activation peaks (i.e., the stereotactic coordinates) entered in the clustering procedure belong to the same anatomical space. The input file for this procedure is a tab-separated text file (.txt). The data must be entered as a matrix with N rows (as many rows equal to the number of stereotactic coordinates that have to be transformed) and three columns (i.e., the x, y, z distances from the origin of the stereotactic space). As a result, in the working directory, i.e., in the same directory of the input file, a .txt file including the N transformed peaks is saved. This file can be used to refine the entire data-set and obtain a data input made of peaks that are all conforming to the same stereotactic space for the clustering analysis. \n\nThe   Clustering analysis module   is the heart of CluB. This module is based on the modified hierarchical algorithm described in Cattinelli et al. ( ). The algorithm takes into account the squared Euclidean distance between each pair of foci included in the dataset. Then, the clusters with minimal dissimilarity are recursively merged using Ward's criterion (Ward,  ), to minimize the intra-cluster variability and maximizing the between-cluster sum of squares (Cattinelli et al.,  ). To run this analysis, a number of parameters need to be set: \n  \nThe   INPUT   data-file, i.e., a .txt file including the activation peaks reported in the literature together with their \u201ccognitive\u201d characterization (e.g., whether that particular peak was activated either in patients or in healthy subjects, and whether it was activated either in task \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d; see  ). The cognitive characterizations of the tasks\/populations that generated the local effects represented by stereotactic coordinates are reported as numeric factor (i.e., categorical variables in which each number correspond to a level of the factor); \n  \nThe   dissimilarity measure   (at the moment only the Ward's method is implemented); \n  \nThe   user's spatial criterion  , i.e., the maximal spatial variability on average that is acceptable for the specific purpose of the study. It indicates the level at which the algorithm \u201ccuts\u201d the dendrogram ( , dotted line) to obtain a set of clusters. Usually it ranges from 5 to 7.5 mm to resemble the typical spatial resolution of neuroimaging results; \n  \nThe   visual threshold  , i.e., the minimum number of activation peaks included into a cluster\u2014e.g., if it is set to 10, then only the clusters that include at least 10 activation peaks are visualized in the digital image outputs, the clustering-maps; \n  \nThe   peak segregation tool  : this toolbox allows one to run a semantic clustering on neuroimaging meta-analysis datasets. It permits to create specific combinations of regions that will be treated separately by the clustering algorithm and the clustering solution will be constrained within the pre-defined region. This is particularly useful, for example, to avoid that cerebellar data points contribute to occipital clusters or vice-versa. A similar example can be made for the thalamus and nearby basal ganglia, or peaks nearby the mid-sagittal line of the brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The Peaks Segregation ( ) creates groups of brain regions derived from the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template labels (Rorden and Brett,  ). The grouping function distributes the data points in the dataset in several independent groups, as defined with the editor. The clustering function runs the Ward hierarchical clustering algorithm separately on each cluster prepared by the grouping function, obtaining one or more clusters. Then it produces a final result by putting together all the clusters obtained in each group; when necessary, it renames the cluster labels to avoid label collisions; \n  \nThe   edit labels tool  : this is used to edit the labels of the factors that are included in the INPUT data file. In particular, it is possible to attach a name at each factor and to convert each single numbered level of each factor as a string. This passage is useful to obtain a pool of output data files that can be easily read and interpreted; \n    \nInput and output files of the \u201cCluster Analysis\u201d module.   (A)   Example of a dataset in a spreadsheet file.   (B)   Example of an input .txt file. The first three columns represent the x, y, and z coordinates in stereotaxic space, whereas the last four columns represent the categorical factors (F1, F2, F3, and F4). In particular, the number in these columns represents the level of each factor for every peak.   (C)   \u201cCardinality\u201d map representing the number of peaks included in each cluster.   (D)   \u201cDensity\u201d map representing the ratio of the cardinality and the spatial extent of the cluster.   (E)   \u201cCluster Mapping\u201d spreadsheet file in which the anatomical and spatial information about the clusters is stored.   (F)   \u201cPeaks Clustering\u201d spreadsheet file in which each peak is associated with its cluster. \n    \nExample of the \u201cPeaks Segregation\u201d function. The CluB's \u201cPeaks Segregation\u201d module permits to perform a clustering and statistical inference on pre-defined regions or groups of regions taken from the Automatic Anatomical Labeling template (Rorden and Brett,  ). In the figure, a new group of brain regions named \u201cBasalGanglia\u201d has been created (left\u2014\u201cMenage groups\u201d). The list of brain regions included in the group is reported in the middle of the figure (mid-left\u2014\u201cRegions in the selected group\u201d), along with the remaining brain regions (mid-right\u2014\u201cAvailable regions\u201d). This operation will allow CluB to perform the clustering by taking into account the anatomical constraints selected by the user. \n  \nThe   cluster analysis module   produces the following output files: \n  \nA cardinality clustering-map, an ANALYZE file including all the clusters above a specified visualization threshold; in this file, the intensity of the voxel values is determined by the number of peaks included in each cluster C  (see  , for an example); \n\ndensity clustering-map, a ANALYZE file including all the clusters above the visualization threshold; the intensity of the voxel values is determined by the spatial density of each cluster C  (see  , for an example); \n  \nA  ClusterMapping.xls file including the x, y, z of the centroid, the standard deviation along the three axes, the cardinality and the anatomical label of each cluster C  (see  , for an example); \n  \nA  PeaksClustering.xls file including all the activation peaks reported in the input file, the factors that characterize each activation peak, the cluster ID of each peak (see  , for an example); \n  \nA  PeaksCompAnalysis.  cca   (the file extension cca stands for \u201ccluster composition analysis) file containing the aforementioned information in an encrypted format (to prevent casual corruption of the input data) for statistical assessment of the significance of condition specific effects in each cluster. \n  \nThe   cluster composition analysis (CCA) module   represents the most innovative part of the CluB toolbox. This module allows one to assign a \u201cneurocognitive meaning\u201d to each cluster by means of categorical data analyses (see Crepaldi et al.,   and Paulesu et al.,   for practical examples). The results of the tests are saved to dedicated .xls files, which are labeled according to the selected statistical test. \n\nOnce the graphical user interface (GUI) is activated, the statistical tests associated with the cluster composition analysis (CCA) can be set by using the options located in the bottom part of the GUI ( ). \n\nThe CCA GUI includes six sections: (1) the select INPUT option and two text strings to visualize the path and name of the INPUT file, (2) the factors text field, (3) the   binomial test  , (4) the   multinomial test  , (5) the   Fisher's exact test for 2   \u00d7   2 interaction effects  , and (6) the   Mantel  -  Haenszel test for 2   \u00d7   2   \u00d7   2 interactions  . Of note, for each of the previous statistical tests, it is possible to save a map in ANALYZE format that displays only significant clusters, by flagging the option \u201cCCA Map.\u201d \n\nThe cluster composition analysis file (extension .cca) is the source one, as for any other analysis. Once the file has been loaded, the user can select one of the aforementioned tests. One important aspect left to the user's choice is the setting of the prior-likelihood; this can be specified manually or derived from the distribution in the data set for each factor. \n\nBelow we illustrate the statistical tests included in CluB with some examples. The examples were taken from analyses performed on a dataset of peaks created   ad hoc   as example, enclosed in the   (ExampleForFigures.txt). \n\n### Binomial Test \n  \nThe software computes a binomial test within each cluster, the output is saved in a dedicated XLS file: \u201cinput file name\u201d-binomial-\u201ctested factor\u2014tested level(s)\u201d.xls ( ). The result is a matrix with as many rows as the number of clusters. For each cluster the cluster ID, the factor of interest, the category of the successful events (i.e., the level of the factor of interest), the number of observed successes, the cardinality and the   p  -value of the binomial test are displayed. The chosen null and alternative hypotheses are also printed. This would be the test of choice when one wants to evaluate the association of a cluster with one level of a two-levels factor: for example, the comparison of normal and dyslexic readers (Paulesu et al.,  ). \n  \nOutput files of the \u201cCluster Composition Analysis\u201d module and ensuing statistical inferences.   (A)   Output .xls file for a \u201cbinomial test\u201d on the Level B of Factor F1.   (B)   Output .xls file for a \u201cmultinomial test\u201d on Factor F4.   (C)   Output .xls file for a \u201cFisher's test\u201d for 2 \u00d7 2 interaction of the Factors F2 and F3.   (D)   Bar plot generated by the \u201cFisher's test\u201d procedure for 2 \u00d7 2 interactions in the Cluster Composition Analysis module.   (E)   Output .xls file for a \u201cMantel-Haenszel test\u201d for 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 interaction of the Factors F1, F2, and F3.   (F)   Bar plot generated by the \u201cMantel-Haenszel test\u201d for 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 interactions in the Cluster Composition Analysis module. \n  \n\n### Multinomial Test \n  \nThe software performs a multinomial test within each cluster and saves the output in a dedicated XLS file: \u201cinput file name\u201d-multinomial\u2014\u201ctested factor\u201d.xls ( ). The result is a matrix with as many rows as the number of clusters. For each cluster, the software gives back the cluster ID, the factor of interest, the distribution of the observed frequencies (i.e., the number of peaks within level 1, level 2, and so on), the cardinality, the   p  -value. In the last   n   columns (depending on the number of levels of the factor), the prior likelihood (PL) of each level is reported, as well as the observed probability for each cluster (i.e., the proportion of foci for each level with respect to the cardinality of the cluster). This information is needed to infer which of the   n   levels significantly exceeds the PL. On the top row, the selected H0 and the selected type of multinomial test are reported. This would be the test of choice when one wants to test the association of a cluster with one level of a multi-level factor, for example, the comparison of three tasks within the same group, or the comparison of three groups. \n\n\n### Fisher's Exact Test \n  \nIn this case two binary factors X and Y are considered. The four possible combinations of the levels of the factors can be represented as the cells of a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table. Also, different types of null hypothesis are considered: (1) the hypothesis of independence is   H  :  OR   = 1;(2) the Prior Likelihood hypothesis is   H  :  OR   =   OR   (i.e., the OR computed in the whole dataset before clustering the data). The alternative hypothesis is   H  :  OR   \u2260   OR  . The program computes a test in each cluster and saves the output in a XLS file: \u201cinput file name\u201d-fisher\u2014\u201ctested factors\u201d.xls ( ). The result is a matrix with as many rows as the number of clusters. For each cluster, the software returns the cluster ID, the observed odds ratio and the   p  -value. The selected null hypothesis is also printed. Finally, a bar-plot representing the observed distribution of each cluster is printed in a dedicated folder \u201cFisher_figures\u201d (an example is reported in  ). This would be the test of choice, for example, when one wants to test the hypothesis that two groups of subjects differ in a given cluster specifically for one of two tasks (Paulesu et al.,  ; Devoto et al.,  ). \n\n\n### The Mantel-Haenszel Test (MH) \n  \nThis can be considered as an extension of the Fisher's exact test. It can be applied to explore 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 interactions by identifying the factor that, according to the specific users' hypotheses, can be considered the moderator. Similarly to the previous tests, the program computes a MH test for each cluster and saves the output in a dedicated XLS file: \u201cinput file name\u201d\u2014Mantel_Haenszel.xls ( ). Finally, a bar-plot representing the observed distribution of each cluster is printed in a dedicated folder \u201cFigure-Mantel_Haenszel-tested factors\u201d (an example is reported in  ). The joint bar-plot is split according with the factor chosen to stratify the analysis. \n\nThis test would allow one, for example, to the hypothesis that two groups (e.g., lean or overweight subjects) differ for one of two stimuli (e.g., high calorie food) providing that this is delivered during one of two physiological states (e.g., when fasting). \n\n\n\n## Section 2: Validation Study\u2014A Formal Comparison Between Club and Ginger ALE Based on Performance Measures \n  \nThis validation focussed on the Cluster Analysis module and implied the following steps: \n  \nThe analysis of the fMRI data of 24 subjects during a reading experiment (block-design) and the identification of a reference reading map with a standard second\u2013level random effect analysis; \n  \nThe extraction of individual activation peaks for the reading task from individual fixed-effects analysis; \n  \nThe meta-analysis of the individual data collected at step 2 with both CluB and GingerALE; \n  \nThe comparison of the meta-analyses with the reference reading map and estimates of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for both the CluB and GingerALE analyses. \n  \nHere is worth noting that by means of this approach we treated each single subject as a single experiment in which within-study variability can be assumed to be roughly constant (as a result of the experimental task constraints), while taking mostly into account between-studies variability. \n\nThe methods of fMRI scanning are fully described in Danelli et al. ( ). The fMRI task involved 120 fMRI entire brain volumes collected in alternating blocks of 10 scans of the baseline condition and 10 scans of the experimental task (TR = 3\u2033); thus, we had six blocks of baseline and six blocks of experimental stimuli. The participants were asked to silently read words and pseudowords. A total of 45 words and 45 pseudowords were presented in the six experimental blocks (15 for each block). \n\nFor all participants, the sampled anatomical space included the entire cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. For each participant, a standard pre-processing and a Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) convolution were applied using SPM12; once obtained the smoothed-normalized-realigned-coregistered images, the two experimental conditions (baseline and reading conditions) were modeled in a first level-analysis conforming to a standard block-design. This allowed us to estimate, according to the general linear model implemented in SPM12, the subject-specific effect of interest: the contrast image (con-image) \u201c  reading   >   baseline  \u201d extracted at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. The significant activation peaks were saved in an excel file to create a database for the meta-analytic procedures. As a consequence, each single subject was considered as an independent study. In particular, a total of 579 activation peaks were extracted from the 24 subject-specific   reading   >   baseline   comparison. Thus, for the 24 participants we extracted a mean of 24.2 activation peaks (min = 3; MAX = 77). The raw dataset was then passed to the GingerALE 2.3.6 software in order to exclude, from the pool of 579 activation peaks, coordinates laying outside the less conservative brain mask available within the software (this was done in order to maintain only the stereotactic coordinates located in gray matter). After this anatomical filtering process, we remained with 520 activation peaks (the 10.19% of the original dataset was eliminated). The 520 activation peaks constituted the pool of data that we used to run the two meta-analyses: one with the GingerALE method and the other with the CluB method. \n\nThe analysis with Ginger-ALE was run by setting the following parameters: (1) brain mask: less conservative; (2) uncorrected threshold   p   < 0.001; (3) no minimum cluster volume. \n\nThe GingerALE method identified 10 clusters (average extended volume 8,154 mm ), the detailed description of the brain regions underlying reading, according to GingerALE, is reported in   and in  . \n  \nResults of the ALE analysis with a cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.001, uncorrected. \n  \n For each cluster, the volume, the coordinates in MNI stereotaxic space of the local maxima and the maximum ALEscore observed are reported  . \n    \nComparison of GingerALE and CluB solutions with reference to a data set of 24 subjects involved in a reading task. Axial view (top) and 3D rendering (bottom) of the results generated by   (A)   the second-level SPM random-effects analysis (i.e., the \u201cGold Standard\u201d);   (B)   the optimized hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in CluB;   (C)   the GingerALE software. \n  \nFor the meta-analysis run with CluB the following parameters were set: (1) Users' spatial criterion: mean standard deviation along the three axes <6 mm. This was done in order to conform the spatial resolution of the CluB method to the spatial resolution applied in GingerALE 2.3.6 (the standard deviation of the Gaussian Probability Distribution used to compute the ALE maps is set to 6 mm). \n\nThe algorithm identified a total of 75 clusters scattered all over the brain, with 3\u201315 individual activation peaks each (median value = 6). The mean standard deviations along the three axes was 5.60 mm (x axis), 5.94 mm (y axis) and 5.78 mm (z axis). A complete list of these clusters is provided in   and the spatial distribution of the clusters (according to the cardinality and the density measures) is represented in  . \n  \nResults of CluB with user's spatial criterion set to 6 mm. \n  \n For each cluster, the mean centroid coordinates in MNI stereotaxic space, the standard deviation along the three axes and the cardinality (N) are reported  . \n  \nFinally, the 24 con-images representing the single-subject voxel-by-voxel difference between reading and baseline were entered in a random effect second level analysis to obtain our gold-standard reference activation map. The General Linear Model (GLM) was designed to model a one-sample   t  -test and to extract the mean neural network associated with single word silent reading (once the effect of the early visual processes was eliminated). The results were extracted at   p   < 0.001, no spatial extent threshold has been adopted here. The results are reported in   and in  , and are in line with the large amount of literature available on this topic (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). \n  \nResults of the random-effects second-level SPM analysis with a significance threshold set to   p   < 0.001, uncorrected. \n  \n For each local maxima the coordinates in MNI stereotaxic space, the cluster extent (k, number of voxels) and the Z-score are reported  . \n  \nAs described at point 4, we compared the results of the two meta-analytic procedures with the results of the standard random effect analysis according to the following steps: \n  \nWe extracted the t-map corresponding to the reference reading map (our gold-standard) from the SPM12 analyses, \n  \nWe converted the results of our meta-analyses from .nii to .voi, \n  \nThe .nii and the .voi files were overlapped to the \u201cch2bet\u201d template available in MRIcron (Rorden and Brett,  ) to identify, for each single meta-analytic map the brain regions shared with the reference-reading map, \n  \nWe saved the shared regions in dedicated .voi files called GingerALE-intersection and CluB-intersection, respectively. \n  \nThe intersections were overlaid to the \u201cch2bet\u201d template and explored using the \u201cdescriptive\u201d function available in MRIcron. As a result we obtained the anatomical distribution of the overlays and the associated voxel-count and volumetry. This result represents, for each single meta-analytic procedure, the so called true positives (TP), i.e., the voxels that are actually activated by our subjects, and that resulted to be active according to the specific pooling method of each meta-analytic algorithm ( ). \n  \nPictorial representation of the procedure implied in the calculation of the performance measures. Graphical representation of the comparison between the results of the \u201cGold Standard\u201d (green) and the meta-analytic map (CluB, in blue). Inactive voxels (i.e., voxels not displaying a significant effect in the second-level SPM fMRI results\u2014the \u201cGold Standard\u201d) are represented in cyan. The output of the comparison (i.e., intersection or subtraction) between the maps is represented in purple. The same procedure was applied to compare the meta-analytic map generated by the GingerALE software with the \u201cGold Standard\u201d. \n  \nTo identify the true negatives (TN), i.e., the brain regions that were not active in our sample and that did not result activated in the meta-analytic procedures, we selected the mask file of the SPM 12 one sample   t  -test (i.e., the neurofunctional space mapped by our experiment) and we subtracted the reference reading map to obtain the so-called \u201cinactive map.\u201d Secondly, we overlapped the inactive map with each single meta-analytic map and we applied the masking procedure (i.e., a subtraction) to obtain the distribution of the TN voxels ( ). \n\nThe false positives (FP, i.e., the voxels that resulted to be activated in the meta-analytic map, but that were not active in our gold-standard result) were identified by overlapping the inactive map with the results of each single meta-analysis ( ). Finally, the false negatives (FN, i.e., the voxels that were significantly activated in the gold-standard map, but not detected by the meta-analysis) were obtained by subtracting the results of the meta-analysis from the reference reading map ( ). As a result, we obtained the 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables reported in  ,  , respectively. These were used to compute performance measures for the two meta-analytic procedures: sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. \n  \nContingency table of the second-level SPM results (i.e., the Gold-Standard) and the GingerALE map. \n    \nContingency table of the second-level SPM results (i.e., the Gold-Standard) and the CluB map. \n  \nIn particular, sensitivity expresses the proportion of actual positives findings that are correctly identified. Thus, it represents the true positive rate [TP\/(TP + FN)]. Specificity corresponds to the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified. Thus, specificity expresses the proportion of \u201c  real  \u201d negative findings [TN\/(TN + FP)]. Finally, accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correct assessments (both positive and negative) over the entire sample [(TN + TP)\/(TN + TP + FN + FP)]. \n\nThe performance measures described above, and the corresponding confidence intervals (95%) were computed using the \u201cepi.tests\u201d function available in the \u201cepiR\u201d library of R (version 0.9-48, Stevenson et al.,  ). \n\nThe GingerALE method obtained the following performance scores: (1) Sensitivity = 0.728 [0.722\u20130.734]; (2) Specificity = 0.971 [0.97\u20130.971]; (3) Accuracy = 0.967 [0.966\u20130.967]. The CluB method obtained (1) Sensitivity = 0.139 [0.134\u20130.143], (2) Specificity = 0.969 [0.969\u20130.97], (3) Accuracy = 0.956 [0.955\u20130.956]. \n\nTo conclude this empirical assessment, the concordance between the two meta-analytic methods was evaluated. The two meta-analytic methods were treated as \u201ctwo independent classifiers.\u201d Thus, in order to obtain a global measure of concordance between the two meta-analytic methods, a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table was created and, as a consequence, four classes of events were considered: \n  \nActive voxels both in the GingerALE and in the CluB maps, that were calculated as an intersection between the two neurofunctional maps ( ); \n  \nActive voxels in the CluB map only, i.e., the result of the subtraction between the CluB map and the GingerALE map ( ); \n  \nActive voxels in the GingerALE map only, i.e., the result of the subtraction between the GingerALE map and the CluB map ( ); \n  \nInactive voxels both in the GingerALE and in the CluB maps, that were calculated as a difference between the total number of voxels investigated and the number of voxels classified according to the previous classes of events ( ). \n    \nContingency table of the GingerALE and the CluB maps. \n  \nThis classification was performed by computing nine clustering maps varying the user's spatial criterion from 6 to 14 mm (with steps of 1 mm) . In order to overcome some of the methodological limitations encountered with the classical Cohen's Kappa measure (it has been demonstrated that the Cohen's kappa is sensitive to trait prevalence and marginal probabilities), the AC  measure proposed by Gwet ( ) was adopted here. With respect to table, the AC  is calculated as follows: \n\nWhere   P   represents the observed concordance [see Equation (7)],   P  (\u03b3), represents the modified chance correction [see Equation (8)]; while   A   and B   represent the marginal frequency of the contingency table represented in  . \n\nAccordingly, the between methods concordance when the user's spatial criterion was set to 6 mm is AC  = 0.933. The neuroanatomical distribution of the overlap between the GingerALE and the CluB maps is reported in  ; among the 75 clusters identified by the CluB method, 47 (i.e., the 62.67%) fell outside the GingerALE map. The details about the concordance measures computed for the remaining clustering solutions are reported in  . \n  \nComparison between CluB and GingerALE. Axial view of the neuroanatomical distribution of the overlap between the CluB map (in blue) and the GingerALE map (in red). These overlaps were used to compute the concordance measures between the two meta-analytic methods, as described in the main text. \n    \nConcordance measures between the GingerALE map and the results of CluB with the User's Spatial Criterion set from 7 to 14 mm. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the past decade an increasing, perhaps overwhelming, number of neuroimaging papers has been published on peer-review journals. This large amount of data represents a rich source of empirical evidence that can be used to test specific cognitive models, to explore disease-related neurofunctional and neuromorphometrical changes and to map, for example, developmental trajectories in brain functions and structures. To make the most from this source of data, a reasonable solution is to pool them by means of meta-analytic procedures. Moreover, by means of meta-analysis we can overcome, or at least minimize, the well-known methodological limitations of neuroimaging studies, such as: (1) the specific influence of the selected experimental paradigm that makes the results of a single study not necessarily bound to gain a general validity (with the well-known problem associated with the subtraction logic; Logothetis,  ); (2) the problem of multiple comparisons and of the balance between false positive and false negative rates (Lieberman and Cunningham,  ); (3) the typical small sample sizes of neuroimaging studies (Murphy and Garavan,  ). \n\nTo circumvent these problems, two different classes of strategies are available: (i) to create open shared databases of raw neuroimaging data (something that is currently in the neuroimaging research agenda); (ii) to pool together the positive findings reported in peer-review scientific literature. This last option is better known as coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA). \n\nAlthough CBMAs are now fully accepted in the international literature, some methodological consideration needs to be made. As we anticipated in the introduction, the first limitation is that CBMAs are not able to reproduce exactly the results of pooled image based meta-analyses (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). \n\nThis information loss is inevitably due to the relative spatial sparseness of the stereotactic coordinates reported in the different scientific reports. Moreover, one has to consider that there is not a standard rule to report regional effects and their peaks in an imaging paper. Different laboratories adopt different strategies to report their results; some researchers can report just the local maxima for each cluster of activation, while other may decide to report more than one stereotactic coordinate for each cluster. Finally, the stereotactic coordinates that emerge from a study depend from a series of methodological choices made by the researcher and in particular, by the choice of the statistical threshold as well as by the dimension of the kernel Gaussian filter adopted during the smoothing phase. Salimi-Khorshidi et al. ( ) suggest that the adoption of a voxel-wise comparison with an   uncorrected p-value   threshold is the better methodological choice to pool together stereotactic coordinates and to obtain a meta-analytic map similar to the one that we would have obtained by directly pooling together several fMRI (or MRI) data-sets. \n\n### CluB vs. GingerALE: Two Sides of the Same Coin \n  \nThe selection of an instrument\/test, as well as the development of a new tool, requires the assessment of its performance and of its accuracy. Here we adopted the measures typically used in clinical studies to assess the performance of our new toolbox, with respect to the most popular toolbox for meta-analysis of neuroimaging data: GingerALE. \n\nFrom the results of our analyses a clear difference between the two methodologies emerged. The GingerALE method obtained a high level of accuracy (0.967) associated with a high sensitivity (0.728) and specificity (0.971). The CluB method obtained a similar level of accuracy (0.956), even though in the presence of imbalanced data this overall measure has to be taken \u201c  cum grano salis\u201d  ; this was associated with similar level of specificity (0.969), notwithstanding the low-level of sensitivity (0.14). \n\nThis first result suggests that, while the two meta-analytic methods are equally accurate in identifying the true negatives, the CluB method is not as sensitive as the GingerALE method in identifying the true positive. Among the 22,223 active voxels in the   expected results   map, CluB correctly identified only 3,083 voxels (i.e., the 13.8%). However, with this regard a technical consideration needs to be made. The GingerALE method is based on the application of a three-dimensional Gaussian filter to each single activation peak collected in the input data-set. The final result is a continuously distributed anatomo-functional map (similar to the one that we would obtain with standard analyses; see the \u201cgold-standard\u201d map for an example). On the contrary, the CluB method creates a discrete and spatially sparse map of clusters, as one of the intrinsic aim of the hierarchical clustering procedure is to obtain a map of distinct entities whose spatial extension is limited by the choice of the \u201c  user's spatial criterion  .\u201d This is to say that with the GingerALE methods we are modeling the input data to simulate a standard activation map, while with the CluB method we are working on raw data (the stereotactic coordinates reported in the peer-reviewed selected literature) and we are focusing our attention to small and   ad-hoc   separated portion of the brain. \n\nIn other words, while the final result of GingerALE is more similar to an activation map devoided of information on local maxima, the final result of CluB is more similar to the summary table typically produced by a software like SPM. \n\nWhile this may seem a drawback of the CluB method, from the neuroanatomical point of view, it represents one of its strengths. Indeed, the relative finer-grained and not smoothed spatial resolution of the clustering maps, together with the maintenance of the original distribution of the data, permits to explore neurofunctional segregation with a robust statistical approach (the one described in the CCA) based on non-parametric, exact tests. This is something that can be hardly done with GingerALE, which, at the most, can identify the commonalities and the differences between two sets of data (see, for example, Fornara et al.,  ), but no higher order effects like 2 \u00d7 2 interactions in a data-driven manner, starting from meta-analyses containing more than two classes of data (Paulesu et al.,  ; Devoto et al.,  ) . Such higher order effects are frequently what matters the most in neuroscientific investigations. \n\nOne final consideration needs to be made on the spatial distribution of the GingerALE map: the smoothing applied to the input data tends, somehow, to inflate the spatial distribution of the native data beyond the expected anatomical boundaries (see   for an illustration). On the contrary CluB allows one to test specific anatomically constrained hypotheses by imposing anatomical masks on the analyses allowing one to keep separated the inference on regions that are spatially close but functionally distant or hardly equivalent; for example, the cerebellum and the occipital lobe; the thalamus and the basal ganglia. This possibility is offered by the   peak segregation module   of CluB. \n  \nRegion of interest oriented comparison of CLuB and GingerALE. The region of interest (in green, the \u201cGold Standard\u201d) was taken from the SPM data analysis on 24 readers. The peaks composing the left inferior occipital cluster (  X   = \u221230,   Y   = \u221293,   Z   = \u221211) in the HC map (user's spatial criterion = 6 mm) are shown as 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm white cubic voxels. The cluster obtained in the HC map (user's spatial criterion = 6 mm) is depicted in blue. The ALE map obtained by GingerALE is depicted in red. It can be seen that while the clustering solution (in blue) is contained within the SPM \u201cGold Standard\u201d map, GingerALE somewhat overestimated the activation effect as a consequence of the Gaussianization of the raw data implied. From slice in top left:   Z   = \u221220 to   Z   = +3 in the right bottom corner. \n  \nAs a last step of our comparative assessment, we evaluated the between-methods concordance. In particular, to overcome the problem associated with the unknown prevalence of the phenomenon investigated, we adopted the AC  measure proposed by Gwet ( ). Using this measure, we found that the two meta-analytic methods have a high level of agreement (93.3%). This result is confirmed by the neuroanatomical distribution of the neuroimaging findings (see   for more details). \n\nTo conclude, we wish to emphasize that the seemingly contrasting meta-analytic approaches compared here are in fact complementary in nature: one is based on the idea that each focus of activation is better represented by a probability distribution rather than in terms of a single data-point (i.e., the GingerALE method); CluB takes a different stance, as each activation peak is considered as a single data-point and it is not weighted or modeled any further. In other words, these two methods could be thought as two sides of the same coin, with the GingerALE method being optimal for neurofunctional mapping of pooled data, and the CluB method being the optimal choice if one wants to test more specific neurocognitive hypotheses. However, notwithstanding these two different basic ideas, from the neurofunctional point of view they reach a good level of concordance. \n\nFinally, for those interested in a hierarchical clustering meta-analysis, the congruence between the HC solutions and those of an ALE map, corrected for multiple comparison, may permit to decide on which set of clusters to proceed with further assessments of the data using a CCA (see, for example, Paulesu et al.,  ) with the trust that the cluster considered is \u201cspatially significant\u201d. \n\n\n### Future Directions \n  \nWhile creating a new toolbox, many issues may rise, and many others can emerge when reviewing the existing instruments. Among these, the first issue that we want to report as a stimulus for further development is the fact that the meta-analytic approaches considered in this paper just rely on the reported activation peaks in the peer-review literature and just consider the spatial distribution of these peaks without taking into account the magnitude of the effect of interest. Usually, the magnitude of the effect is expressed as either a   t-value   or as a   Z-score  . Thus, it may be desirable to develop new algorithms capable of taking into account also one of these measures (arguably the Z-scores as they do not depend on the degrees of freedom of the test) to obtain a better fitting of the data to the expected results. Moreover, by introducing the   t-value   or the   Z-score   associated with each activation peak, the lack of between-studies uniformity in reporting the coordinates may be reduced, as usually the papers that report the higher number of activation peaks are also those that adopted a less conservative statistic threshold (David et al.,  ). This problem has been recently addressed in the GingerALE algorithm by introducing also the study as one of the level in the analysis and hence taking into account also within-study variability. By doing this, the probability that one study with many foci drives a meta-analytic result has been mitigated (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). A similar approach has been now incorporated in the Multikernel Density Approach (MKDA). \n\nOn the contrary, at the moment this issue remains unaddressed by the CluB method. One can only recommend, as a form of best practice, to reduce the amount of data per study, when these are exceedingly redundant, by taking only the local maximum for each region of by calculating a preliminary high-resolution CluB clustering solution on the redundant study. Admittedly, this approach requires some a-priori decision on what would be a redundant style of data description. \n\nAnother important issue is the one related with the problem of inactive areas. As imaging papers only report positive findings in the form of stereotactic coordinates, the inactive voxels are just represented, both in GingerALE and CluB, by zeros. As a consequence, measurements of non-active areas are lost and this, in turn, makes impossible to evaluate whether the outcome in that particular brain region would have become significant by pooling data from different studies. This means that CBMAs methods, in general, cannot aggregate power across studies, unless the effect of every single voxel is taken into account (Costafreda,  ). \n\nThe last methodological consideration is about the adoption of hierarchical clustering and of the Ward's method. This clustering procedure maximizes the between-cluster difference and minimizes the within cluster variability; this procedure, in turn, creates localized blobs, such as those represented in  . The result is the emergence of localized sets of activations that, however, do not seem to fully represent the complexity of brain functioning and connection. It may be the case that the adoption of a different clustering procedure, capable of representing distributed clusters rather than localized blobs, may turn into a more adequate model of the neurofunctional effect of interest. A possible candidate for this problem may be the adoption of minimum spanning tree (Jain et al.,  ), a clustering method that is typically used, and had been fully developed, to design networks, such as computer or electrical networks (Graham and Hell,  ). Recently, this clustering method has been adopted to identify the neural network underlying specific cognitive function in the context of functional connectivity studies (Baumgartner et al.,  ; Firat et al.,  ). The authors started from the simple assumption that brain regions that show the same type of activation may constitute spatially sparse brain networks (Carpenter and Just,  ). Therefore, in this case the similarity measure would not be based on spatial proximity, but rather on temporal co-occurrence of brain activity. Further studies are needed to better address this issue and to develop this possibility. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript\/ . \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nComitato Etico Scientifico dell'A.O.

Familiarity and repetition may increase the liking of a piece of music, thus inducing positive emotions. Neuroimaging studies have focused on identifying the brain regions involved in the processing of familiar and unfamiliar musical stimuli. However, the use of different modalities and experimental designs has led to discrepant results and it is not clear which areas of the brain are most reliably engaged when listening to familiar and unfamiliar musical excerpts. In the present study, we conducted a systematic review from three databases (Medline, PsychoINFO, and Embase) using the keywords (recognition OR familiar OR familiarity OR exposure effect OR repetition) AND (music OR song) AND (brain OR brains OR neuroimaging OR functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging OR Position Emission Tomography OR Electroencephalography OR Event Related Potential OR Magnetoencephalography). Of the 704 titles identified, 23 neuroimaging studies met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. After removing studies providing insufficient information or contrasts, 11 studies (involving 212 participants) qualified for the meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Our results did not find significant peak activations consistently across included studies. Using a less conservative approach (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons) we found that the left superior frontal gyrus, the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus of the left thalamus, and the left medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus had the highest likelihood of being activated by familiar music. On the other hand, the left insula, and the right anterior cingulate cortex had the highest likelihood of being activated by unfamiliar music. We had expected limbic structures as top clusters when listening to familiar music. But, instead, music familiarity had a motor pattern of activation. This could reflect an audio-motor synchronization to the rhythm which is more engaging for familiar tunes, and\/or a sing-along response in one's mind, anticipating melodic, harmonic progressions, rhythms, timbres, and lyric events in the familiar songs. These data provide evidence for the need for larger neuroimaging studies to understand the neural correlates of music familiarity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMusic is ubiquitous in human culture and has been present since prehistorical times (Conard et al.,  ). Music does not appear to have a survival value, yet most of the current literature has pinpointed it as a fundamental aspect of human life, describing it as a \u201cuniversal reward\u201d (Trehub et al.,  ). People often value music for the emotions it generates (Juslin and Laukka,  ; Brattico and Pearce,  ), and listening to music can help to regulate mood and increase well-being (Hills and Argyle,  ; Kawakami et al.,  ). This might explain the use of music in people's everyday lives (Sch\u00e4fer and Sedlmeier,  ). \n\nFamiliarity or repeated exposure in music has been reported as an important factor modulating emotional and hedonic responses in the brain (Pereira et al.,  ). The familiarity principle, also known as the \u201cmere exposure effect,\u201d was first described by Zajonc ( ). It is a psychological phenomenon which suggests that the more exposed we are to someone or something, the more we like it. Repetition in music can be of different types: within a piece, across pieces, or across multiple hearings (Margulis,  ). Both familiarity and repetition may increase the liking of a piece of music, thus inducing positive emotions (Witviliet and Vrana,  ; Omar Ali and Peynircioglu,  ). \n\nLong before its description in 1968, the phenomenon of familiarity had been known by social psychologists and applied to the music field (King and Prior,  ). The first person who documented it was Meyer in 1903. He presented his subjects with a dozen repetitions of unfamiliar music that he had composed. After listening to the last repetition, most subjects asserted that \u201cthe aesthetic effect was improved by hearing the music repeatedly\u201d (Meyer,  ). Moreover, Meyer showed that melodies which ended on the frequency ratio symbol 2 (the Lipps-Meyer Law) was preferred to all other melodies. However, this law was later on disputed by Paul Farnsworth, his student, who argued that interval ending preferences could be altered by training. Therefore, repetition and familiarity with a specific ratio ending could increase preference for that specific ending. This effect, explaining the perception of music closure, was called the \u201chabit principle\u201d (Farnsworth,  ). Overall, it seems familiarity deepens the understanding of music and engagement with music listening (King and Prior,  ). \n\nHowever, according to numerous studies, the relationship between exposure and enjoyment is non-linear, following an inverted-U shape preference response. Repeated exposure to music can increase pleasure (\u201chedonic value\u201d) for a certain period, but ultimately gives rise to increasing displeasure (Jakobovits,  ; Berlyne,  ; Szpunar et al.,  ; Schellenberg,  ). \n\nThere are different explanations for the inverted U-shape preference response. One is the perceptual fluency model (Bornstein and D'Agostino,  ) which explains that people incorrectly assume that the facilitated processing of a familiar stimulus is associated to some positive attribute of the stimulus itself. However, as the conscious recognition of fluency processing increases, they stop misattributing this effect to the stimulus but to repeated exposure, and therefore pleasure decreases. Another explanation proposed by Berlyne ( ) states that the inverted U reflects the \u201cinteraction of two opposing impulses:\u201d the ascending part arises from an evolutionary conditioned preference for the familiar (positive learned safety effect), and the subsequent decline of the U favors for novelty seeking (aversion to boredom). Moreover, the complexity of the stimulus also influences the timescale of satiation effect. According to Szpunar et al. ( ), despite initial increases in liking, after the stimulus complexity has been absorbed, boredom intercedes, and satiation reduces likability. \n\nPeretz et al. reported that familiarity is best conceptualized as an \u201cimplicit memory phenomenon,\u201d in which previous experience aids the performance of a task without conscious awareness of these previous episodes (Peretz et al.,  ). The ability to recognize familiar melodies appeared to be dependent on the integrity of pitch and rhythm perception. Of these two factors, pitch is thought to play a more important role (H\u00e9bert and Peretz,  ). The authors noted that \u201calthough the mere exposure effect is simple to define and to reproduce experimentally, it is more complicated to explain.\u201d \n\nFamiliarity is a complex subject and the neural mechanisms underlying this memory phenomenon toward music listening are still not very clear or consistent. Some authors define familiarity as a semantic memory process, which is a declarative knowledge (e.g., words, colors, faces, or music) acquired over a lifetime. Musical semantic memory is defined as the long-term storage of songs or musical excerpts, which enables us to have a strong feeling of familiarity when we listen to music (Groussard et al.,  ). Brain lesion studies showed that music semantic memory appears to involve both hemispheres; however, the integrity of the left hemisphere is critical, suggesting functional asymmetry favoring the left hemisphere for semantic memory (Platel et al.,  ). Neuroimaging studies featuring musical semantic memory have reported the involvement of the anterior part of the temporal lobes, either in the left hemisphere or bilaterally, and the activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area (BA) 47) (Plailly et al.,  ). Groussard and her co-workers also found activation of the superior temporal gyri (BA 22). The right superior temporal gyrus is mostly involved in the retrieval of perceptual memory traces (information about rhythm and pitch), which are useful for deciding whether or not a melody is familiar. The left superior temporal gyrus seems to be involved in distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar melodies (Groussard et al.,  ). \n\nPlailly et al. ( ) also addressed the neural correlates of familiarity and its multimodal nature by studying odors and musical excerpts stimuli. These were used to investigate the feeling of familiarity and unfamiliarity. Results for the feeling of familiarity indicated a bimodal activation pattern in the left hemisphere, specifically the superior and inferior frontal gyri, the precuneus, the angular gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the hippocampus. On the other hand, the feeling of unfamiliarity (impression of novelty) of odors and music was related to the activation of the right anterior insula (Plailly et al.,  ). Janata ( ) studied the neural correlates of music-evoked autobiographical memories in healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer disease. His findings showed that familiar songs from our own past can trigger emotionally salient episodic memories and that this process is mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). In the same study, hearing familiar songs also activated the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA), left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral thalamus, and the right cerebellar hemisphere (Janata,  ). \n\nBrain imaging studies in the neurobiology of reward during music listening demonstrated the involvement of mesolimbic striatal areas, especially the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the ventral striatum. This structure is connected with subcortical limbic areas such as the amygdala and hippocampus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and also integrated with cortical areas including the orbital cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These limbic and paralimbic structures are considered the core structures of emotional and reward processing (Koelsch,  ; Salimpoor et al.,  ; Zatorre and Salimpoor,  ). Recently, Pereira et al. ( ) investigated familiarity and music preference effects in determining the emotional involvement of the listeners and showed that familiarity with the music contributed more to the recruitment of the limbic and reward centers of the brain. \n\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is another neuroimaging technique that enabled us to address the brain's response to stimuli. It provides a real-time picture of neural activity, recording how it varies millisecond by millisecond. Time-locked EEG activity or event-related potential (ERP) are small voltages generated in the brain structures in response to specific sensory, cognitive or motor event (Luck,  ). With regards to auditory stimuli\u2014and, more specifically, to music listening and recognition\u2014the N1, P200, P300, and N400 waves have been found to be particularly important. N1, a negative component found 80\u2013110 ms after stimulus onset, is thought to represent the detection of a sound and its features, as well as detection of change of any kind (pitch, loudness, source location etc.) (N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen and Picton,  ; Sepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ). It originates in the temporal lobe, predominantly in or near the primary auditory cortex, suggesting that it is involved in early phases of information processing (Hyde,  ). Secondly, P2 is a positive component that arises 160\u2013200 ms after the onset of the stimulus (Sepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ) and is localized in the parieto-occipital region (Rozynski and Chen,  ). It is involved in evaluation and classification of the stimulus (Sepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ) as well as other related cognitive processes, such as working memory and semantic processing (Freunberger et al.,  ). P3, instead, is considered to be more related to selective attention and information processing, such as recognition and memory processes. It is traditionally divided into P3a, arising in the frontal region, and P3b, arising in the temporal and parietal regions; it appears 300\u2013400 ms after the stimulus and lasts 300\u2013600 ms (Patel and Azzam,  ). However, its timing can vary widely, so it is often described as the late positive complex (LPC), a definition which also includes later deflections, such as P500 and P600 (Finnigan et al.,  ). Finally, N400 arises 200\u2013600 ms after the stimulus, but its anatomical localization has not been well defined since it does not seem to be related to a specific mental operation only. Indeed, it seems to be connected to the processing of meaning at all levels, since it is influenced by factors acting both at lower and at higher levels of these cognitive processes (Kutas and Federmeier,  ). \n\nAdvances in brain imaging techniques have facilitated the examination of music familiarity processing in the human brain. Nevertheless, the use of different modalities and experimental designs has led to differing results. Over the years, studies have used varying music stimuli such as melodies, songs with and without lyrics, with diverse acoustic complexity. Due to this heterogeneity, it is not clear which areas are most reliably engaged when listening to familiar and unfamiliar songs and melodies. \n\nTo our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducted to resolve the inconsistencies in the literature. The present study systematically reviews the existing literature to establish the neural correlates of music familiarity, in healthy population using different neuroimaging methods, including fMRI, PET, EEG, ERP, and MEG. Finally, we used the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (Eickhoff et al.,  ) to conduct a series of coordinate-based meta-analyses for fMRI and PET studies. We expected to find brain areas related to emotion or reward as the most active regions when listening to familiar music, as familiarity is positively correlated with likeability and pleasure, at least to a certain number of exposures. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Literature selection \n  \nSearch Strategy: The search strategy was developed through consultation with the co-authors and a research librarian. The keywords used were (recognition OR familiar OR familiarity OR exposure effect OR repetition) AND (music OR song) AND (brain OR brains OR neuroimaging OR functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging OR Position Emission Tomography OR Electroencephalography OR Event Related Potential OR Magnetoencephalography). The following international electronic databases were searched on July 19th, 2016 and revised on July 11th, 2018: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase. The search was run simultaneously on these databases, using Ovid. For each study included in this review, manual searches of reference lists were conducted for additional articles. Research Ethics Board approval was not required as analysis in this study did not involve data collection. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \nArticles selected for inclusion in the systematic review satisfied the following criteria: (a) published between 1996 and 2016; (b) published in English; (c) published in peer-reviewed journals; (d) study results reporting brain regions or coordinates; (e) familiar or unfamiliar music or tone listening as the primary stimulus, regardless of the genre of music and music instrument; (f) sample size to be equal or more than 10 subjects; (g) only experiments with non-clinical adult participants to eliminate potential differences in brain activation that may be associated with neurological or psychiatric illness. \n\nFor the meta-analysis the final inclusion criteria were (h) the activation foci where the contrast compared familiar music to unfamiliar music or vice versa; (i) the studies reported whole brain activity, rather than region-of-interest analysis, with complete coordinates of activation in standardized stereotaxic space (i.e., Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] or Talairach) (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). \n\nTwo reviewers (CF and EM) independently screened titles, abstracts and full text for relevance. Studies were included if they met the inclusion criteria. We followed the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Statement (Liberati et al.,  ; Moher et al.,  ). The flowchart of article selection is shown in Figure  . \n  \nFlowchart of article selection, following PRISMA guidelines. Adapted from Moher et al. ( ). \n  \n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nThe meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach (Turkeltaub et al.,  ,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ) found in the GingerALE 2.3 software ( ) (Lancaster et al.,  ). As most peak activations (70.0% of all foci) were specified in MNI space, we converted the remaining number of peak activations specified in Talairach space to MNI space using the Brain Map software ( ), which implements the Lancaster transformation prior to analysis (Laird et al.,  ). We followed the methodological guidelines described in the user manual for GingerALE 2.3. \n\nWe performed independent data-set analyses (one for each contrast), which was used to identify areas of consistent activation across all studies. In the ALE analysis, we first modeled an activation map (MA) for each experiment. These maps were created using the mask, the foci and three-dimensional Gaussian probabilities defined by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values, derived from the subject size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Subsequently, the union or summation of all MA maps from all experiments produced an ALE map that described the convergence of results at each voxel of the brain, estimating the likelihood of activation at each voxel. Then, the ALE map was compared with an empirically defined null distribution map resulting from a permutation procedure to assess statistical significance (Laird et al.,  ). Lastly, for each meta-analysis, the family-wise error (FWE) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons at a significant cluster level of threshold of   p   < 0.05 (cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level   p   < 0.05, 5000 permutations). However, no peaks survived the correction for multiple comparisons. We also performed an FDR correction which did not reach statistical significance as well. For this reason, we used   p   < 0.001 uncorrected for the threshold, with no minimum cluster size. The use of uncorrected   p  -value threshold is also a valid method described in the user manual for GingerALE 2.3, along with a recommendation to choose a very conservative threshold, such as   p   < 0.001 or   p   < 0.0001. No foci were located outside the GingerALE 2.3 gray matter mask, so there were no foci excluded from analysis. \n\nTo visualize the meta-analysis results, ALE output images were overlaid onto an anatomical T1-weighted image, the Colin brain template in MNI space (Holmes et al.,  ). Mango software package version 3.2.3 ( ) was used to create the region-of-interest (ROIs) identified from the ALE analyses. The final ALE scores indicated that the likelihood that any single peak of the total peaks occurred in a single voxel located in the template MRI. These ALE values ranged from 0.007 to a theoretical maximum of 1.0. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Results of the literature search \n  \n#### Inclusion in the systematic review \n  \nOf the 704 titles identified, 23 neuroimaging studies met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. These consisted of fifteen functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), three positron emission tomography (PET), and five event-related potential (ERP) studies (Table  ). Twelve studies were not included in the meta-analysis for the following reasons: five fMRI (Morrison et al.,  ; Groussard et al.,  ; Sammler et al.,  ; Herholz et al.,  ; Karmonik et al.,  ) and two PET (Satoh et al.,  ; Saito et al.,  ) did not include the contrast of interest; five ERP studies (Arikan et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ; Daltrozzo et al.,  ; Partanen et al.,  ; Chien and Chan,  ) did not report the coordinates. \n  \nList of the 23 studies, fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the systematic review. \n  \n n.a, not available; y, years  . \n  \n\n#### Inclusion in the meta-analysis \n  \nEleven studies (ten fMRI and one PET) involving 212 participants and 145 foci qualified for the meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach (Table  ).

Using the ALE approach, we expected to determine the core regions implicated in familiarity and unfamiliarity in music listening. \n\n\n#### Contrast 1: familiar music minus unfamiliar music \n  \nIn total, 10 studies (Plailly et al.,  ; Nan et al.,  ; Watanabe et al.,  ; Janata,  ; Klostermann et al.,  ; Groussard et al.,  ; Pereira et al.,  ; Altenm\u00fcller et al.,  ; Jacobsen et al.,  ; Sikka et al.,  ) were included. This meta-analysis was conducted on 128 activation foci involving 196 participants (Table  ). \n  \nTypes of contrasts of the 11 studies included in the meta-analyses. \n  \n PET, Positron emission tomography; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; n.a., not available; CRs, correct rejections; 1 - contrast analysis (familiar music minus unfamiliar music); 2 - contrast analysis (unfamiliar music minus familiar music)  . \n  \n\n#### Contrast 2: unfamiliar music minus familiar music \n  \nFour studies (Plailly et al.,  ; Demorest et al.,  ; Pereira et al.,  ; Altenm\u00fcller et al.,  ) with a total of 5 experiments, were included. This meta-analysis was conducted on 17 activation foci involving 61 participants (Table  ). \n\n\n\n### Results of the ALE meta-analysis \n  \nWhen adopting the threshold for statistical significance corrected for multiple comparisons (using FWE), we did not observe any significant activation for contrast 1 (familiar music minus unfamiliar music), or for contrast 2 (unfamiliar music minus familiar music). We then used uncorrected   P-  value method, but choosing a conservative threshold,   p   < 0.001. \n\n#### Contrast 1: familiar music minus unfamiliar music \n  \nResults of this ALE analysis yielded 37 regions with a significant likelihood (ranging from 0.009 to 0.017) of showing brain activation related to familiarity. The greatest likelihood that activation would be evoked in response to familiar music stimuli was in the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area (BA) 6; ALE = 0.017), the ventral lateral nucleus of the left thalamus (ALE = 0.015), followed by the left medial frontal gyrus, commonly referred to as the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus (BA 6; ALE = 0.015).

Table   provides the full list of ALE peaks for this map. \n  \n\n\n### Overview of ERP findings \n  \nOur search found five ERP articles, which were published between 1999 and 2015. Regarding the first two studies, Arikan et al. ( ) and Zhu et al. ( ), argued that hearing music of a familiar style increased the allocation of attentional resources during memory updating processes, demonstrated by an increase of P300 (P3) amplitude in frontal areas. Moreover, Zhu et al. ( ) showed a difference in N1 (negative component related to selective attention at an early stage of processing) and later positive complex (LPC; including P300 and P500) between culturally familiar and culturally unfamiliar music. \n\nDaltrozzo et al. ( ) recorded ERPs while participants listened to highly familiar and less familiar melodies in a gating paradigm. The ERPs time-locked to a tone of the melody called the \u201cfamiliarity emergence point\u201d (defined by Dalla Bella et al. ( ) as the number of tones required for the participant to consider the stimulus as familiar) showed a larger fronto-central negativity for highly familiar compared to less familiar melodies between 200 and 500 ms, with a peak latency around 400 ms. This component was suggested to be N400, a marker of conceptual processing. Overall, this study suggested that the feeling of music familiarity could be accompanied by the processing of the concepts conveyed by emotions to, or semantic associations with, the melody. \n\nPartanen et al. ( ) studied the neural correlates induced by prenatal music exposure using ERPs. After birth and at the age of 4 months, a modified melody was played while ERPs were recorded. Results showed that ERP amplitudes to the changed and unchanged notes of the melody were correlated with the amount of prenatal exposure, suggesting that prenatal exposure to a melody can have long-term plastic effects on the developing brain for at least 4 months. \n\nFinally, Chien and Chan ( ) also concentrated on the N400 wave, but focusing on familiarity effects on the processing of the meaning of lyrics in familiar and unfamiliar songs. Surprisingly, this process is not influenced at all by familiarity, unlike what happens with normal speech. Indeed, repetition usually leads to a decreased processing of meaning (described as \u201csemantic satiation\u201d), but this phenomenon was not observed with song lyrics. Therefore, it would seem that normal speech and lyrics are processed differently, at least at higher levels; in other words, the presence of a melody seems to influence how words are processed. \n\nIn sum, ERP studies have suggested an increased attention in frontal brain areas, around 400 ms, when listening to familiar music, and prenatal exposure to a melody can induce neural representations that last for 4 months. Supplementary Table   summarizes the outcome measures and main findings of the ERP studies. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and ALE meta-analysis investigating the neural correlates of familiar and unfamiliar music listening. In the following sections we will discuss our findings with respect to familiar and unfamiliar music processing proposals in the literature. \n\n### Overview of ALE meta-analysis findings (fMRI and PET studies) \n  \n#### Meta-analysis of activation evoked by familiar music \n  \nLiterature on \u201cthe mere exposure\u201d effect has shown that prior familiarity tends to increase likeability for a stimulus. Moreover, familiarity in music has been reported as an important factor modulating emotional and hedonic responses in the brain (Pereira et al.,  ). For this reason, we expected emotion and reward brain structures to be the top clusters consistently active in the condition of listening to familiar music. To our surprise, the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) had the highest likelihood of being activated. This brain area has been previously implicated in the processing of musical semantic memory (Platel,  ). It may underlie a top-down approach for intentional retrieval of prior episodes or items, selecting them from the semantic memory (Schott et al.,  ; Binder and Desai,  ). \n\nThe ventral lateral (VL) nucleus of the left thalamus had the second highest likelihood of being active in listening to familiar music. This is a motor first-order relay nucleus, which receives input from the substantia nigra, from the internal globus pallidus, and also from the contralateral cerebellum. It also has reciprocal connections with the motor and premotor cortex (Snell,  ). Three articles (Janata,  ; Pereira et al.,  ; Altenm\u00fcller et al.,  ) contributed to this result. It has been reported by Janata ( ) that the cerebellum is involved in music response planning. Possibly the brain prepares itself to react to music through dance and moves to the beat. Pereira et al. ( ) suggested that, like the putamen, the increased thalamic activity for familiar music could be associated with motor synchronization to the rhythms of the music excerpts, possibly reflecting top-down feedback due to anticipation of the familiar tune. Central thalamus activation seems to regulate attentional resources in task performance, even for very simple tasks, possible through continuing changes in motivation and arousal (Schiff et al.,  ). \n\nAs for cluster number 3, the left medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus, it has also been reported in two studies (Pereira et al.,  ; Sikka et al.,  ). This area (  x   = 0:   y   = 0;   z   = 64) can also be labeled as supplementary motor area (SMA) and Brodmann area 6. Pereira et al. ( ) interpreted activations in the SMA by suggesting that the subjects might have mentally sung along with the familiar songs. Halpern and Zatorre ( ) and Halpern ( ) suggested that the SMA is activated during musical imagery, like a sing-along response in one's mind or by anticipating melodic, harmonic progressions, rhythms, timbres, and lyric events in the familiar songs. It is not surprising that passive listening of familiar songs can recruit motor areas of the brain. In fact, auditory and motor systems interact closely during both music perception and production. It has been previously demonstrated that the basal ganglia, cerebellum, dorsal premotor cortex, and SMA are often implicated during music listening (Zatorre et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). \n\nNan et al. ( ) suggested that familiar music could be more appealing than unfamiliar songs and increased attention could be the reason for increased activation in motor areas. Rauschecker ( ) proposed an auditory processing model with an antero-ventral and a postero-dorsal streams. According to this hypothesis, the dorsal stream may play a role in auditory-motor transformations, and the premotor cortex and basal ganglia may be recruited when incoming sounds match expectations based on previous learned ones. \n\nLiterature on musical repetition has explored how increased motor activation can aid enjoyment. In her book,   On Repeat  , Margulis ( ) cites Bruno Nettl ( ), an ethnomusicologist who identifies musical repetition as a universal characteristic \u201cshared across music,\u201d (p.19) and Fitch ( ), an evolutionary biologist who calls repetition a \u201cdesign feature of music\u201d (p.5). Margulis ( ) theorizes that repetition plays a special role in music. As passive music listening recruits motor areas of the brain, Margulis hypothesizes that repeated musical passages are procedurally encoded as chunked automatic sequences, activating motoric basal ganglia. This enhances a listener's ability to automatically anticipate what notes are coming next, without attentional control. As music is repeated and encoded more and more as a fluid sequenced unit, it serves as a hook, compelling a person to execute the sequence imaginatively, without effort. The author suggests that listening to repeated music allows suppression of explicit thought and an increased sense of bodily involvement with the music. Ultimately, this gives a sense of pleasure and transcendence by participation or affiliation with the music (p.12, 67\u201369, 74). \n\nThe notion of musical expectation has been a central issue in music theory, cognition, and aesthetics (Huron,  ; Huron and Margulis,  ). Meyer ( ) postulated that expectations play an important role in emotional experiences during music listening. When listening to a musical piece, people can extract implicit, generalized knowledge of musical rules (Tillmann,  ). This abstract knowledge, also called structural knowledge by Bharucha ( ), allows listeners to create temporal expectancies. The confirmation or violation of the expectancies influences cognitive and emotional experience. Furthermore, anticipation may also arise if one is familiar with the music, and this aspect has been labeled as veridical knowledge by Bharucha ( ). \n\nTaking together, results from previous ERP studies and from this ALE analyses showed that frontal brain areas seemed to be important in the processing of familiar music. \n\nDespite theories demonstrating familiarity increasing pleasurability and liking, there was not much evidence that limbic engagement was modulated by familiarity in this ALE meta-analysis. One possible explanation for this is that ALE analysis is dependent on the coordinates from the original studies, the majority of them did not report limbic structures in their results. Either the music stimuli used were not highly familiar to subjects, or pleasure in music listening was not tied to explicit familiarity. \n\n\n#### Contrast 2: meta-analysis of activation evoked by unfamiliar music \n  \nWe explored common brain regions activated by unfamiliar music\/tones and found a consistent pattern of activation in the left insula. The insular cortex is associated with cognitive, emotional and regulatory processing, self-awareness and evaluative judgements (Menon and Uddin,  ; Brattico and Pearce,  ). The right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32) had the second and third highest likelihood of being active to unfamiliar music stimuli. This brain area has been implicated in processing emotional salience and motivational aspects of movement (Snell,  ). Pereira et al. ( ) states that the anterior cingulate cortex has been associated with the judgement of beauty in visual domain studies (Kawabata and Zeki,  ; Kirk et al.,  ). Other authors, such as Copland et al. ( ) noted that the right anterior cingulate (ACC) is involved in the detection of a prime target relationship. The cingulate gyrus cortex, along with the prefrontal cortex and cuneus, has also been implicated in episodic memory processing for music (Platel et al.,  ; Platel,  ). In the studies included in this meta-analysis the activation of the ACC might have been associated with successful detection of familiar or unfamiliar song or tones, as subjects had to decide on familiarity. According to Plailly et al. ( ) \u201cthe feeling of unfamiliarity refers to the absence of feeling of familiarity.\u201d In sum, the brain regions found to be more active when listening to unfamiliar songs may be related either with the \u201crecognition of the songs or the detection of novelty\u201d (Pereira et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Limitations and future work \n  \nDespite the novel findings of the current study, there are several shortcomings to be addressed. \n\nThe first one is that our results lacked significance after correcting for multiple comparisons using FWE and FDR methods and, therefore, are based on conservative but uncorrected p values. As previously mentioned, this is still a valid method described in the GingerALE 2.3 user manual and used in Turkeltaub et al. ( ) study. The second limitation is the small number of studies (n = 11) included in this meta-analysis, limiting the statistical power and sensitivity to detect a common neural mechanism for the listening of familiar music\/tones. \n\nThe third limitation is related to the statistical robustness of the original studies. Only four of the studies were corrected for multiple comparisons. All other studies reported uncorrected p values (Table  ). We are aware that lenient thresholds (such as   p   < 0.01;   p   < 0.0025 or   p   < 0.001 uncorrected) used in seven of the original studies would have resulted in a larger number of reported foci. In previous versions of GingerALE's methods the number of foci and their proximity of an experiment would determine a greater contribution of that experiment to an ALE map. Consequently, this would give stronger influence to less strict studies (Laird et al.,  ). In version 2.0 GingerALE switched and improved its methods. The modified ALE algorithm eliminated within-experiment effects (Turkeltaub et al.,  ) and incorporated variable uncertainty based on subject size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). As seen in Table  , the first three studies with greater number of foci included in this meta-analysis used uncorrected p values (please see Table  ). These were Janata ( ), Sikka et al. ( ), and Klostermann et al. ( ). These studies contributed with experiments only for the familiar music minus unfamiliar music contrast and did not have any influence in the meta-analysis of the unfamiliar music. Supplementary Table   displays the original studies contributing to each resulting cluster of the ALE method. Janata and Sikka et al. have undoubtedly contributed for the top results of activation evoked by familiar music, but as mentioned above, the sample size in those studies was the weighting factor in the ALE algorithm and not the number of foci. \n\nFourth, heterogeneity in the type of task and stimuli complexity used across studies may have played an important role in the present results as tasks both with and without lyrics were employed by the original studies. Due to the fact that there were few studies with lyrics within each contrast of interest and consequently lower statistical power, we did not perform separated ALE analyses for studies with and without lyrics. However, we explored whether the overall circuitry would be different if we removed the three studies with lyrics from the ALE analysis. The new ALE analysis eliminated the Superior Frontal Gyrus (a brain region associated with the processing of semantic memory), but the overall brain regions between the studies are highly overlapping, although the order is different. For completeness of reporting, we provide the results table in Supplementary Table  . \n\nFinally, even though participants in the studies included in the meta-analysis were all non-musicians, half of the studies enrolled participants with musical training. It is known that musical training can change children's brain structure (Hyde et al.,  ). Musicians, compared to non-musicians have better auditory skills, such a larger auditory working memory (Parbery-Clark et al.,  ) and enhanced auditory attention (Strait et al.,  ). Therefore, future studies need to account for stimuli complexity, presence or absence of lyrics, subject characteristics, and music expertise. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThere is a large body of literature highlighting the importance of familiarity and repetition in aesthetics experiences of music. In this study, we have systematically reviewed the literature on the neural correlates of familiarity or repeated exposure of music listening in adult healthy participants. We did not find significant, consistent peak activations among included studies. We had expected limbic structures as top clusters when listening to familiar music. Using a less conservative approach we found, instead, that music familiarity and repetition had a motor pattern of activation. \n\nThe implications of this work highlight the need for further larger better-powered studies with more consideration for the nature of the music stimuli and prior music training. The understanding of the neural correlates of music familiarity has the potential to be useful for neurorehabilitation. Future studies involving clinical populations could be optimized and targeted to provide therapeutic support in patients with Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, and those with severe verbal memory and motor deficits, and language impairments. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nCF, JL, and EA conceived and designed the study. CF, EM, and AB performed the literature selection, data analysis and results interpretation. CF wrote the manuscript. MT, JL, and EA critically revised the work. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nEA has received consultation fees (Roche and Takeda), industry funding (SynapDx and Sanofi-Aventis), royalties (APPI and Springer International Publishing), and editorial honorarium from Wiley. The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6183416,"text_md5":"67fb27f031c4f7af304a946f67e2af5b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,124],"journal":[125,139],"publication_year":[141,145],"title":[156,261],"keywords":[275,349],"abstract":[362,2765],"body":[2774,42866]},"batch":2,"pmid":30344470,"doi":"10.3389\/fnins.2018.00686","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6183416","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6183416"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6183416\">6183416<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6183416  Neural Correlates of Familiarity in Music Listening: A Systematic Review and a Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis"}

For example, under some conditions, patients with cerebellar damage are impaired at visuomotor adaptation and at acquiring new action sequences. Moreover, cerebellar activation has been observed in functional MRI (fMRI) investigations of various motor learning tasks. The early phases of motor learning are cognitively demanding, relying on processes such as working memory, which have been linked to the cerebellum as well. Here, we investigated cerebellar contributions to motor learning using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. This allowed us to determine, across studies and tasks, whether or not the location of cerebellar activation is constant across differing motor learning tasks, and whether or not cerebellar activation in early learning overlaps with that observed for working memory. We found that different regions of the anterior cerebellum are engaged for implicit and explicit sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation, providing additional evidence for the modularity of cerebellar function. Furthermore, we found that lobule VI of the cerebellum, which has been implicated in working memory, is activated during the early stages of explicit motor sequence learning. This provides evidence for a potential role for the cerebellum in the cognitive processing associated with motor learning. However, though lobule VI was activated across both early explicit sequence learning and working memory studies, there was no spatial overlap between these two regions. Together, our results support the idea of modularity in the formation of internal representations of new motor tasks in the cerebellum, and highlight the cognitive processing relied upon during the early phases of motor skill learning. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIndividuals are able to learn to use new tools and can turn novel movements into accomplished skills through practice. This process recruits a diverse network of cortical and subcortical brain regions (Jenkins et al.,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ; Doyon et al.,  ; Leh\u00e9ricy et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ), though the neural substrates vary somewhat based on task type (c.f. Rauch et al.,  ; Honda et al.,  ; Schendan et al.,  ). Several different paradigms have been used to investigate motor skill learning. These commonly include visuomotor adaptation and motor sequence learning. Visuomotor adaptation requires individuals to adapt movements to distorted visual feedback (e.g., Imamizu et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ). The sensory information provided to the participant does not match the movement they have made, and as such the participant needs to modify their movement to produce the appropriate result. Motor sequence learning requires individuals to learn novel patterns of movements, often made with the fingers (Figure  ). Based on cues provided to the individual, a new movement sequence is practiced and learned. Within the domain of motor sequence learning both implicit and explicit paradigms are used (e.g., Schendan et al.,  ). During implicit sequence learning, the goal of learning a new sequence is unknown to the participants, and the sequence is often embedded within other movements. Conversely, during explicit sequence learning, the goal of learning the sequence is made clear at the outset of the task. One brain region that has been consistently implicated in motor learning is the cerebellum. Cerebellar activation has been observed in a variety of motor learning tasks including visuomotor adaptation (Imamizu et al.,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ) and both implicit and explicit motor sequence learning (Jenkins et al.,  ; Grafton et al.,  ; Leh\u00e9ricy et al.,  ; Orban et al.,  ). Cerebellar circuits have also been implicated in associative learning paradigms such as eye-blink conditioning (Woodruff-Pak et al.,  ,  ; Cheng et al.,  ). \n  \n (A)   Schematic of a standard sequence learning task. Stimuli corresponding to buttons on a response box or keyboard are presented on a computer screen. The sequence is presented by highlighting a location, and the participant presents the corresponding button. Blocks alternate between sequence (S) presentations, and the presentation of locations in random order (R).   (B)   A schematic of a visuomotor adaptation task. Participants are presented with one of four targets on a computer screen, and are asked to move the cursor to the highlighted circle (top left). After several practice blocks, the feedback is rotated with respect to the participant's movement. Participants attempt to move toward the target in screen coordinates (TS), but due to the rotation subjects move toward the closed circle (TJ, target location in joystick coordinates), which is not visible to participants (top right). Direction error refers to the angle between the line from the center to the target and the line from the central to the location of the joystick at the time of peak velocity. This example is similar to what would be seen during early learning. In both panels, example data are presented. In the studies included in our meta-analysis, early and late learning were defined by the experimenters. Examples of the early and late learning phases for each task are highlighted in gray. \n  \nIn particular, the cerebellum is thought to play a role in the formation of internal representations of actions that allow for the smooth execution of motor skills (Ramnani,  ; Ito,  ). Learning and formation of these representations is thought to rely on error signals based on feedback from prior performance (Ito,  ). The result of this learning is a new internal model of a particular task. Indeed, the engagement of the cerebellum during the learning of a new motor task changes as the course of learning progresses (Imamizu et al.,  ). During a locomotor adaptation task, cerebellar excitability is decreased over the course of the task as measured by the degree of cerebellar brain inhibition of the motor cortex (Jayaram et al.,  ). Furthermore, the degree to which cerebellar brain inhibition decreased was strongly associated with learning of the locomotor adaptation task such that those with the greatest decreases in cerebellar excitability learned best. This decrease in excitability was suggested to be related to synaptic long-term depression (Jayaram et al.,  ). Also using non-invasive brain stimulation it has been demonstrated that the cerebellum is associated with the learning of a visuomotor adaptation task, while the primary motor cortex is associated with retention of learning (Galea et al.,  ). Relatedly, different neural substrates are engaged during performance of a task shortly after learning, including the cerebellum (Shadmehr and Holcomb,  ). This is indicative of changes in and consolidation of the internal model of a particular action. \n\nWith that in mind, one is likely to learn multiple motor skills. The question then becomes whether or not the cerebellum then forms distinct internal models for these different motor skills. It has previously been suggested that multiple internal models are present in the cerebellum. This has been conceptualized in the computational model know as MOdular Selection And Identification Controller (MOSAIC; Wolpert and Ghahramani,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ). Imamizu et al. ( ) tested this idea by having individuals learn to use a computer mouse under two novel visuomotor mappings. The visual feedback of the mouse was rotated, and in a separate condition, the velocity of the feedback was also manipulated. Over the course of learning in these two conditions, they found distinct regions of cerebellar activity, supporting modular internal models in the cerebellum (Imamizu et al.,  ). Imamizu and colleagues ( ) noted that this work serves as an extension of the MOSAIC theory in that the regions of cerebellar engagement associated with the internal models of these two conditions are in lateral regions of the cerebellum more associated with cognitive functions. Regardless, the MOSAIC theory can be further tested in the motor domain through the use of meta-analysis, as there are now numerous studies of motor learning across a variety of motor task domains. However, given the potential storage capacity issues with strictly modular representations of internal models, there may be overlapping cerebellar regions associated with motor tasks that require similar types of cognitive processing for learning, or are similar in task domain (for example, implicit and explicit sequence learning). \n\nIn addition to investigating the MOSAIC theory through the use of meta-analysis, this method also allows us to investigate the potential cognitive contributions of the cerebellum to motor learning. Compared to the more automatic performance that occurs in late learning, the early stage of learning is thought to be cognitively demanding (Fitts and Posner,  ). Indeed, the rate of early learning during a visuomotor adaptation task has been correlated with individual differences in spatial working memory ability, as measured using the card rotation task (Anguera et al.,  ). Furthermore, this work demonstrated that in this early learning phase, there is engagement of prefrontal and parietal brain regions that are also associated with the performance of a working memory task involving mental rotation (Anguera et al.,  ). Relatedly, visuospatial and verbal working memory have also been implicated in motor sequence learning. Visuospatial working memory capacity is correlated with explicit motor sequence learning and the formation of motor chunks (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ). In implicit sequence learning paradigms, both visuospatial and verbal working memory are correlated with improved performance (Bo et al.,  ,  ). Additionally, individuals with high working memory capacity learn sequences better when executive attention is required relative to those with low working memory capacity (Unsworth and Engle,  ). \n\nThe posterior and lateral regions of the cerebellum have been associated with the performance of working memory tasks (Chen and Desmond,  , ; Kirschen et al.,  ,  ; Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ,  ). While these regions have been investigated using working memory paradigms, it remains unknown whether the same sites are also engaged during the learning of new motor skills. Given that prefrontal and parietal regions associated with working memory are also engaged during early visuomotor adaptation learning (Anguera et al.,  ), the same may be true for the cerebellum. Though more lateral regions of the cerebellum have been recently implicated in complex motor tasks (Schlerf et al.,  ), perhaps due to the cognitive demands of those tasks, there have been no investigations of whether the same cerebellar regions are engaged for both working memory and motor skill learning. Again, meta-analysis allows for assessment of this question. \n\nHere our goal was to investigate the cerebellar contributions to both sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning. Cerebellar activation has been seen in implicit and explicit sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation, along with both spatial and verbal working memory (Hazeltine et al.,  ; Thomas et al.,  ; Daselaar et al.,  ; Haaland et al.,  ; Krakauer et al.,  ; Chen and Desmond,  , ; Leh\u00e9ricy et al.,  ; Seidler et al.,  ; Anguera et al.,  ; Schendan and Stern,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ). Given that working memory capacity is correlated with these three types of learning (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ,  ), it may be the case that a single cerebellar modular region underlies all three types of learning. Though the cerebellum and basal ganglia show dissociated activity in the later stages of learning, both are active in the earlier stages of learning for both sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation (Doyon and Benali,  ). One possibility is that the overlapping neural substrates of learning in the cerebellum may be due to the involvement of the cerebellum in working memory processes, particularly given that working memory is important for both sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ,  ). However, because cerebellar engagement changes over the time course of learning (Imamizu et al.,  ,  ), it may be oversimplified to look at just general overlap across these task types. Thus, we will investigate overlap in cerebellar activation across studies for working memory tasks with that of explicit sequence learning, implicit sequence learning, and visuomotor adaptation, taking into account the stages of learning (early vs. late) whenever possible. This approach will help to refine our view of cerebellar functions and modularity for cognitive and motor behaviors. In particular, investigations of the early and late stages of learning will provide further insight into the formation of internal models and allow for an additional test of the MOSAIC theory (Wolpert and Ghahramani,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ) in the motor domain. \n\nWe used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ), implemented using the GingerALE software package, to investigate the cerebellar regions involved in both motor sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation as well as working memory. Given the number of task domains, and the time necessary to assess learning, it would be extremely challenging to investigate all of these tasks in one functional neuroimaging study in order to answer the questions at hand. Meta-analysis, however, provides a reasonable solution. ALE meta-analysis pools coordinates in standard space across studies, and treats them as spatial probability distributions. Overlap among these regions is assessed through permutation testing, and the result is an ALE statistic for regions across studies with significant overlap (thresholded and corrected for multiple comparisons; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Studies demonstrating cerebellar activation during visuomotor adaptation, explicit and implicit sequence learning, as well as both spatial and verbal working memory tasks were combined in this meta-analysis. We hypothesized that visuomotor adaptation and motor sequence learning would engage similar motor regions of the cerebellum during early learning, but additional distinct regions associated with spatial and verbal working memory processes, respectively, would be engaged as well. We further hypothesized that distinct regions of the cerebellum would be involved in the later stages of learning and the formation of internal models, consistent with the MOSAIC theory (Wolpert and Ghahramani,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ) which suggests a modular organization of representations in the cerebellum. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature review \n  \nPapers were identified through three PubMed ( ) searches. Searches for papers investigating visuomotor adaptation, motor sequence learning, and working memory were conducted separately using the following search terms: \u201csensorimotor adaptation AND imaging,\u201d \u201cmotor sequence learning AND imaging,\u201d and \u201cworking memory AND imaging.\u201d Additionally, the searches used the limits \u201cHumans,\u201d \u201cEnglish,\u201d and \u201cAdult 19-44 years.\u201d These searches resulted in 45, 149, and 1997 papers, respectively. We also consulted a recent review of motor learning and included related work on sensorimotor adaptation not found in our PubMed search (Seidler,  ). We followed the same exclusion criteria as reported by Stoodley and Schmahmann ( ). That is, we excluded papers that did not use functional imaging techniques, did not report any coordinates in the cerebellum, did not report coordinates in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI; Collins et al.,  ) or Talairach (Talairach and Tournoux,  ) space, investigations with incomplete coverage of the cerebellum, those using only region of interest analyses, and clinical or aging studies that did not report a healthy young adult control group. Additionally, we excluded studies where the learning of the adaptation task or sequence was completed outside of the scanner (that is, the early learning phase was not scanned), and those that did not have subjects overtly perform the task (e.g., studies that investigated mental rehearsal of a sequence and the resultant learning outcomes), along with studies that did not use standard contrast analyses (for example, those using independent components analysis). Studies of working memory were limited to the spatial and verbal domains, consistent with tasks found to be associated with motor learning (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ,  ). Thus, we excluded studies with emotional, auditory, and visual manipulations. After excluding studies that did not meet our criteria, 5 studies of visuomotor adaptation, 18 studies of sequence learning, and 44 studies of working memory remained (9 of spatial working memory, and 35 of verbal working memory). Finally, for our analyses of sequence learning, we divided our studies into those investigating implicit sequence learning (7 studies) and those investigating explicit sequence learning (the remaining 11 studies). Studies of explicit sequence learning were further divided, grouping those investigating early and late learning separately (5 studies in each category). The number of studies included in each of our task domains is consistent with the number of studies used in similar recent ALE meta-analyses of cerebellar function (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ; E et al.,  ). These investigations included between 2 studies (somatosensory task domain; Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) and 26 studies (working memory domain; E et al.,  ). Though our initial goal was to compare early and late learning across all three motor tasks, none of the studies meeting our criteria for both visuomotor adaptation and implicit sequence learning included analyses based on learning stage, and we were therefore unable to complete the analysis of learning stage on these two task domains. For explicit motor sequence learning, early and late learning were typically defined within a single practice session. The first half of learning was compared to the second half of learning. However, in one instance (van der Graaf et al.,  ) learning was compared across two sessions with practice occurring for several days in between the two sessions. Table   presents the studies included in our analyses, along with the sample size, imaging modality, the number of cerebellar foci, and a brief description of the tasks and contrasts resulting in those foci for each study. \n  \n Studies included in the meta-analysis, organized by category  . \n  \nThe sequence learning tasks required subjects to learn novel sequences of movements, typically through finger button presses. However, Albouy and colleagues ( ) investigated the implicit learning of a sequence of eye movements. In the implicit conditions, action sequences were often embedded in a larger set of movements so as to block explicit awareness of the task. Decreases in reaction time are indicative of learning during sequence blocks, relative to blocks where all button presses were random. Relatedly, a secondary task was also at times employed to further prevent participants from gaining explicit awareness of the sequence (Grafton et al.,  ). Under explicit learning conditions, participants were instructed that they would be learning a sequence and were aware of the task goals. \n\nVisuomotor adaptation paradigms take two main forms. Most commonly, participants manipulate a hand-held joystick in order to move a small object to a target location. After a practice period, the visual feedback is rotated such that the feedback on the screen does not match the movements of the joystick (c.f. Anguera et al.,  ). Alternatively, participants may also be instructed to make pointing movements to a target while wearing prism distortion goggles (Luaut\u00e9 et al.,  ). In both cases, the visual feedback of movement is distorted. \n\nIn both verbal and spatial working memory tasks participants have to hold and manipulate information in mind over a span of a few seconds. Two of the most commonly used tasks are the n-back task and the Sternberg working memory task. The n-back task can be administered using either verbal or spatial stimuli (c.f. Thomas et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ). In verbal tasks, letters (or numbers) are presented individually and subjects have to indicate whether the current letter matches what was presented \u201cn\u201d trials previously. In spatial tasks participants are asked to compare locations of stimuli across successive presentations. Also commonly used is the Sternberg working memory task (Sternberg,  ). In this paradigm groups of letters are presented. After a delay period participants are presented with a letter and are asked to indicate whether or not that letter was part of the previously viewed set. Additionally, the included studies also employed tests of mental rotation (spatial working memory) as well as paced addition tasks (verbal working memory). \n\nImportantly, across these task domains, participants were required to make their responses with the fingers and hand. The one exception was implicit sequence learning of eye movements (Albouy et al.,  ). In general, across domains the effectors used during the learning paradigms did not vary significantly. This is particularly important given the somatotopy within the cerebellum (Nitschke et al.,  ; Wiestler et al.,  ). Any differences in activation across these motor tasks cannot be attributed to differences in the effectors used in each task domain. With respect to working memory, all of the responses were made with the hands and fingers across tasks, although all of the studies included in our analyses also controlled for the motor responses. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis \n  \nAll analyses were completed using GingerALE 2.3 ( ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Foci within the cerebellum for each task type were combined into individual text files. Because all of the foci need to be in the same space, foci in Talairach space that were transformed using the Brett transform (mni2tal) were converted back to MNI space using the inverse of the Brett transform. Those that were transformed into Talairach space using the Lancaster transform (Lancaster et al.,  ; icbm2tal) were transformed back into MNI space, also using the inverse of this transform. Finally, in cases where there was no transform specified, or where data were initially normalized into Talairach space, the Lancaster icbm2tal transform was used to bring these foci into MNI space. Importantly, the icbm2tal is a newer transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ) and we were careful to ensure that this was used only on studies where it would have been initially available. Older work transformed with icbm2tal was restricted to studies that were initially normalized directly into Talairach space. These transformations were completed using the \u201cconvert foci\u201d tool in GingerALE. Foci in MNI space within the cerebellum for each task type were combined into individual text files. \n\nThe text files were then entered into GingerALE. GingerALE automatically computes the ALE values for every voxel in the brain, and does so using an automatically determined full-width half-maximum (FWHM) value (Eickhoff et al.,  ). However, upon completion of the analyses, the FWHM value of each focus was reported to be between 9 and 10 mm. The ALE value was computed using permutation testing (5000 permutations) against the null-distribution of random spatial associations of foci across experiments (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The ALE scores resulting from this permutation testing are then used to assign   p  -values to the actual values of the input data. We used a false discovery rate of   p   < 0.05 to correct for multiple comparisons. Additionally, all clusters were set to a minimum of 50 mm . We completed ALE analyses for visuomotor adaptation, explicit sequence learning, implicit sequence learning, spatial working memory, and verbal working memory. We completed additional ALE analyses on the subset of explicit motor sequence learning studies that looked at activation during the early and late stages of learning. Notably, because we were generally interested in the regions involved in motor learning, areas that showed decreases in activation over the course of learning were considered with those that showed increases in activation. While most studies specifically investigated increases in activation, there were a few investigations of decreases in activation, though there were not a sufficient number of foci to investigate these decreases separately. \n\nGingerALE also allows for statistical comparisons between the ALE maps of two distinct sets of foci. We used this method to investigate areas of overlap between task domains. We were particularly interested in the conjunction analyses across different tasks. Specifically, we investigated potential regions of overlap between visuomotor adaptation and all studies of sequence learning (combining both explicit and implicit studies), visuomotor adaptation and spatial working memory, explicit sequence learning and verbal working memory, all sequence learning and verbal working memory, and the early and late phases of learning during explicit sequence learning. This was computed using 5000 permutations, and we again used a false discovery rate of   p   < 0.05 and minimum cluster size of 50 mm . \n\nThe results were visualized using MRICron ( ) and overlaid on an MNI template brain. The peaks of the ALE clusters were localized using the (Schmahmann et al.,  ) atlas of the human cerebellum. Because we were combining studies using standard normalization procedures, we were unable to use the recently developed SUIT atlas (Diedrichsen,  ; Diedrichsen et al.,  ). The implications of older cerebellar templates and standard normalization procedures are addressed further in the discussion. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE peaks for motor learning and working memory tasks \n  \nTable   presents the peak coordinates, weighted centers, cluster sizes, and anatomical locations for the significant ALE maxima across each task domain. Figure   presents the ALE activation maps for visuomotor adaptation, explicit and implicit sequence learning, and spatial and verbal working memory. Figure   presents the ALE activation maps for early and late explicit sequence learning. \n  \n Peak ALE coordinates for each task category  . \n    \n Significant ALE clusters of activation for each examined task type are presented on coronal (left) and axial (right) slices of the cerebellum.   All clusters are thresholded and corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate   p   < 0.05. VMA, visuomotor adaptation; ISL, implicit sequence learning; ESL, explicit sequence learning; VWM, verbal working memory; SWM, spatial working memory; CRI, Crus I. \n    \n Significant ALE clusters of activation for the early (red) and late (blue) phases of explicit sequence learning presented on coronal (left) and axial (right) slices of the cerebellum.   All clusters are thresholded and corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate   p   < 0.05. \n  \nThough we were unable to investigate early vs. late learning activation in the visuomotor adaptation task, analysis of activations across the entire learning period resulted in one significant cluster in the anterior cerebellum, localized in lobule IV. Also located in the anterior lobe was a significant cluster associated with implicit sequence learning. However, this cluster was located along the midline in the vermis region of lobule V. \n\nWhen combining across all studies and phases of learning, explicit sequence learning was associated with a large cluster in the vermis region of lobule VI, extending into lobule VI itself. During the early phase of explicit sequence learning there were two significant ALE clusters. One cluster was located more medially in the vermis region of lobule VI and extended laterally into lobule VI. The second cluster was located more laterally, and was inferior to the first cluster in lobule VI. During the late phase of explicit sequence learning, the activation was again more medial in the vermis of lobule VI and extending into lobule VI itself. \n\nFinally, we investigated both spatial and verbal working memory. Spatial working memory processing activated a cluster in the left cerebellum in lobule VI, while verbal working memory processing activated a large cluster in the right cerebellum on the border between lobule VI and Crus I. These findings closely replicate those described by the meta-analysis performed by Stoodley and Schmahmann ( ), and are also consistent with the functional topography of the cerebellum that has been demonstrated using functional neuroimaging (Stoodley et al.,  ,  ). Notably, there were no clusters in the inferior regions of the cerebellum as reported in recent meta-analyses (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ; E et al.,  ). In part, this may be due to the number of additional studies included in our analysis [44 working memory studies, compared to the 8 and 26 used by Stoodley and Schmahmann ( ) and E et al. ( ), respectively]. Furthermore, this inferior region was associated most strongly with the Sternberg task (E et al.,  ), as evidenced by comparisons across working memory tasks. Though many of the studies in our analyses employed variants of the Sternberg task, there were additional working memory tasks included, perhaps resulting in our null finding in the inferior cerebellum. \n\n\n### Analysis of overlap across tasks \n  \nConjunction analyses across sets of foci were carried out to investigate overlapping regions of the cerebellum across tasks. We investigated overlap between visuomotor adaptation and sequence learning (collapsing across all implicit and explicit studies), visuomotor adaptation and spatial working memory, all sequence learning and verbal working memory, explicit sequence learning and verbal working memory, and the early and late stages of explicit sequence learning. There was no significant overlap between any of these sets of foci with the exception of the early and late stages of explicit sequence learning. There was a significant cluster of overlap in the vermis region of lobule VI associated with both early and late explicit sequence learning (Table  , Figure  ). However, there was no overlap between late learning and the more lateral lobule VI cluster associated with early explicit sequence learning. \n  \n Overlap of regions engaged during the early and late phases of explicit sequence learning  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing ALE meta-analysis, we investigated cerebellar involvement in multiple motor learning tasks, including visuomotor adaptation and both explicit and implicit motor sequence learning. We further investigated cerebellar regions associated with working memory processes and their potential involvement in motor learning. Our results provide evidence consistent with the role of the anterior cerebellum in motor tasks, though our findings did not indicate overlapping engagement of cerebellar regions for both working memory processes and motor learning. The anterior cerebellum, particularly along the midline, was active across studies of explicit and implicit sequence learning, with an additional anterior region associated with visuomotor adaptation. The distinct regions associated with these motor tasks provide conceptual support for the MOSAIC theory (Wolpert and Ghahramani,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ) of modular internal models in the cerebellum. Additionally, we provide support for the involvement of more lateral and posterior regions of the cerebellum in explicit sequence learning. This is consistent with prior work indicating an additional homunculus in this region associated with the performance of complex motor tasks (Schlerf et al.,  ). However, notably, we found no overlap between regions associated with spatial and verbal working memory processes and any of the motor learning tasks we investigated, despite our previous work demonstrating correlations between an individual's working memory capacity and their motor learning of these tasks (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ,  ). \n\n### The cerebellum and internal models of action \n  \nIt has been proposed that the cerebellum is important for the formation of internal models of actions (Miall et al.,  ; Miall and Wolpert,  ; for reviews see Ramnani,  ; Ito,  ). According to the MOSAIC theory, these internal models are modularly represented in the cerebellum for motor actions as well as cognitive processes (Wolpert and Ghahramani,  ; Imamizu et al.,  ). Supporting this theory, we found that cerebellar activation was distinct for each of multiple motor learning task types. \n\nWith that said, it is important to note that in both implicit sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation, we were unable to subdivide the collected foci into the early and late phases of learning. We were therefore unable to investigate differences in the activated regions that would be indicative of the formation of new internal models of the learned skills. One alternative possibility is that the different regions of activation across tasks were due to the motor somatotopy within the anterior cerebellum (Nitschke et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ; Wiestler et al.,  ). There is a general body representation within this region; even individual finger representations can be discerned (Wiestler et al.,  ). The distinct regions may be due to the overall motor demands of the learning tasks, and variability may be associated with different effector usage for task performance. For example, sequence learning tasks typically involved tapping with individual fingers, whereas visuomotor adaptation often required the manipulation of a joystick with either several fingers or the whole hand. As such, distinct anterior cerebellar regions may have been engaged. \n\nLastly with respect to the localization of these activations, across these motor tasks activity across studies was generally confined to anterior regions of the cerebellum. This is consistent with the functional topography of the cerebellum wherein motor representations are located in the anterior cerebellum, as well as in lobules VIIIa and VIIIb in the posterior cerebellum (Schmahmann and Sherman,  ; Gerwig et al.,  ; Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ,  ). Though we did not see any activation clusters in the secondary, more posterior motor representation, it has recently been suggested that the function of the posterior region is different than that of the anterior motor representation, and it may be less important for motor control (Donchin et al.,  ). Additionally, our midline clusters associated with both implicit and explicit sequence learning are in a cerebellar region where gray matter volume has been linked to the degree to which individuals learn a new motor sequence (Steele et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Working memory and motor learning in the cerebellum \n  \nAs the early stage of learning is thought to rely on cognitive processes (Fitts and Posner,  ; Anderson,  ), we predicted that there would be overlap between areas engaged in spatial and verbal working memory and those associated with motor learning. However, this was not supported by the results. This is somewhat surprising given the relationship between working memory capacity and both sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation (Bo and Seidler,  ; Bo et al.,  ,  ,  ; Anguera et al.,  ), and the recruitment of neural resources associated with working memory during the early phase of visuomotor adaptation (Anguera et al.,  ). \n\nLateral and posterior cerebellar regions are thought to communicate with the prefrontal cortex through closed loop circuits (Ramnani,  ). These regions are also implicated in both spatial and verbal working memory tasks as demonstrated in our analyses, consistent with prior work (Chen and Desmond,  , ; Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ,  ). One may then imagine that if working memory circuits are engaged during the early phases of motor learning, the cerebellar components of those circuits may also be brought online. In fact, in learning novel skills that may require more cognitive resources, new internal models are formed, but they seem to be in more lateral regions of the cerebellum (Imamizu et al.,  ,  ). Perhaps, because we were unable to differentiate between the early and late learning phases in the visuomotor adaptation task and in implicit sequence learning, we were unable to differentiate regions that may be associated with more general motor execution from those associated with the formation of a new internal model. Similarly, in our analyses we treated regions that showed decreases in activation over the course of learning in the same way as those that showed parametric increases in activation over the course of learning. A greater number of foci in each category would allow for differentiation and may indicate that areas of decrease are associated with the cognitive demands of early learning (Anguera et al.,  ), while those that exhibit increases may be more associated with the formation of new internal models. \n\nWe were able to investigate the early and late phases of explicit sequence learning. During the early phase of learning there were two significant cerebellar clusters, one of which was more lateral and inferior in lobule VI. Though there was no overlap with regions associated with either spatial or verbal working memory, this region is consistent with an area reported to show increased activation during the performance of more complex motor tasks (Schlerf et al.,  ). In this investigation during the complex task participants executed sequences of finger flexion and extension. This was compared to a simple task requiring the simultaneous flexion and extension of multiple digits at once. In our data, as with those of Schlerf and colleagues ( ), activity was localized in lobule VI. Lobule VI has been implicated in working memory task performance (Chen and Desmond,  , ), and the resting state networks of this region include correlations with both pre-motor and lateral prefrontal cortical regions (Bernard et al.,  ). Thus, though the activation in lobule VI associated with early explicit sequence learning does not directly overlap with those associated with verbal or spatial working memory, lobule VI does seem to be involved in higher cognitive processing. However, given that we averaged across multiple studies and foci, there may be some overlap on an individual study level. Our cluster in this region associated with early explicit sequence learning may therefore reflect some of the cognitive demands associated with this stage of motor skill learning. Finally, the more superior and medial early learning cluster overlapped with that of late learning. This may be more indicative of a newly formed internal model. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe use of meta-analysis to investigate activations across studies has some limitations. First is that of study selection. While we defined our study selection criteria based on age and study parameters to eliminate any potential bias, there may be additional available studies that merit inclusion but were not found based on our search terms. Our results are limited to those studies that are available in Pubmed within our given search parameters. Furthermore, a variety of different tasks have been used to investigate working memory and motor learning. For example, verbal working memory may be measured using an n-back task, a Sternberg task, or the paced auditory serial addition task. Because we were interested in the general processes, and not the specific tasks themselves we collapsed across these task types. Notably, there was less variability across sequence learning tasks and visuomotor adaptation paradigms, but this may still impact our results. \n\nSecond, combining multiple studies means that data are often normalized to different brain templates, or normalized and transformed from one template to another. Though algorithms are available to bring data across several studies into the same anatomical space, perfect registration across subjects cannot be guaranteed. Relatedly, the acquisition and other processing parameters vary across these studies. Indeed, because we included both PET and fMRI results in our analysis, this is particularly pertinent. Importantly however, the ALE algorithm employed here includes random-effects modeling designed to account at least in part for these limitations (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nLastly, it is worth noting that the studies included in this meta-analysis relied primarily on standard affine transformations for normalization. These methods implemented in common neuroimaging packages often result in poor alignment between cerebellar regions (Diedrichsen,  ). Recently, Diedrichsen and colleagues have created a spatially-unbiased atlas and updated normalization procedure to improve cerebellar registration (Diedrichsen,  ; Diedrichsen et al.,  ). Because of the relative novelty of this normalization procedure and the span of time over which our studies originate, use of this procedure was rare in the studies we sampled. Most of the investigations we included used more standard normalization parameters and templates. Thus, our results should be interpreted with some caution as the actual locations may vary slightly due to normalization procedures. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nHere, we investigated the role of the cerebellum in motor skill learning using ALE meta-analysis. We combined foci across studies investigating visuomotor adaptation, motor sequence learning (explicit and implicit), and verbal and spatial working memory. We demonstrated that distinct motor tasks engaged differing regions of the cerebellum, providing further evidence for the notion that the internal models of the cerebellum are formed in a modular manner. Furthermore, these regions were generally limited to the anterior portion of the cerebellum, consistent with its general functional topography. Additionally, we also found that although the cerebellum seems to engage regions associated with the lateral prefrontal cortex and working memory performance during the early stage of explicit sequence learning, this region did not overlap with any of the significant ALE clusters associated with the working memory domains (verbal and spatial) that we investigated here. In general, this provides support for the role of the cerebellum in processing the cognitive demands of the early phases of sequence learning, but further investigations are needed to see if this generalizes to other domains of motor skill learning. In particular, more fine-grained studies investigating cerebellar functional modularity across tasks and their associated timecourses are warranted. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3566602,"text_md5":"a0a59953bb8f9379e5f1b8a859c80879","field_positions":{"authors":[0,43],"journal":[44,62],"publication_year":[64,68],"title":[79,178],"keywords":[192,272],"abstract":[285,2088],"body":[2097,43633]},"batch":2,"pmid":23403800,"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2013.00027","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3566602","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3566602"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3566602\">3566602<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3566602  Cerebellar contributions to visuomotor adaptation and motor sequence learning: an ALE meta-analysis"}

We aimed to identify abnormalities in the localized connectivity in schizophrenia patients and their relatives by conducting a meta-analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFourteen studies on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, with 316 schizophrenia patients, 342 healthy controls, and 66 unaffected relatives, were included in the meta-analysis.

Although the pathogenesis of schizophrenia has been explored in various fields such as in genetics  and neural biochemistry,  it is still undefined. Neuroimaging techniques have been extensively used to address the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disorder over the past decades.  Furthermore, the abnormality of neuroimaging endophenotypes in schizophrenia is an ideal marker for exploring the relationship of neurodevelopmental abnormalities with genetic and environmental risk factors. , \n\nApart from voxel-based structural neuroimaging and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies have been successfully applied to reveal regional activity and functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients. ,  In recent rs-fMRI studies, a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method was used to analyze the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in cerebrum, assume that a given voxel was temporally similar to those of its neighbors, and then finally reflect localized functional connectivity or synchronization of information processing. , \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies about localized connectivity in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives by ReHo analysis have revealed that several regions show abnormal synchronization compared with healthy controls. \u2013  However, the evidence is inconsistent. In addition, whether schizophrenia patients and these high-risk individuals (unaffected relatives) share neuropathological characteristics remains unclear. In the present study, we conducted a meta-analysis of these ReHo studies in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives and subsequently identified the changes in these endophenotypes in both individuals. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThe study was designed using a voxel-based meta-analysis based on clinical data of statistical maps and peak coordinates collected from previous case\u2013control trials of rs-fMRI regarding changes in localized connectivity in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. Two researchers (BX and JL) independently reviewed the literature and selected studies to use in the meta-analysis. Any disagreement was resolved through a group discussion. \n\n\n### Searching strategies \n  \nLiterature searches were performed in related databases, including PubMed, Google scholar, and CNKI, before October 2016. The following search terms were combined and used: \u201cschizophrenia\/schizophrenic\/SZ\/SCZ\u201d, \u201cfunctional MRI\/fMRI\u201d, \u201cregional homogeneity\/ReHo\/localized connectivity\/coherence\/concordance\u201d, and \u201crelative\/sibling\/twin\u201d. Publications from conferences, monographs, theses, or reference lists in identified studies were also regarded as potential sources to be included in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nAccording to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines,  the following criteria were used for inclusion in the meta-analysis: 1) whole-brain analysis was used in task-free rs-fMRI studies; 2) studies included a comparison of the localized connectivity between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls or between patients and their unaffected relatives or between relatives and controls; 3) the coordinates (either Talairach or Montreal Neurologic Institute) of altered brain regions were detailed; and 4) the publication was in English or Chinese. Meanwhile, the following studies were excluded: 1) ROI approaches and 2) studies not performed using rs-fMRI (eg, PET, DTI, and EEG). Two researchers (BX and JL) examined the abstract or full text of all searched articles to identify studies that fit the abovementioned criteria. When multiple studies used the same patient cohort, the one with the largest sample size was selected. \n\n\n### Data extraction and quality scores \n  \nTwo researchers (SW and TM) independently extracted data from the included studies. The general characteristics of each study, including the first author, year of publication, sample size, onset of disease, medication use, tesla of MRI, image package, full width at half maximum (FWHM), stereotactic space of coordinates, and the threshold, were extracted as the basic data. We also obtained voxel-based data, which included the peak coordinates and   t\/z   values of statistically significant differences in localized connectivity between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls or between unaffected relatives and healthy controls or between schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. Missing data were acquired from the corresponding authors of the study by email. If missing data cannot be acquired, the papers were excluded. Any disagreement about the data was resolved through group discussions with consensus. All data were checked for internal consistency. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using a checklist that focused on both the clinical and demographic aspects of individual study samples and the imaging-specific methodology used in the studies. ,  We also adopted recently established preprocessing and computational parameters. , \n\n\n### Anisotropic effect size-based signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis of rs-fMRI studies was performed using AES-SDM software, which has been previously used in several neuropsychiatric disorders. \u2013  AES-SDM software is a voxel-based meta-analytic approach that enabled the use of reported peak coordinates of localized functional connectivity difference in whole-brain studies.  The SDM method has been previously described. \n\nResearchers BX and YH performed the meta-analysis. The main threshold was set at uncorrected   P  <0.001 (empirically equivalent to   P  <0.05, corrected)  with   z   score >1 (peak height) and cluster extent \u226520 voxels. The default settings in the AES-SDM software were used for other parameters. A leave-one-out jackknife analysis was used to determine the sensitivity of the reported results to the inclusion of individual studies.  Heterogeneity among studies was assessed through the   Q   statistic with a threshold of   P  <0.05. Subgroup analysis was performed based on disease onset (first or not) and medicated status (medication-free or medicated). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Basic information of included studies \n  \nThe entire search process is as described in the QUOROM-type flowchart ( ). Fourteen rs-fMRI studies on localized functional connectivity met the inclusion criteria, 13 , , \u2013  of which were involved in schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls, three , ,  of which were involved in unaffected relatives vs healthy controls, and one  of which was involved in schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls. The overall sample was equivalent to a cohort of 316 schizophrenia patients, 342 healthy controls, and 66 unaffected relatives contributing data to the meta-analysis. The clinical information and quality scores of each study are detailed in   and  . All studies were from China and well matched in age and gender. \n\n\n### fMRI meta-analysis of the comparison between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls \n  \nResults of the comparison between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls from the AES-SDM analysis are summarized in   and  . The most robust findings revealed that schizophrenia patients had increased ReHo in right superior frontal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus, whereas decreased ReHo was noted in left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that all these results were highly replicable. Analysis of heterogeneity suggested that two regions (right superior frontal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus) with altered ReHo had significant statistical heterogeneity among included studies. Subgroup analysis further revealed that the first episode affected the altered ReHo in right superior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus, whereas drug-na\u00efve affected that in right superior frontal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. \n\n\n### fMRI meta-analysis of the comparison between unaffected relatives and healthy controls \n  \nResults of the comparison between unaffected relatives and healthy controls from the AES-SDM analysis are summarized in   and  . The most robust findings revealed that unaffected relatives only had decreased ReHo in right insula and right superior temporal gyrus. Jackknife sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses showed that the decreased ReHo in right superior temporal gyrus was highly replicable and consistent in the included studies. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe key finding of this meta-analysis was that schizophrenia patients exhibited a significantly increased ReHo in right superior frontal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus and decreased ReHo in left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus, whereas unaffected relatives showed decreased ReHo in right insula and right superior temporal gyrus. These changes were highly replicable in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Particularly, in both patients and unaffected relatives, no consistent region was found to be changed compared with controls, indicating that abnormal localized functional connectivity may be widely and uniquely distributed in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives during the resting-state. Two possible explanations may account for these results. 1) The disrupted localized connectivity in frontal and temporal cortex may be associated with the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, which are apparent only in patients; however, unaffected siblings are free from severe psychotic symptoms. Therefore, siblings may restrict to focal regions rather than large-scale changes in localized functional connectivity. 2) Siblings of schizophrenia patients, bearing less genetic burdens than the patient\u2019s discordant twins, only have 9% increased risk for the disease. This percentage may be inadequate for reflecting some brain abnormalities evidenced in patients. , \n\nPreviously, two meta-analyses of rs-fMRI studies have reported abnormal localized neural connections in schizophrenia. ,  K\u00fchn et al  found hypoactivation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, and lower precuneus and the precuneus, as well as hyperactivation in bilateral lingual gyrus of schizophrenic patients by using activation likelihood estimation. Li et al  performed a meta-analysis by using the Liptak\u2013Stouffer   z  -score method to summarize stage-specific functional connectivity changes in multiple centers. Their results suggest that first-episode patients have 82 functional connections significantly differing from controls, and 94% of these are in frontal lobe meta. However, chronic-stage patients show functional connectivity differences from controls that become much more widespread (with 162 altered links), with the most prominent ones being in thalamus bilaterally (58 links) and cingulate cortex (49 links). All three meta-analyses (K\u00fchn et al,  Li et al,  and the present study) have revealed abnormal localized functional connections in prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia patients, but our study further demonstrated its abnormalities in unaffected relatives and the surrounding of central lobule. We also calculated the effect size of each cluster with abnormal localized neural connection and included only rs-fMRI studies performed by using ReHo analysis, which can decrease heterogeneity results from methodology and may have advantages for reflecting the localized synchronization of information processing. ,  Our results were partially replicated in the abovementioned meta-analyses, and differences may result from our inclusion of recent studies by using ReHo analysis, the software used for the meta-analysis, and the particular parameter settings. Notably, the advantage of our meta-analysis was the systematic and comprehensive comparison among the three populations (ie, patients, unaffected relatives, and controls). \n\nSuperior temporal gyrus, a popular focus in studies on schizophrenia, may be the most interesting brain region in the present meta-analysis due to its changes in both the patients and unaffected relatives. Previous longitudinal MRI studies have reported a marked progressive decrease in superior temporal gyrus gray matter in both schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. \u2013  Our previous study on a single center has also demonstrated that schizophrenia patients have smaller gray matter volume and dysfunctional connectivity in superior temporal gyrus.  Partly consistent with previous inclusion studies, the present meta-analysis showed that schizophrenia patients had localized connectivity decreased in left superior temporal gyrus and increased in right superior temporal gyrus, whereas unaffected relatives had decreased localized connectivity in right superior temporal gyrus. These results suggested that patients and relatives did not share the same change in these brain regions. The abnormalities in the superior temporal gyrus may play a crucial role in defects of memory, language processing, and auditory in schizophrenia,  which may result from abnormal synaptic pruning and myelination during the neurodevelopmental process.  Hence, we infer that although schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives had different abnormalities of localized connectivity in the superior temporal gyrus, the pathogenesis of the disorder may also be involved in abnormal changes in synaptic pruning and myelination under the different stages and environments of the neurodevelopmental process. \n\nThe surroundings of central lobule may be the second most interesting brain regions in our meta-analysis. Cortical volume reduction in the paracentral and precentral lobule of the sensory and motor networks has been reported in schizophrenia patients. \u2013  Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenia patients had significantly reduced local functional connectivity density in paracentral lobule ,  but decreased ReHo values in precentral lobule, ,  which were consistent with the findings in the present work. Abnormalities in the surroundings of central lobule in schizophrenia patients suggested that sensorimotor cortex (SMC) may contribute to the development of the disorder. Dopaminergic terminals and receptors are known to be present in SMC  and have the effect of reducing SMC excitability,  suggesting that modulation may render SMC circuitry effective in processing sensory information. The abnormalities of localized connectivity in these regions in SMC may be associated with neurodevelopmental problems, such as neuronal overgrowth and a deficit in normal synaptic pruning during neurogenesis.  From infancy, through childhood and adolescence, and into adulthood, the structural and functional maturation of neural pathways clearly connects a set of specialized brain regions related to cognitive, motor, and sensory functions.  However, many different \u201cconnectivities\u201d occur during neurogenesis.  Previous studies have reported that neurodevelopment in youth is associated with increased distant connectivity and decreased local connectivity. ,  Furthermore, considering that schizophrenia is a disorder of neurodevelopment,  its disturbed neural connectivity is based on alterations in synaptic connection strength and indicates regional integration of information processing. ,  Hence, the abnormal localized functional connectivity in the surroundings of central lobule within SMC may be accompanied by a neural development process and contribute to the injured information processing in schizophrenia. \n\nOther uniquely regional changes in localized functional connectivity in patients or unaffected relatives, such as right superior frontal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and right insula, may also play key roles in the neuropathological endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Although the functionality of these brain regions is not fully understood, it has been linked with various neural pathways related to emotion, self-awareness, recognition, and so on, \u2013  which are impaired in schizophrenia patients. ,  In summary, our voxel-based meta-analyses identified several brain regions with abnormal localized functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients and their relatives. These abnormalities may reflect the neuropathological characteristics of this disorder and serve as a basis for establishing objective diagnostic markers for schizophrenia. Our results may also help identify the role of genetic and environmental factors in the abnormal neurodevelopment that occurs in schizophrenia. \n\nA few limitations exist in this study. 1) We did not include studies without coordinates or with negative results. 2) Publications containing rs-fMRI data were limited, which may have led to inadequate sample size. 3) The AES-SDM software allows only peak coordinates or statistical maps to be entered as original data. Thus, the meta-analysis included only rs-fMRI studies using ReHo as a physiologically meaningful indicator of localized functional connectivity. In addition, no abnormal brain region was shared by patients and unaffected relatives. This finding may partly impede a complete understanding of the association between brain abnormalities and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Therefore, more studies should be conducted on structure, activity, and function in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDespite these limitations, the present meta-analysis revealed that schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives had extensive abnormal localized connectivity in cerebrum, especially in superior temporal gyrus, which were the potential diagnostic markers and expounded the pathophysiological hypothesis for the disorder. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5317331,"text_md5":"66e11c75bfb6acdc201fd50fd1eb0866","field_positions":{"authors":[0,92],"journal":[93,117],"publication_year":[119,123],"title":[134,310],"keywords":[324,461],"abstract":[474,1911],"body":[1920,20017]},"batch":2,"pmid":28243099,"doi":"10.2147\/NDT.S126678","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5317331","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5317331"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5317331\">5317331<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5317331  Abnormalities of localized connectivity in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives: a meta-analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies"}
{"text":"Kocar, Thomas Derya and M\u00fcller, Hans-Peter and Kassubek, Jan\nTher Adv Neurol Disord, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nDifferential functional connectivity in thalamic and dopaminergic pathways in restless legs syndrome: a meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nnetworks\nrestless legs syndrome\nresting state\nthalamus\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Objective: \n  \nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder with alterations in somatosensory processing in association with a dysfunctional cerebral network, involving the basal ganglia, limbic network, and sensorimotor pathways. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool to provide   in vivo   insight into functional processing and as such is of special interest in RLS considering the widespread pattern of networks involved in this disorder. In this meta-analysis of resting state functional MRI studies, we analyzed the preponderance of functional connectivity changes associated with RLS and discussed possible links to sensorimotor dysfunction and somatosensory processing. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nA systematic research using the online library PubMed was conducted and a total of seven studies passed the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis. The results of these studies were merged and a statistical probability map was generated that indicated the likelihood of functional connectivity changes within the combined cohort, both for increased and decreased connectivity. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nThe meta-analysis demonstrated decreased functional connectivity within the dopaminergic network in participants with RLS compared with healthy controls, including the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. Increased functional connectivity was observed bilaterally in the thalamus, including its ventral lateral, ventral anterior, and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, and the pulvinar. \n\n\n## Discussion: \n  \nSensorimotor dysfunction in RLS seems to be reflected by decreased functional connectivity within the dopaminergic pathways. Network extension in the thalamus can be regarded as an adaptation to somatosensory dysfunction in RLS. This differential functional connectivity pattern extends prior findings on cerebral somatosensory processing in RLS and offers an explanation for the efficacy of dopaminergic treatment. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRestless legs syndrome (RLS, Willis\u2013Ekbom disease) is a common neurological movement and sleep disorder, with a prevalence of up to 5% in the adult general population.  RLS is defined by clinical diagnostic criteria, that is, the urge to move the legs, predominantly during episodes of rest and in the evening, which is accompanied by discomforting sensations and alleviated by moving the legs.  Idiopathic RLS is often described as a sensorimotor disorder, given that both sensory and motor circuits and their interplay in sensorimotor integration are under descending control from monoaminergic clusters in the brain.  Altered dopaminergic modulation of neuronal excitability is generally thought to be one main underlying pathophysiological mechanism of RLS.  Neuroimaging studies in RLS indicate a disease-specific dysfunctional cerebral network, involving the basal ganglia, the limbic network, and the sensorimotor system.  Abnormal iron metabolism in the brain is believed to cause dopaminergic dysfunction in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways, which in turn could cause the sensorimotor network dysfunction.  At network level, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABA-mediated, and adenosinergic dysfunctions are considered to be associated with subsequent cortical hyperexcitability or disinhibition. Thus, RLS might be regarded as a multitransmitter neurochemical disorder, globally with enhanced excitability and decreased inhibition.  In this context, electrophysiological data suggest that in RLS, both cortical, subcortical, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve generators are involved in the network disorder, resulting in an enhanced excitability and\/or decreased inhibition. \n\nResting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a powerful tool to provide   in vivo   insight into functional processing in a task-free condition, beyond the structural level.  Prior rs-fMRI studies indicated that patients with RLS may have deficits in controlling and managing sensory information, supporting the hypothesis that RLS could be a disorder of somatosensory processing.  Given the broad array of networks that exhibit functional connectivity changes in RLS, we asked where the preponderance of changes is located and if it is specifically associated with somatosensory processing. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis including all available data on idiopathic RLS and rs-fMRI. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategy and study selection \n  \nThe literature review and study inclusion process was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.  In a systematic search conducted in February 2020, data were collected from the online library PubMed ( ). The search queries and keywords were (a) \u201cresting state\u201d AND \u201crestless legs\u201d, (b) \u201cresting state\u201d AND \u201cRLS\u201d, (c) \u201cresting-state\u201d AND \u201cRLS\u201d, and (d) \u201cresting-state\u201d AND \u201crestless legs\u201d. All studies up until February 2020 were included. In total, this search yielded 15 results. These 15 studies were probed for the following criteria: the studies had to be published in the English language in peer-reviewed journals; only human studies that used rs-fMRI including a whole-brain analysis were included; both participants with RLS and a control group of similar size like the RLS group, matched for age and gender, had to be present; only studies were included for which it was stated that the participants met diagnostic criteria according to common diagnostic guidelines for RLS;  only studies on idiopathic RLS were included. Patients had to be either drug-na\u00efve or asked to stop medication before the trial, that is, cessation of medication had to be performed prior to the study for at least 3-fold its biological half-life. From the 15 studies in question, only 8 conducted rs-fMRI with either seed-based or independent component analysis, and only these studies were included since other methods were not considered comparable. From these eight studies, one was excluded due to secondary RLS as the condition under investigation, as opposed to idiopathic RLS. In one study, both treated and drug-na\u00efve participants were present.  Here, only the analyses of the drug-na\u00efve subjects were included. The references in each of the 15 studies were carefully studied for further candidate studies, but this cross-reference search did not yield additional inclusions. In total, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For a summary of the literature review and study inclusion process, see  . \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram depicting the literature review, exclusion and inclusion process. \n  \nThis analysis is a meta-analysis without acquisition of new data. All contributing studies reported that they were conducted in human subjects according to the current World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Imaging data processing \n  \nThe seven included studies were screened for significant differences in functional connectivity between participants with idiopathic RLS and healthy controls.  For each study, the number of contributing subjects was noted for later statistical weighting to prevent bias from small studies. Only clusters that were significant after correction for multiple comparisons (at least   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) were included. In two studies,  no correction for multiple comparisons was reported; here, all clusters that passed an uncorrected significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 were included, which we considered equivalent. Clusters had to be reported in a common stereotaxic space, that is, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates (  n  \u2009=\u20097). From each study, all significant clusters were extracted including cluster size, peak MNI coordinates, and associated   t  -value (or related parameters). Each cluster was then reshaped to a spherical volume around the peak coordinate for the subsequent statistical analysis resulting in a total of 60 clusters for the inclusion into the further analysis. \n\nThe Tensor Imaging and Fiber Tracking (TIFT) software package was used for statistical analyses, as described in a previous meta-analysis with diffusion-weighted MRI data.  The statistical process was transferred to the present rs-fMRI data set: each of the 60 coordinates was placed as Gaussian shaped result-spheres with its corresponding size, weighted with the square-root of contributing subjects of the respective study. The signal from overlaying clusters was added, leading to high signal strength in areas in which several clusters converged. In order to spatially homogenize the input information, the resulting 3-D data set was spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of full-width-at-half-maximum size of 18\u2009mm. This filter size was regarded as a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, as it allowed eliminating small isolated result clusters, while collimating neighboring clusters from different studies. In order to account for this lenient smoothing, we decided to discard voxels with signal strength of less than half of the global maximum. Then, a standard clustering procedure was applied; in order to discard false-positive results, clusters below a cluster size threshold of 512 voxels (mm\u00b3) were excluded.  The entire procedure was done separately for clusters with increased and decreased functional connectivity, respectively. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Qualitative synthesis \n  \nEach of the studies included in the meta-analysis used a seed-based approach to resting state fMRI data analysis. Common seeds were the default mode network,  the thalamus,  the putamen,  or a combination of several networks.  While the integration of these results may seem challenging, a rather coherent picture emerged from the synthesis. Among the areas most affected by functional connectivity changes were the basal ganglia, the frontal lobe, and limbic structures. Each of the following areas was reported in at least two of the analyzed studies: Increased functional connectivity was most prominent in the thalamus, but also found in parahippocampal gyrus and the superior parietal lobe. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in the basal ganglia (most notably the caudate nucleus and the putamen), the cingulate and paracingulate gyrus, the orbito-frontal cortex, as well as the medial and superior frontal gyrus. For a detailed list of the studies and their respective results, see  . \n  \nStudies included in the meta-analysis, ordered by time of publication. \n      \n\n### Quantitative synthesis \n  \nIn total, six significant clusters emerged from the analysis. The majority of functional connectivity changes was located in the thalamus and in areas belonging to the dopaminergic pathways, the former showing increased and the latter showing decreased connectivity ( ). Increased functional connectivity in the thalamus involved the ventral lateral, ventral anterior, and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the right hemisphere and the pulvinar in the left hemisphere. Decreased functional connectivity in the dopaminergic pathways was observed bilaterally in the putamen and the nucleus accumbens, the left caudate head, and the left medial frontal gyrus. In addition to these findings, decreased functional connectivity was observed in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the precuneus.

Within the dopaminergic system, all of the major components, that is, nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways, were shown to be altered. \n\nPrevious rs-fMRI studies in RLS reported connectivity changes in brain regions related to the thalamus, indicating that the thalamic regions may be associated with altered sensory monitoring and perception processing in RLS.  The thalamus was previously observed to show functional connectivity changes within its associated sensory thalamic circuits.  In addition, diurnal functional connectivity changes in the thalamus were reported, from hyperconnectivity in the morning to hypoconnectivity in the evening, reflecting the circadian presentation of RLS symptomatology.  With respect to these pathoanatomical concepts, increased functional connectivity in the current meta-analysis was indeed observed bilaterally in the thalamus, including its anterior, ventral lateral, ventral anterior, and ventral posterior lateral nuclei in the left hemisphere and the pulvinar in the right hemisphere. These results are in general accordance with prior interpretations of rs-fMRI studies that RLS patients may have deficits in controlling and managing sensory information. \n\nThe finding of decreased functional connectivity within the dopaminergic system adds new aspects to this concept of RLS-associated alterations of somatosensory processing. Our results are supported by recent studies that emphasized the importance of the putamen in the pathophysiology of RLS. In a morphometric analysis of subcortical gray matter, Li and colleagues found abnormalities in the putamen that correlated with disease duration of RLS.  In addition, diurnal changes that reflect circadian characteristics of RLS were not only reported to occur in the thalamus, but also in the striatum.  Interestingly, our meta-analytic findings were not confined to the nigrostriatal pathway, but also included functional connectivity alterations in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. This constellation can be regarded as a representation of a distributed dysfunction of dopamine metabolism in association with RLS as it was previously shown by positron emission tomography analyses, which indicated dysfunction not only the nigrostriatal but also mesolimbic pathways.  The broad spectrum of RLS symptomatology could relate to each of these pathways, that is, motor symptoms to the nigrostriatal pathway and discomfort and pain to the mesolimbic\/limbic system.  A recent rs-fMRI study demonstrated specific effects of dopaminergic treatment in the mesocortical pathways: when compared with drug-na\u00efve RLS patients, dopamine intake increased functional connectivity in the mesocortical pathway.  It is possible that this increase might compensate for otherwise insufficient mesocortical functional connectivity, offering an explanation for its therapeutic effect. In general, this finding is not at odds with pathophysiological concepts of RLS as a hyperdopaminergic state,  given that RLS seems to constitute a condition with cerebral dopamine dysfunction. \n\nCerebral networks involved in pain bear a striking resemblance to the functional connectivity changes observed in this meta-analysis. Sensory input from the spinal cord to both thalamic and limbic structures is considered to convey affective information related to nociceptive sensations. Together with the sensory information from thalamocortical pathways, these pathways converge in the anterior cingulate, where the information is integrated.  Given that pain is among the most commonly reported symptoms of RLS, both altered thalamic functional connectivity and decreased connectivity in the limbic system, specifically the anterior cingulate gyrus, may reflect involvement of the nociceptive system in RLS symptomatology.  The multiple neurotransmission dysfunction may also constitute a link between RLS and other chronic pain disorders. \n\nThe current meta-analysis was not without limitations. A relatively low number of seven studies (with a total of 134 participants with RLS) that met the inclusion criteria could be included, indicating a limited application of the rs-fMRI approach to RLS yet. In general, the number of advanced MRI studies in this common disorder is rather limited, perhaps due to the patients\u2019 restlessness and inability to lie down in the scanner without moving. All of the studies included in this meta-analysis followed a seed-based approach to rs-fMRI; this, however, might have biased the analysis as it is possible that functional connectivity changes within networks that are not covered by a specific seed are not registered. As a further limitation, no weighting and no correlation analyses were performed between regional connectivity strength and measures of disease severity (e.g. international RLS rating scale), respectively, given that the mean scores were almost identical in the contributing studies with relatively high standard deviations ( ). The functional connectivity changes observed in association with RLS might be attributed to structural abnormalities. A well-accepted hypothesis is that abnormal iron metabolism in the putamen is associated with dopaminergic and sensorimotor dysfunction in RLS.  Decreased functional connectivity within the dopaminergic pathways as found in this meta-analysis could be interpreted as a result of these deficits. In addition, macro- and microstructural abnormalities in the spinothalamic fibers, the brainstem, the midbrain, and the thalamus are considered to provoke functional and metabolic changes within the sensorimotor system and specifically the thalamus.  Increased functional connectivity in the thalamus could thus be regarded as an adaptive consequence to compensate for these structural deficits.  Given that both the thalamus and the dopaminergic pathways are interwoven within the sensorimotor system, such a combination of these pathoanatomical concepts could explain somatosensory processing deficits and sensorimotor dysfunction in RLS. A straightforward integration of our results in current clinical neurophysiology data in RLS is possible; neurophysiological studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reported altered motor cortex excitability and dysfunctional sensorimotor integration in RLS.  In addition, RLS patients exhibited an impairment of the long-term depression-like mechanisms induced by inhibitory repetitive TMS compared with healthy subjects, indicating abnormal cortical plasticity.  Modification of these networks   via   repetitive TMS-mediated modulation of cortical excitability within the sensorimotor network has shown to alleviate the sensorimotor symptoms in RLS.  These findings support the abnormal somatosensory processing function and the altered functional connectivity observed in RLS. \n\nHowever, it remains yet unresolved how the functional and structural brain abnormalities in RLS relate to each other. As a perspective, a future longitudinal study with rs-fMRI, perhaps together with structural imaging modalities like diffusion tensor imaging, might demonstrate how these abnormalities develop over time and how they relate to the course of symptom severity. An \u2018ideal\u2019 candidate study should monitor iron content within the brain, micro- and macrostructural changes, as well as rs-fMRI in newly diagnosed RLS over an interval of several years and correlate the MRI data with clinical and neuropsychological scores. In addition, a longitudinal observation of the effects of pharmaceutical treatment could help explain efficacy and long-term side effects, such as augmentation. This way it might be possible to further unravel the relationship between structural, functional, and clinical findings in RLS. \n\nIn conclusion, the current meta-analysis of rs-MRI data demonstrated differential functional connectivity in thalamic and dopaminergic pathways in participants with RLS compared with controls, with decreased connectivity in the dopaminergic system and increased connectivity in the thalamus. Increased functional connectivity in the thalamus can be interpreted as network extension, adaptive to somatosensory dysfunction. Decreased functional connectivity in the dopaminergic system could reflect sensorimotor dysfunction. The broad affection of the dopaminergic system (nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways) may partially explain RLS symptomatology, including discomfort, sleep, and motor symptoms. The present rs-fMRI meta-analysis supports the hypothesis of somatosensory processing deficits in RLS and contributes to the framework around RLS pathophysiology and the efficacy of dopaminergic treatment. In highlighting the importance of sensorimotor integration in RLS, our data also support other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments,  including non-invasive neuromodulation.  By this contribution to the understanding of the pathophysiology, this meta-analysis might assist in the development of new treatment options in RLS that will specifically target the dysfunction of somatosensory processing. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7412904,"text_md5":"39f90f8f03abc5430c9b35eb6aaa8e2a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,83],"publication_year":[85,89],"title":[100,217],"keywords":[231,319],"abstract":[332,2325],"body":[2334,22010]},"batch":2,"pmid":32821291,"doi":"10.1177\/1756286420941670","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7412904","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7412904"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7412904\">7412904<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7412904  Differential functional connectivity in thalamic and dopaminergic pathways in restless legs syndrome: a meta-analysis"}
{"text":"LaCroix, Arianna N. and James, Eltonnelle and Rogalsky, Corianne\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nNeural Resources Supporting Language Production vs. Comprehension in Chronic Post-stroke Aphasia: A Meta-Analysis Using Activation Likelihood Estimates\n\n# Keywords\n\nspeech\nlanguage\nproduction\ncomprehension\naphasia\nmeta-analysis\nfMRI\nstroke\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIn post-stroke aphasia, language tasks recruit a combination of residual regions within the canonical language network, as well as regions outside of it in the left and right hemispheres. However, there is a lack of consensus as to how the neural resources engaged by language production and comprehension following a left hemisphere stroke differ from one another and from controls. The present meta-analysis used activation likelihood estimates to aggregate across 44 published fMRI and PET studies to characterize the functional reorganization patterns for expressive and receptive language processes in persons with chronic post-stroke aphasia (PWA). Our results in part replicate previous meta-analyses: we find that PWA activate residual regions within the left lateralized language network, regardless of task. Our results extend this work to show differential recruitment of the left and right hemispheres during language production and comprehension in PWA. First, we find that PWA engage left perilesional regions during language comprehension, and that the extent of this activation is likely driven by stimulus type and domain-general cognitive resources needed for task completion. In contrast to comprehension, language production was associated with activation of the right frontal and temporal cortices. Further analyses linked right hemisphere regions involved in motor speech planning for language production with successful naming in PWA, while unsuccessful naming was associated with the engagement of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a region often implicated in domain-general cognitive processes. While the within-group findings indicate that the engagement of the right hemisphere during language tasks in post-stroke aphasia differs for expressive vs. receptive tasks, the overall lack of major between-group differences between PWA and controls implies that PWA rely on similar cognitive-linguistic resources for language as controls. However, more studies are needed that report coordinates for PWA and controls completing the same tasks in order for future meta-analyses to characterize how aphasia affects the neural resources engaged during language, particularly for specific tasks and as a function of behavioral performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAphasia is an acquired communication disorder in which individuals have difficulty with the production and\/or comprehension of language, typically following a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery from aphasia is highly variable but largely dependent on stroke specific characteristics such as lesion size and location (particularly the extent of white matter involvement; Turkeltaub,  ). Each of these characteristics also impacts the neural resources which support language functions post-stroke. For example, large left hemisphere lesions are generally associated with increased right hemisphere activation compared to smaller, more focal left hemisphere lesions (Karbe et al.,  ; Cao et al.,  ; Blasi et al.,  ; Heiss and Thiel,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ). However, focal damage can also lead to widespread disruptions of functionally and\/or anatomically connected brain regions that support language; for example by disrupting critical white matter tracts (Price et al.,  ; Martin et al.,  ; Barwood et al.,  ; Papoutsi et al.,  ; Basilakos et al.,  ; Forkel et al.,  ; Xing et al.,  ,  ). Both lesion size and location have been associated with behavioral outcomes including overall aphasia severity and specific language abilities (e.g., auditory comprehension, verbal expression; Plowman et al.,  ; Forkel et al.,  ; Marebwa et al.,  ; Xing et al.,  ,  ; Thye and Mirman,  ; Benghanem et al.,  ; Turkeltaub,  ; Wilson and Schneck,  ). Additionally, the exact neural resources engaged during language tasks in persons with aphasia (PWA) is known to be influenced by task demands, and dependent upon the location of the lesion that resulted in language impairments (Blank et al.,  ; Cherney and Small,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ). \n\nLanguage recovery in post-stroke aphasia is likely driven by a combination of functional reorganization and activation of residual regions within the canonical language network . Functional reorganization involves recruitment of brain regions outside of the canonical language network to varying degrees; these can include left perilesional regions , bilateral cognitive networks, and\/or right hemisphere homologs of the left lateralized portions of the canonical language network. While left perilesional regions have consistently been shown to support residual language functions (e.g., Price and Crinion,  ; Crinion et al.,  ; Warren et al.,  ; Fridriksson et al.,  ; Tyler et al.,  ; Allendorfer et al.,  ; Robson et al.,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ), the role of the right hemisphere in language recovery is less clear, particularly since right hemisphere activation has been associated with both better (Karbe et al.,  ; Cao et al.,  ; Musso et al.,  ; Blasi et al.,  ; Heiss and Thiel,  ; Harnish et al.,  ; Raboyeau et al.,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Heath et al.,  ; Robson et al.,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ) and poorer language outcomes (Richter et al.,  ; Postman-Caucheteux et al.,  ; Naeser et al.,  ). Small sample sizes and other inconsistencies across studies (e.g., variable tasks and number of trials, differences in thresholding and analysis approaches) likely have contributed to these seemingly mixed results, leaving many unanswered questions regarding neural reorganization and language recovery in aphasia. \n\nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a meta-analysis technique that can be used to overcome the limitations of individual experiments. ALE can identify brain regions which are consistently activated across all imaging studies of interest. The algorithm then determines whether this convergence is higher than what would be expected from a spatially random distribution (Eickhoff et al.,  ). In their 2011 ALE meta-analysis of activation in PWA during any type of language task, Turkeltaub and colleagues found PWA activate a combination of spared regions within the canonical language network, left perilesional regions, and right hemisphere homologs during language (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). A secondary analysis comparing PWA with and without lesions to the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) revealed those with lesions to the left IFG activate the right IFG more during language tasks than those with a lesion sparing the left IFG. These results provide some evidence that anatomically and\/or functionally homologous regions may be engaged to support language through compensatory processes in PWA. For example, the right inferior frontal gyrus may be more engaged during language tasks when the left inferior frontal gyrus is lesioned, due to shared domain-general cognitive functions (Ries et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, Turkeltaub et al.'s ( ) meta-analysis almost exclusively included production tasks (75%, 9\/12 studies; e.g., picture naming, verb generation) and did not consider possible differences in functional reorganization for production vs. comprehension. Thus, this approach likely missed important insights into the relative contributions of perilesional vs. right hemisphere engagement for language processing post-stroke; particularly since expressive and receptive language processes are typically supported by distinct (but interacting) neural resources that have different lateralization patterns. For instance, language production is associated with a left lateralized dorsal stream in frontal and parietal cortices, while language comprehension is generally supported by bilateral ventral streams in temporal and parietal regions (Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ). It is therefore likely that the left and right hemispheres are recruited differently for expressive and receptive language following a left hemisphere stroke. Thus, the seemingly mixed results across individual studies may actually represent separate functional reorganization patterns for productive vs. receptive language following a left hemisphere stroke. For example, damage to the left dorsal stream may result in activation of residual left hemisphere tissue during language production tasks (Fridriksson et al.,  ; Allendorfer et al.,  ), while other studies show recruitment of their right hemisphere homologs (Karbe et al.,  ; Cao et al.,  ; Harnish et al.,  ; Raboyeau et al.,  ; Heath et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ). For the more bilateral ventral stream, some previous work in PWA suggests increased right ventral stream activation during language comprehension tasks (Crinion and Price,  ; Crinion et al.,  ), whereas other studies have found activation predominately within the perilesional tissue of the left ventral stream, or even activation of domain-general regions in right frontal cortex (Warren et al.,  ; Tyler et al.,  ; Robson et al.,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ). Thus, there is a need to conduct meta-analyses investigating language production and comprehension studies separately in order to better understand how functional reorganization may differ for expressive vs. receptive language abilities, particularly regarding perilesional vs. right hemisphere involvement. \n\nSeveral more recent reviews have also taken critical steps toward summarizing the literature related to the neural resources supporting language functions following a left hemisphere stroke (Hartwigsen and Saur,  ; Stefaniak et al.,  ; Turkeltaub,  ; Wilson and Schneck,  ). Two of these papers primarily focus on providing comprehensive reviews of theories related to language recovery from post-stroke aphasia (Stefaniak et al.,  ; Turkeltaub,  ), and also how different person- and stroke-specific characteristics impact language recovery (Turkeltaub,  ). Hartwigsen and Saur's ( ) review primarily focuses on longitudinal studies of language recovery and how neurostimulation may impact language recovery in the acute and sub-acute recovery stages. In a partial extension of this work, Wilson and Schneck ( ) conducted a systematic review in which they critically appraised the strength of the literature regarding the neural resources supporting language in the chronic stage of aphasia recovery. Wilson and Schneck ( ) also sought to identify brain regions that were associated with increased or decreased activation for PWA during language tasks. While their review and analysis is incredibly informative, it included multiple methods for reporting findings (i.e., coordinates, figures, text descriptions were all included), thus, the spatial resolution of their findings of activation (or deactivation) is somewhat limited. Furthermore, activation and deactivations were not discussed in terms of differences between expressive and receptive language processes (Wilson and Schneck,  ). Therefore, questions remain regarding the neural resources supporting language production vs. comprehension in post-stroke aphasia. \n\nComparing the neural resources which are engaged by language production and comprehension may be helpful in characterizing the mechanisms which drive right hemisphere engagement during language in post-stroke aphasia. A direct comparison of language production and comprehension tasks in post-stroke aphasia is warranted since several individual studies indicate that production and comprehension recruit partially distinct neural resources in PWA (L\u00e9ger et al.,  ; Cherney and Small,  ; Eaton et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Haldin et al.,  ). This direct comparison can also help elucidate whether the right hemisphere is engaged in language in PWA due to speech and language-specific processes or more domain-general cognitive processes, which are known to recruit similar, yet distinct neural resources as language (e.g., Fedorenko et al.,  ). For example, voxels in the right hemisphere which are activated by production and also more significantly activated for production than comprehension, may be performing similar computations as regions within the left dorsal stream, including those involved in motor speech planning for language. Alternatively, finding right hemisphere regions that are equally activated by both production and comprehension, may instead suggest that the right hemisphere is engaged by language through domain-general processes related to attention, executive control, or alertness, or perhaps through language resources shared by production and comprehension tasks (e.g., phonological processes, decision-making). \n\nThe present meta-analysis expands upon previous reviews by using activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ), which provides greater spatial resolution than region of interest approaches, to separately investigate the neural resources engaged by language production vs. comprehension in persons with chronic aphasia. This direct comparison between production and comprehension is now sufficiently powered (Eickhoff et al.,  ) due to the substantial increase in published fMRI\/PET studies over the last 10 years. We focus on chronic aphasia here as longitudinal studies of language recovery in aphasia indicate that in the acute stage (<6 months post-stroke), there is a gradual transition from the initial recruitment of right hemisphere resources to left perilesional regions as language recovers (Saur et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ; Hartwigsen and Saur,  ). The present meta-analysis sought to determine what neural resources are consistently engaged across studies by language production and\/or comprehension in PWA, and how this compares to controls. We additionally aimed to explore whether the neural resources engaged by language differ for specific tasks (e.g., picture naming, word generation) in PWA and controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nThis meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework (Moher et al.,  ). A PRISMA flow diagram for the literature search is documented in  . The search criteria for each database are reported in  . PubMed and Google Scholar were periodically searched between August 2015 and December 2020 to locate peer-reviewed articles published prior to December 2020 that used fMRI or PET to measure brain activations to speech and language stimuli in PWA. The PubMed search yielded a total of 759 articles. For Google Scholar, we extracted the first 150 citations for each search criteria, which resulted in 1,500 citations (150 citations x 10 search criteria). The combined lists resulted in 1,944 articles after duplicates were removed. The titles and abstracts of these 1,944 articles were reviewed to determine if they met the following criteria: (1) publication was written in English, (2) adult participants with a history of stroke, and (3) use of fMRI or PET methodologies. We identified 173 citations meeting these three criteria and extracted the full-text articles for further review. Of the 173 citations meeting our first three criteria, 137 were excluded for the reasons reported in   and  . This left 36 articles which met our additional inclusion criteria: (4) studies reported peak coordinates from a whole-brain analysis, (5) compared language production or comprehension tasks to a non-speech baseline (e.g., rest, noise, tones, visual stimuli), (6) in persons with chronic aphasia (>6 months post-stroke). In addition, we manually searched Wilson and Schneck's ( ) recent systematic review and meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies in post-stroke aphasia and identified an additional eight articles meeting our inclusion criteria . \n  \nThe PRISMA flow diagram adapted for our literature search.  The 44 articles resulted in 49 tasks as five papers included both production and comprehension tasks. This resulted in 29 production and 21 comprehension tasks being included in the analyses. \n    \nSearch terms for each database. \n  \nOur combined searches resulted in a total of 44 articles being included in the meta-analysis ( ). From these 44 articles, we extracted 50 tasks, 29 production (207 PWA and 194 control subjects) and 21 comprehension tasks (228 PWA and 207 control subjects) for analysis; five articles included both production and comprehension tasks. Of these 50 tasks, 33 tasks, 16 production (164 PWA and 194 control subjects) and 17 comprehension (205 PWA and 207 control subjects), included PWA and control participants completing the same task in the same study; these tasks were analyzed separately to compare activations between the two groups. Since not all studies included control data, each section within the results is structured to first present ALEs that included all PWA data, followed by ALEs for the control participants, and lastly group comparisons using the subset of data that included both PWA and controls in the same study completing the same task. Production tasks were overt or covert and included picture naming, word generation (noun, verb), repetition (syllable, word), and spontaneous language production. Comprehension tasks could be auditory or visual and included listening to sentences, semantic decision, reading (single words, pseudowords), and rhyming tasks. \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimate Meta-Analysis \n  \nActivation likelihood estimates (ALEs), a coordinate-based meta-analysis method, were calculated for each single condition and contrast of interest using GingerALE Version 3.0.2 (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ). All MNI coordinates were transformed into Talairach space using GingerALE's stereotaxic coordinate converter. Talairach coordinates were then combined to create 3D maps depicting the likelihood of activation within each voxel in a MRI template. Significant areas were identified depending on whether the identified area was more likely to occur in comparison to spatially random distributions. Number of subjects in each study was input into the analysis and used to calculate the amount of blurring and uncertainty around the coordinates, which is accounted for in the FWHM of the Gaussian curve. It is also recommended that ALEs include at least 8\u201317 studies to avoid clusters that are primarily driven by one study (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Single condition analyses were thresholded using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at   p   = 0.05 (10,000 permutations) with a cluster forming threshold of   p   < 0.001 (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The following single condition analyses were computed separately for PWA and controls: a combined analysis for language production and comprehension, language production only, and language comprehension only. We additionally computed separate sub-analyses for PWA and controls using coordinates associated with tasks frequently used to measure language abilities in PWA: picture naming, auditory sentence listening, semantic decisions, and word generation (Wilson and Schneck,  ). \n\nContrast analyses were computed to identify common and distinct neural resources involved in language production and comprehension within PWA and controls (within-subject analyses). Contrast analyses were also used to conduct between-group comparisons for the combined language production and comprehension, language production only, language comprehension only, and four task-specific analyses (picture naming, auditory sentence listening, semantic decisions, and word generation). Contrast analyses use ALE maps thresholded for multiple comparisons, therefore the contrast threshold was set to uncorrected   p   = 0.05 (10,000 permutations) with a 200 mm  minimum volume (Eickhoff et al.,  ). ALE statistical maps were rendered onto the ch2.nii template brain using MRIcron (Rorden and Brett,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neural Resources Engaged by Language \n  \nWe first computed an ALE which combined language production and comprehension in a single analysis to identify neural resources which are generally engaged by language in PWA and controls, regardless of task. \n\n#### All PWA \n  \nThe combined ALE included all 50 tasks (29 production, 21 comprehension) and identified five significant clusters for PWA in bilateral fronto-temporal regions. Peak activations within the temporal lobe included the right posterior superior temporal gyrus and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. In the frontal lobe, peak activations were in the left superior and middle frontal gyri, as well as the right anterior insula (largest cluster). These peak activations additionally extended into the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, left medial frontal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, left posterior insula, and right middle and precentral gyri (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). We also conducted this analysis using the 33 tasks that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in  . \n  \nAnatomical locations of peak coordinates and cluster size for each single condition and contrast ALE in PWA. \n  \n The x, y, z coordinates are in Talairach space and refer to the peak voxel activated in each cluster. All single condition ALEs are thresholded at p < 0.001 corrected and contrast ALEs at p = 0.05 uncorrected. Asterisks indicate anatomical location of peak voxel  . \n    \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the combined production and comprehension ALEs in   (A)   PWA (  p   < 0.001 corrected),   (B)   PWA and controls (  p   < 0.001 corrected), and   (C)   PWA vs. controls (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected).   (B,C)   only include data from tasks which included both PWA and control data. Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \n\n#### Controls \n  \nThe combined language production and comprehension ALE for controls included 33 tasks (16 production, 17 comprehension). This ALE identified seven significant clusters in controls. The largest cluster's peak was in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Subsequent peaks were identified in the left superior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (two peaks), and left superior parietal lobule (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### PWA vs. Controls \n  \nThe ALE conjunction analysis using the 33 tasks which included PWA and control data revealed nine significant clusters activated in PWA and controls. Six clusters were in the left hemisphere with the largest peak being in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis). Smaller activations were found in the left superior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, and left posterior superior temporal gyrus (three peaks). The remaining three peaks were in the right hemisphere and included the right medial frontal gyrus, right anterior insula, and right posterior middle temporal gyrus. As expected, the contrast analysis revealed controls activate the canonical language network more than PWA (likely at least in part due to PWA having lesions in these left perisylvian areas). The largest peak activation for controls compared to PWA was found in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), with smaller activations being identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), left superior parietal lobule, left anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, and right anterior superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, PWA, compared to controls, only activated the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) more during all language tasks (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ;  ). \n  \nAnatomical locations of peak coordinates and cluster size for each contrast ALE comparing PWA and controls. \n  \n The x, y, z coordinates are in Talairach space and refer to the peak voxel activated in each cluster. All contrast ALEs are thresholded at p = 0.05 uncorrected. Asterisks indicate anatomical location of peak voxel  . \n  \n\n\n### Neural Resources Engaged by Language Production \n  \n#### All PWA \n  \nThe language production ALE included all 29 production tasks with aphasia data. We also conducted this analysis using the 16 production tasks that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in  . The ALE with all 29 production tasks identified five significant clusters in PWA. The largest peak was in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis). Smaller peaks were identified in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. These peak activations extended into the right precentral gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, and right anterior insula (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n  \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the language production ALEs in   (A)   PWA (  p   < 0.001 corrected),   (B)   PWA and controls (  p   < 0.001 corrected), and   (C)   PWA vs. controls (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected).   (B,C)   only include data from tasks which included both PWA and control data. Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \nWe additionally decided to compute   post-hoc   ALE analyses for each aphasia subtype. However, due to a paucity of aphasia type-specific activations reported in literature,   post-hoc   ALEs were only computed for the two most frequent aphasia types for which data was reported: Broca's aphasia (7 studies with 15 PWA) and Wernicke's aphasia (3 studies with 8 PWA). However, these ALEs should be interpreted with caution due to having fewer than eight studies included. The findings from both the Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia ALEs align with the production results from the larger PWA sample. The Broca's aphasia ALE identified four significant clusters with peaks in the right precentral gyrus (largest peak), right middle frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus. The Wernicke's aphasia ALE identified three significant clusters with peaks in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis; largest), right middle temporal gyrus, and left caudate ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### Controls \n  \nSixteen production tasks included control data. Six clusters were significantly activated by controls during language production. The control group's largest peak was in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Additional peaks were identified in the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right insula, and right superior temporal gyrus (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### PWA vs. Controls \n  \nSixteen production studies included PWA and controls completing the same task. Three significant clusters were activated by both PWA and controls during language production: peak activations were identified in the left middle frontal gyrus (largest cluster), right posterior superior temporal gyrus, and right anterior insula. PWA did not significantly activate any regions more than controls during language production. However, the analysis identified seven clusters significantly more active in controls than PWA: the largest cluster was in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), and smaller clusters were identified in the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral posterior middle temporal gyri, right anterior superior temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis;   p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ;  ). It was not possible to compare persons with Broca's aphasia or persons with Wernicke's aphasia to controls completing the same task as there were only two studies for each aphasia diagnosis that also included control data for the same task. \n\n\n\n### Neural Resources Engaged by Language Comprehension \n  \n#### All PWA \n  \nThe language comprehension ALE included all 21 comprehension tasks with aphasia data. We also conducted this analysis using the 17 comprehension tasks that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in  . For all 21 comprehension tasks with aphasia data, the ALE identified nine significant clusters activated by PWA. Seven clusters were located in the left hemisphere with the largest peak being in the left middle frontal gyrus. Smaller peaks were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left posterior superior temporal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (one anterior and one posterior peak). Additional peak activations in the right hemisphere were found in the right middle frontal gyrus and right claustrum (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). We were not able to conduct   post-hoc   analyses for the aphasia subtypes as only two comprehension studies provided aphasia type-specific activation data (one for Broca's aphasia and one for Wernicke's aphasia). However,   post-hoc   analyses dividing the comprehension tasks by sensory modality (visual reading vs. auditory;  ) indicate that these findings are likely driven by the auditory comprehension tasks because the peak activations for the auditory comprehension tasks are quite similar to the PWA comprehension ALE ( ;  ), and the visual comprehension tasks did not elicit any significant activations at the threshold of   p   < 0.001 corrected. \n  \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the language comprehension ALEs in   (A)   PWA (  p   < 0.001 corrected),   (B)   PWA and controls (  p   < 0.001 corrected), and   (C)   PWA vs. controls (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected).   (B,C)   only include data from tasks which included both PWA and control data. Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \n\n#### Controls \n  \nSeventeen comprehension tasks included control data. The control comprehension ALE identified three clusters to be significantly activated during comprehension tasks. The largest cluster's peak was in the left middle frontal gyrus. Two additional peaks were identified in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) and left middle temporal gyrus (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### PWA vs. Controls \n  \nSeventeen comprehension tasks included PWA and control data. Four significant clusters were identified in both PWA and controls during language comprehension: three peaks were in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis, pars triangularis, pars orbitalis) with the largest cluster being in the left pars orbitalis. One additional peak, in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, was also observed to be activated by both PWA and controls during language comprehension. PWA significantly activated the left precentral gyrus more so than controls, while controls significantly activated the left middle frontal gyrus more than PWA (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Neural Resources Engaged by Language Production vs. Comprehension \n  \nTo further explore the contributions of the right hemisphere to language in post-stroke aphasia, we contrasted activation for language production and comprehension in PWA and controls. Here we report the ALE findings for production greater than comprehension, comprehension greater than production, and their conjunction. \n\n#### All PWA \n  \nThe ALE included data from all 29 production and 21 comprehension tasks (50 total) that reported aphasia data. The conjunction analysis identified seven significant clusters activated for language production and comprehension in PWA. These regions included the left middle, superior, and medial frontal gyri, left middle temporal gyrus (three clusters), and right anterior insula (largest cluster). The production greater than comprehension ALE in PWA identified the right precentral gyrus and right posterior superior temporal gyrus (largest cluster) to be more activated during language production than comprehension. For comprehension greater than production, PWA activated the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) the most, but also the left superior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus (two peaks), left anterior superior temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right putamen (lentiform nucleus;   p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ;  ). This same analysis was conducted using the 33 tasks (16 production, 17 comprehension) which included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in  . \n  \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the production > comprehension and comprehension > production ALEs in   (A)   PWA and   (B)   controls (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected). Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \n\n#### Controls \n  \nThe ALE included data from the 16 production and 17 comprehension tasks (33 total) that included control data. The conjunction analysis identified eight clusters activated by production and comprehension in controls. These clusters had peaks in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis; largest cluster), left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis; three peaks), left middle frontal gyrus (two peaks), left insula, and left middle temporal gyrus. The production greater than comprehension analysis identified five significant clusters. The largest cluster's peak was in the left medial frontal gyrus. Subsequent peaks were identified in the left middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), and right superior temporal gyrus (two peaks). Controls significantly activated two clusters for comprehension greater than production, the largest cluster was in the left middle temporal gyrus, and the other in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### The Effects of Task Type on the Neural Resources Engaged by Language \n  \n#### Picture Naming Tasks \n  \n##### All PWA \n  \nFifteen articles included a total of 106 PWA completing a picture naming task during scanning, for which an ALE was computed. We also conducted this analysis using the seven picture naming tasks that included both PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   Table 5   and depicted in   (  p   < 0.001 corrected). The ALE using all 15 picture naming tasks identified two significant clusters in PWA. The largest cluster's peak was in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus and extended into the right posterior middle temporal gyrus. The smaller cluster's peak was in the right precentral gyrus and extended into the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis;   p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n  \nAnatomical locations of peak coordinates and cluster size for each single task ALE in PWA. \n  \n The x, y, z coordinates are in Talairach space and refer to the peak voxel activated in each cluster.

Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \nTo explore activations related to naming task performance, we additionally conducted   post-hoc   ALEs to explore whether picture naming activation patterns differed for correctly and incorrectly named items. The ALE for correct responses included nine studies with 78 PWA. This ALE identified two significant clusters with peaks in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus; this finding aligns with the results of the main picture naming ALE ( ;  ;   p   < 0.001 corrected). The ALE for incorrectly named items should be interpreted with caution as it only included four studies with 12 PWA. Nonetheless, this ALE did identify activation of voxels in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) and right posterior middle temporal gyrus when items were incorrectly named ( ;  ;   p   < 0.001 corrected). No brain regions were significantly more active during correct naming than incorrect naming, but voxels in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) were found to be significantly more activated during incorrect naming than correct naming ( ;   p   = 0.05 uncorrected). \n  \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the ALEs associating picture naming activation with correct responses (red) and incorrect responses (blue;   p   < 0.001 corrected).

All contrast ALEs are thresholded at p = 0.05 uncorrected.

The conjunction ALE identified no significant clusters to be activated by both PWA and controls. PWA did not activate any brain region more than controls. However, the control greater than PWA ALE identified significant peaks in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis; largest cluster), left middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ). \n\n\n\n#### Word Generation Tasks \n  \n##### All PWA \n  \nEight articles included word generation tasks while scanning 62 PWA. The ALE for word generation resulted in five significant clusters with the largest peak being in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus, and smaller peaks in the right anterior insula, left posterior middle temporal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). We also conducted this analysis using just the six word generation tasks that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in   (  p   < 0.001 corrected). A   post-hoc   ALE of performance-related activations for word generation tasks could not be computed because no word generation study reported whether the coordinates were associated with correct or incorrect responses. \n\n\n##### Controls \n  \nSix articles included 63 control participants completing a word generation task during scanning. The control ALE identified four significant clusters with peaks in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis; largest cluster), left superior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis, pars orbitalis;   p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n##### PWA vs. Controls \n  \nSix articles included 43 PWA and 63 control participants completing the same word generation task. PWA and controls both activated the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) during word generation. PWA activated no brain regions more than controls. The control greater than PWA ALE identified four significant clusters including the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis; largest cluster), left middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis;   p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ). \n\n\n\n#### Semantic Decision Tasks \n  \n##### All PWA \n  \nEight articles included 91 PWA completing a semantic decision task during scanning. The ALE for semantic decisions identified two significant clusters; the largest cluster peaked in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the smaller peak was in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis;   p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). We also conducted this analysis using just the six semantic decision tasks that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis are reported in   and depicted in   (  p   < 0.001 corrected). A   post-hoc   ALE of performance-related activations for semantic decision tasks could not be computed because only two studies reported whether the coordinates were associated with correct or incorrect responses. \n  \nRepresentative sagittal slices for the semantic decision and auditory sentence listening ALEs in   (A)   PWA and   (B)   controls (  p   < 0.001 corrected). Sample size denotes the number of tasks included in the ALE. \n  \n\n##### Controls \n  \nSix articles included 70 control participants completing a semantic decision task during scanning. The control ALE identified no significant clusters (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ); because of this the contrast comparing PWA and controls could not be computed. \n\n\n\n#### Auditory Sentence Listening Tasks \n  \n##### All PWA \n  \nIn seven studies, 109 PWA listened to auditory sentences during scanning. The ALE for auditory sentence listening identified six clusters. Five clusters were located in the left hemisphere: the largest peak was in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), and smaller peaks were identified in the left middle frontal, superior frontal, posterior middle temporal, and anterior superior temporal gyri. The sixth peak was in the right claustrum (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). We also conducted this analysis using just the six sentence listening studies that included PWA and control data; the coordinates associated with this analysis for PWA are reported in   and depicted in   (  p   < 0.001 corrected). A   post-hoc   ALE of performance-related activations for auditory sentence listening tasks could not be computed because no study reported whether the coordinates were associated with correct or incorrect responses. \n\n\n##### Controls \n  \nSix articles included 91 control participants completing an auditory listening task during scanning. The control ALE identified one significant cluster in the left middle temporal gyrus (  p   < 0.001 corrected;  ;  ). \n\n\n##### PWA vs. Controls \n  \nSix articles included 108 PWA and 91 control participants completing the same auditory listening task during scanning. The ALE conjunction analysis identified PWA and controls to both activate the left middle temporal gyrus, however, neither PWA nor controls activated any brain region more than the other group (  p   = 0.05 uncorrected;  ). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present meta-analysis investigated how the left and right hemispheres are engaged during language production and comprehension in persons with chronic aphasia. We further sought to characterize how the neural resources engaged by language production and comprehension in PWA compares to what is observed in control subjects, as well as how the neural resources may differ based on task type. As expected, we found that PWA activated bilateral frontal and temporal cortices during language production and comprehension, similar to controls. However, unlike what has been previously reported in controls (e.g., LaCroix et al.,  ; Rodd et al.,  ), we find PWA to demonstrate greater overall activation of the right hemisphere for language production compared to comprehension, while the left hemisphere exhibited greater activation for comprehension than production. The implications of our findings regarding the functional reorganization of language in post-stroke aphasia, and how they may be related to the recruitment of domain-general cognitive resources are discussed below. \n\n### Neural Resources Engaged by Language in PWA vs. Controls \n  \nAs expected, our combined analysis investigating the neural resources engaged by language in PWA, across all production and comprehension tasks, identified a bilateral fronto-temporal network, coinciding with dual-stream models of speech processing (e.g., Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ). Specifically, PWA activated the canonical language network including the left middle frontal and temporal gyri, as well as left perilesional (e.g., tissue adjacent to the canonical language network) and right hemisphere regions (e.g., right insula). These findings align with a previous meta-analysis, in which PWA activated spared regions within the left lateralized language network, plus left perilesional and right hemisphere homologs including the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), right middle frontal gyrus, right insula, and right middle temporal gyrus (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). This same analysis in our control group revealed a similar bilateral fronto-temporal network, with additional activations being observed in the left superior and inferior parietal lobes. We further found that both PWA and controls activate left frontal regions (e.g., left inferior frontal gyrus) and bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri in response to all language tasks; this activation pattern was expected based on the dual stream models. In addition, PWA and controls both engaged bilateral regions implicated in multiple cognitive-linguistic functions, including the bilateral superior and medial frontal gyri and insula, across all language tasks. \n\nWhile the current and previous meta-analyses cannot fully account for behavioral performance, previous work associates left hemisphere activation (see Wilson and Schneck,   for a review), and to a lesser extent, activation of the right middle temporal gyrus with better language outcomes in PWA (Price and Crinion,  ; Tyler et al.,  ). Resting-state fMRI studies have also found increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere to be associated with greater language abilities (Siegel et al.,  ). These previous results, in addition to our ALE contrast indicating that only a small cluster in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) was more activated in PWA than controls across all language tasks, suggest that spared regions within and adjacent to the canonical language network, as well as more domain-general regions typically activated in controls are engaged during language tasks in PWA (Price and Crinion,  ; Crinion et al.,  ; Warren et al.,  ; Fridriksson et al.,  ; Tyler et al.,  ; Allendorfer et al.,  ; Robson et al.,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ). Although lesion volume could not be accounted for in our study, previous work indicates that increased activation of the right hemisphere results in better language outcomes, particularly when large portions of the left hemisphere are lesioned (Karbe et al.,  ; Cao et al.,  ; Blasi et al.,  ; Heiss and Thiel,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Griffis et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ). Thus, right hemisphere activations in PWA, such as in the right inferior frontal gyrus, may reflect compensation for widespread damage to portions of the left lateralized canonical language network. \n\n\n### Language Production Engages the Right Hemisphere in PWA \n  \nBilateral fronto-temporal cortices were activated by PWA during language production tasks. The ALE in control subjects indicated a similar network, but more left lateralized. Although the direct contrast of PWA vs. controls indicates that PWA did not activate any regions more than controls, the within-group ALEs depict large swaths of activation in right motor and pre-motor cortices in PWA, but much smaller right hemisphere frontal activations in controls. This discrepancy in findings could be because only half of the production studies included control data, so the between-group contrasts had reduced power compared to the within-group comparisons. The bilateral organization of the neural resources engaged by production in PWA was somewhat unexpected as it is well-established that language production is highly left lateralized (e.g., Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ). To gain more insight into the mechanisms that may be driving right hemisphere engagement during language production in post-stroke aphasia, we examined not only the brain regions activated during language production, but also those activated more for production than comprehension (section Neural Resources Engaged by Language Production vs. Comprehension). We posit that regions significantly activated in both analyses may reflect involvement in computations specific to speech production, as opposed to domain-general functions (e.g., general alertness or effort) or language production or comprehension processes. To this end, we identified the right precentral gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus to be significantly activated in both analyses in PWA; no left hemisphere regions were identified. It is possible that these regions are compensating for damage to regions which support motor speech planning for language, but certainly further work is needed to determine the specificity of these activations. This same analysis in controls identified a similar, but bilateral activation pattern: controls activated the right superior temporal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus, but also, as expected based on previous work, left inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri. The shared right superior temporal gyrus activation for PWA and controls is likely associated with processing one's own speech (Yamamoto et al.,  ) as the majority of language production tasks (22\/29) required an overt response. The right frontal activations are likely tied to articulatory processes (Price,  ). The overlap in findings in the right hemisphere for PWA and controls indicates that PWA likely engage right hemisphere resources already involved in language production to compensate for damage to the canonical language network, and that these right hemisphere resources appear to be involved in functions specific to speech production, rather than more domain-general functions. \n\nOur ALE exploring the effect of task on language production activations suggests that not all right hemisphere activation during language production in PWA is tied to language-specific processes. Instead, the production task sub-analysis suggests that some right hemisphere activation, particularly in the frontal lobes, may depend on cognitive demands inherent to the task. For example, the lexical retrieval aspects of picture naming have been associated with the left anterior and posterior temporal cortex (Damasio et al.,  ; Schwartz et al.,  ; Walker et al.,  ; Baldo et al.,  ), and the articulatory planning and programming components with frontal regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (DeLeon et al.,  ; though others implicate this region with semantic processing; e.g., Price,  ). Though underpowered with seven articles, the controls' picture naming ALE associated the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) with picture naming. The PWA's picture naming ALE was adequately powered with 15 studies and identified a similar pattern of activation to controls, but in the right hemisphere: PWA activated the right precentral gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus. Notably, this right hemisphere activation pattern in PWA during naming tasks appears to be driven by correct responses, coinciding with previous studies indicating that increased activation of the right precentral gyrus is associated with improved naming abilities in post-stroke aphasia (e.g., Fridriksson et al.,  ; Postman-Caucheteux et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ). \n\nIn contrast to picture naming tasks, word generation tasks additionally require executive functions to select words that meet task constraints (e.g., naming words that begin with the letter \u201cM\u201d without including proper nouns or repeating the same word with a different ending; Amunts et al.,  ). During word generation tasks, we find PWA to activate the left middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), and bilateral cingulate gyri, all of which have been associated with executive functions in controls in the present study, but also in past work (e.g., Schlosser et al.,  ; Fu et al.,  ; Costafreda et al.,  ; Nagels et al.,  ; Marsolais et al.,  ). The inherent differences in the use of executive functions for word generation vs. picture naming likely explains the more bilateral frontal activation PWA and controls demonstrate during word generation tasks compared to picture naming tasks. Thus, these task-specific ALEs during language production suggest that motor speech planning for language production is supported by right hemisphere homologs in post-stroke aphasia, while activations beyond these regions, in either hemisphere, are likely driven to some extent by more domain-general cognitive functions. \n\nThe relationship between behavioral performance and neural activation was sparsely reported in the studies that were possible to include in the present meta-analysis\u2014see the limitations section below for more discussion. However, we did compute ALEs for task-related activations when possible, i.e., for correct and incorrect picture naming responses (although these findings should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, i.e., nine and four studies, respectively). Correct and incorrect responses both activated right fronto-temporal regions: correct responses activated the right precentral gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus, and incorrect responses activated the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) and right middle temporal gyrus. Contrasting correct and incorrect responses further linked the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) with unsuccessful naming. Although activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus has generally been associated with better language abilities, particularly when the left inferior frontal gyrus is lesioned (Fridriksson et al.,  ; Sebastian and Kiran,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Harvey et al.,  ; Skipper-Kallal et al.,  ), it seems that the right pars triangularis and pars opercularis should be examined separately as previous work indicates that the right pars opercularis functions similarly to the left pars opercularis, but that the right pars triangularis functions differently than the left pars triangularis (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Together, our results (and others) show that the right hemisphere has a multifaceted contribution to spoken language production, but that activation of the right pars triangularis appears to be particularly detrimental to language recovery in post-stroke aphasia (Naeser et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Harvey et al.,  ). Future work using correlation or regression analyses are needed to better identify activations which significantly predict successful language production abilities in PWA. \n\n\n### Language Comprehension Engages the Left Hemisphere in PWA \n  \nDuring language comprehension tasks, PWA and controls activated several left hemisphere regions including large clusters in the posterior and anterior middle and superior temporal gyri and left inferior frontal gyrus\u2014coinciding with dual-stream models. However, findings in the right hemisphere deviated from our expectations based on previous findings of bilateral temporal activations during language comprehension: in the right hemisphere, PWA activated the right middle frontal gyrus and right claustrum but no right temporal regions, and controls did not significantly activate any right hemisphere regions. The left ventral stream activation in PWA and controls coincides with previous lesion-symptom mapping studies indicating that left temporal cortices are critical to single word (Bates et al.,  ; Newhart et al.,  ; Bonilha et al.,  ) and sentence comprehension in PWA (Dronkers et al.,  ; Thothathiri et al.,  ; Magnusdottir et al.,  ; Pillay et al.,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ). However, dual stream models (e.g., Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ) and fMRI\/PET studies in controls (e.g., LaCroix et al.,  ; Rodd et al.,  ) also reliably implicate the right hemisphere in receptive language tasks, so the lack of right temporal activations identified by the comprehension ALEs was surprising. The lack of right temporal lobe findings for comprehension may be an artifact of the types of tasks used in the studies meeting our inclusion criteria, i.e., approximately one-third were sentence-level tasks and one-third were semantic decision tasks, and both sentence-level comprehension and lexical-semantic processes are left-dominant (Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ). Thus, it is possible that the more consistent involvement of the left hemisphere for language comprehension in our study (in PWA and controls) may be driven to some extent by stimulus type. The ALEs exploring the effect of task type on the neural resources engaged by language comprehension lend some additional support to this possibility as the auditory sentence listening ALE results highly overlap with the overall language comprehension ALE, particularly in PWA. \n\nCognitive processes associated with task completion may explain recruitment of the left frontal cortex during language comprehension in PWA and controls. PWA and controls both activated the left inferior and middle frontal gyri during the comprehension tasks, as well as the left precentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and right claustrum. While it is unclear from the present study whether engagement of domain-general resources improves behavioral performance or not, the relationship between frontal regions and domain-general computations is well-established (e.g., Ries et al.,  ; Fedorenko and Blank,  ), as is the relationship between the claustrum and attention (e.g., Crick and Koch,  ; Mathur,  ; Goll et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). There is also a small body of work that links the left middle temporal gyrus with working memory (e.g., Gl\u00e4scher et al.,  ), however, it is more commonly linked to passive listening (e.g., Crinion and Price,  ; Rogalsky et al.,  ). Notably, out of all these shared activations, only the left precentral gyrus was more activated in PWA compared to controls. This increased activation of the left precentral gyrus, in a region of motor cortex closer to the hand than mouth area, is likely due to increased effort of PWA in their motor responses, not domain-general cognitive processes, as 18 of the 21 studies included in the comprehension ALE required participants to make an overt judgment about the stimulus, typically through a button press. The only region more activated by controls than PWA during comprehension tasks was a small cluster in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), an area that PWA also reliably activated. This finding suggests that non-lesioned frontal resources may play some role in language comprehension in post-stroke aphasia, but that their recruitment is not unique to PWA, and therefore may not be compensatory. However, previous work does propose that activation of domain-general resources may upregulate the remaining intact portions of the canonical language network (Diachek et al.,  ). Thus, future studies are needed to better characterize the contributions of domain-general cognitive resources to the functional reorganization of language functions in post-stroke aphasia. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nWhile the ALE methodology has several strengths, which allow it to overcome some of the limitations of individual studies (e.g., small sample size, inadequate power, differences in task), there are nonetheless limitations. First, our inclusion criteria were limited to PWA in the chronic recovery stage. Thus, our findings cannot be extended to the acute and sub-acute phases. In the acute and sub-acute phases, the current evidence indicates that language is initially supported by right hemisphere resources before gradually transitioning to left perilesional regions as language recovers (Saur et al.,  ; Nenert et al.,  ; Hartwigsen and Saur,  ). For example, Saur et al. ( ) found auditory comprehension performance to be positively correlated with acute right inferior frontal gyrus activation, but in the chronic stage, left hemisphere activation was associated with better comprehension. While a meta-analysis of acute and sub-acute language recovery in post-stroke aphasia is beyond the scope of this paper, it would certainly further our understanding of the trajectory of functional activation differences in post-stroke language recovery. \n\nThis meta-analysis is also limited in that it only partially accounts for the relationship between neural activation and behavioral performance. This is not due to a methodological limitation of the current study, but rather a function of what studies are available in the published literature for us to input into our meta-analysis. While there was (marginally) sufficient data to conduct   post-hoc   ALEs that examine activations related to correctly and incorrectly named items during picture naming, we were not able to do the same for the other production or comprehension tasks due to the multitude of ways in which performance (if reported) was described in each study (e.g., coordinates, correlations, text descriptions, figures). In total, 11\/50 tasks reported coordinates associated with behavioral performance of some kind. Of these 11 studies, nine were the picture naming tasks we computed ALEs for, and two were comprehension tasks (both semantic decision tasks). To overcome this limitation, future fMRI and PET studies of language recovery in aphasia should ideally include correlations between behavioral performance and brain activations, and separately report coordinates for correct and incorrect responses. This type of consistency in the literature will strengthen our understanding of the effectiveness of compensatory strategies to post-stroke language recovery. \n\nOur inclusion criteria were further limited to whole brain analyses and tasks that utilized a non-speech baseline task (e.g., listening to tones, rest). While each of these criteria was necessary to balance sufficient power and homogeneity (M\u00fcller et al.,  ), it did result in the exclusion of several articles ( ;  ). However, with these criteria, we still identified a sufficient number of studies to achieve appropriate power for our main analysis of interest (Eickhoff et al.,  ): how the neural resources engaged by language production vs. comprehension differ in PWA. Nonetheless, we excluded 12 studies which did not report a whole-brain analysis (e.g., ROI, VOI) and 16 studies that contrasted a language task with a language baseline (e.g., spontaneous speech vs. repeated speech). We also excluded 51 studies that did not report any, or only partial, functional activation coordinates. This heterogeneity within functional neuroimaging studies of aphasia recovery suggests a need for general fMRI and PET reporting guidelines. We suggest, that at a minimum, functional imaging studies of language recovery in post-stroke aphasia should report coordinates from whole-brain analyses where the primary task of interest is compared to rest, in addition to their primary analyses of interest, with the caveats noted that rest does not adequately control for non-language related activations and may actually subtract activation related to semantic processing from semantic decision tasks (Binder et al.,  ). We also second recommendations made by Wilson and Schneck ( ) regarding mechanisms to reduce task performance confounds and improve contrast validity. The adoption of general result reporting guidelines will reduce bias within the field as there will be greater homogeneity across studies for future meta- and mega-analyses of functional imaging studies, which will be instrumental in furthering our understanding of language recovery in post-stroke aphasia. \n\nA final limitation of the present work is our focus on studies reporting coordinates not related to treatment. Thus, from the present meta-analysis, it is difficult to infer how treatment affects the neural resources supporting language. The heterogeneity of treatment interventions and methodological approaches makes it difficult to include these studies in an ALE meta-analysis, yet there is certainly evidence that behavioral treatments can influence the neural resources that are recruited during language tasks. For example, Cherney and Small ( ) report on a case involving a PWA with a left frontal and anterior temporal lesion. Prior to treatment, the PWA had no activation in either hemisphere during an oral reading task, however, following treatment, activation of right hemisphere homologs was observed. These results further indicate that the right hemisphere appears better able to support language production when the left language network is damaged, and that this recruitment may be driven by treatment. Other studies show similar changes in the neural resources supporting language following treatment (Musso et al.,  ; Meinzer et al.,  ; Raboyeau et al.,  ; Marcotte et al.,  ; Tabei et al.,  ). Since it is well-established that language can continue to improve following therapy administered in the chronic stage (e.g., Brady et al.,  ), there is a continued need to investigate how therapy impacts the neural resources supporting language recovery. This is particularly important since therapy-induced changes in the brain likely impact all neuroimaging studies of language recovery since most PWA receive some treatment in the acute and\/or chronic stages that is not accounted for in many fMRI studies. Thus, continued work is needed to investigate likely differences in the brain regions supporting spontaneous language recovery and those that may be recruited secondary to treatment in order to better understand each process separately, as well as their interaction. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur exhaustive meta-analysis of language activations in PWA identified different intra- and inter-hemispheric functional organization patterns for production and comprehension. As expected, PWA activated the left middle and superior temporal gyri during language comprehension. We found additional intra-hemispheric activations in the left frontal gyri, but notably none in the right temporal lobes, which contrasted with what was expected based on predictions from the dual stream models (Hickok and Poeppel,  ; Friederici,  ; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,  ). Further analyses suggest that the left lateralized perilesional engagement during comprehension may be driven by a combination of stimulus complexity and recruitment of domain-general cognitive resources. In contrast to the comprehension results, production was associated with activation of the right frontal and temporal cortices in PWA. We also found that activation of regions known to support domain-general resources, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus, particularly the pars triangularis, were associated with unsuccessful naming, while activation of regions involved in motor speech planning for language production, such as the right precentral gyrus, were linked to successful naming. Overall, the within-group findings indicate that the neural resources engaged by language in post-stroke aphasia, and the engagement of the right hemisphere, differ for expressive and receptive language processes, with more right hemisphere involvement seen for production than comprehension. However, the overall similarities in areas activated by PWA and controls indicates that PWA likely engage similar neural resources during language tasks as controls, rather than recruiting unique resources. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAL and CR contributed to study conception and design.

The locations of consistent alterations suggest that highly connected hub regions in the brain might be an early target of AD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) exists on a continuum comprising a lengthy preclinical stage, a middle stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a final stage of dementia  . Symptoms usually start around the age of 65 years, except in rare patients with early onset (33\u201360\u00a0years) autosomal dominant AD (ADAD)  ,  . Drugs currently available for AD provide limited short-term treatment of AD symptoms  . Trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD dementia patients have been unsuccessful, likely because intervention at this stage is too late to affect the neurodegenerative process. The focus now is on therapeutic intervention at the MCI and\/or preclinical disease stages, with delay of dementia onset constituting a major clinical end point for clinical trials  . This approach depends on the identification of biomarkers that can aid early AD diagnosis  ,  . Currently, validated AD biomarkers are (1) low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b2 42 levels and\/or high amyloid tracer retention on positron emission tomography (PET), indicating brain amyloidosis; (2) high CSF tau levels, indicating neuronal injury; (3) temporoparietal pattern of reduced 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET, indicating brain hypometabolism, and (4) patterns of brain atrophy on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicating neurodegeneration  ,  . \n\nConnectivity in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is an emerging AD biomarker that holds promise for early diagnosis  ,  ,  . RsfMRI indirectly measures neural processing in the brain using blood oxygenation and can be used to identify spatially distributed networks  . The National Institute on Aging\u2013Alzheimer's Association lists rsfMRI functional connectivity as a potential biomarker of neuronal injury, at an early stage of validation  . The existing literature is indeed mostly composed of proof-of-concept cross-sectional comparisons of cognitively healthy elderly individuals with patients suffering from mild (MCI) or severe (dementia) AD symptoms. \n\nTo date, multiple studies have reported intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) disturbances in patients with AD dementia and MCI, presymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers, and cognitively normal individuals carrying the at-risk APOE\u03b54 allele and\/or showing evidence of amyloidosis  ,  ,  ,  . Despite such promising findings, the overall effect of AD on ICNs remains poorly characterized because of several inconsistencies in the literature, such as different acquisition protocols, processing methods, and\/or exclusion\/inclusion criteria  . Our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the consistency of intrinsic connectivity alterations in MCI and late-onset AD (LOAD) dementia across the literature. We also reviewed the burgeoning literature on connectivity abnormalities in ADAD and the at-risk APOE\u03b54 genotype. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nWe conducted a systematic review of PubMed articles up to December 3, 2015 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines  . Search terms and combinations used are provided in  . Results were filtered for duplicates within each of the two main search categories, that is, AD dementia or MCI patients ( ). Unique search results underwent further screening as described subsequently.   \nFlowchart of the study selection process. Selection process for AD and MCI studies included in the meta-analyses. Studies using rsfMRI methods dissimilar to seed-based and ICA methods, such as degree centrality or graph theory, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and regional homogeneity were not included. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; EEG, electroencephalogram; ICA, independent component analysis; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MEG, magnetoencephalography; rsfMRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nSearch results were subjected to two successive screenings with increasingly stringent criteria. The initial screen was performed on article abstracts. An article was included if the abstract indicated that it was a peer-reviewed original research article written in English and used rsfMRI to study LOAD and\/or MCI in humans. Reviews, letters, case reports, and studies with subjects in whom MCI was associated with other diseases were omitted. Following the initial screening, we applied the following inclusion criteria: (1) used seed-based or independent component analysis rsfMRI methods; (2) investigated functional connectivity between patients (AD dementia or MCI) and age-matched healthy controls (HC); and (3) reported peak coordinates of significant statistical differences in average connectivity between groups and the direction of difference. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nOne reviewer (A.B.) conducted the searches and screened for duplicates. Two reviewers (A.B. and A.T.) independently screened all unique search results for potential inclusion in the meta-analysis. Only articles passing both reviewers' approval were considered for final inclusion. For each \u201cincluded\u201d article, coordinate data of significant between-group comparisons, such as AD versus HC, were transcribed by one reviewer and checked by two others (second reviewer [A.T.] and F.H.). \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nWe performed complementary network- and voxel-based quantitative meta-analyses on six main group comparisons: pooled group with AD dementia and MCI patients termed ADMCI < HC, ADMCI > HC, MCI < HC, MCI > HC, AD < HC, and AD > HC. Although the voxel-based meta-analysis has finer spatial resolution for findings with high anatomic consistency, we assumed the network-based approach would have better sensitivity for detecting consistent involvement of anatomically distributed networks. Coordinates from articles using the same cohort were pooled under the PubMed unique identifier or PMID of the earliest publication and treated as results from a single study to avoid counting the cohort multiple times. Henceforth, an individual article will be referred to as a \u201cstudy\u201d and a group comparison yielding network and\/or localization information (e.g., ADMCI\u00a0<\u00a0HC) as a \u201ccontrast.\u201d \n\n#### Network-based statistics \n  \nWe performed network-based statistics on seed coordinates (seed statistics) to assess whether seed regions were preferentially selected from within certain networks in the literature. We also performed network-based statistics on coordinate data of significant contrasts (contrast statistics) to assess the consistency of network-level findings in the AD literature. In particular, we performed three types of contrast statistics: (1) all coordinates irrespective of seed network; and given the focus on the default mode network (DMN) in the literature, (2) coordinates associated with seeds inside the DMN only; and (3) coordinates associated with seeds outside the DMN, that is, non-DMN seeds. All analyses were conducted using a multiresolution atlas of group-level functional brain parcellations derived from an independent rsfMRI data set, the Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters\u2013Cambridge atlas ( )  . This atlas consists of nine functional parcellations capturing successively finer levels of spatial detail, of which we used parcellations at two resolutions: the first comprised seven commonly used large-scale networks (R7\u00a0atlas) and the second containing 36 networks (R36 atlas). We used R7 and R36 atlases for contrast statistics and only the R7 atlas for seed statistics. Because seeds were assigned indirectly for studies where coordinates were not provided, indirect assignment could not be performed with sufficient precision to use the R36 atlas. Assignment of seeds to one of the R7 networks was based on published coordinates, when available. When only anatomic labels were provided for seed regions, network assignment was based on (1) the center of gravity in MNI space or (2) visual approximation if no further information was available. For independent component analysis-based studies, network assignment was based on (1) network coordinates when provided or (2) visual assignment to one or more of the seven networks based on the degree of spatial overlap. \n\nWe tested the spatial consistency of both seed and peak locations using the following approach. For each study, we computed the number of coordinates falling within each network, after conversion of Talairach space coordinates into MNI space using the Lancaster transform  , when necessary. Coordinates falling outside of the gray matter mask (ICBM152) were assigned to the closest network. To remain unbiased to the number of coordinates reported per study, we computed the ratio of coordinates falling within each network to the total number of coordinates reported per study. This ratio was then averaged across studies. The significance of findings was assessed using Monte Carlo permutation tests. Using the total number of coordinates per study, we generated a random assignment of coordinates to networks, taking into consideration the volume of each network. Coordinate counts per network were normalized as described previously, followed by an averaging across studies. This Monte Carlo sampling process was repeated 10,000 times. Thereafter, we compared the distribution of the average frequency obtained from the random sampling with the frequency obtained from the meta-analysis, resulting in   P   value estimates  . Multiple comparisons across networks were accounted for using a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (qFDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05)  . The   P   values less than .05 that did not survive multiple comparisons were deemed as \u201ctrends.\u201d \n\n\n#### Voxel-based statistics \n  \nVoxel-level statistical analysis was performed using activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a widely used algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. ALE aims at delineating brain regions with above-chance convergence of reported coordinates across experiments  . Coordinates falling outside the gray matter mask were removed from the analysis. We used the in-house ALE algorithm implementation in MATLAB version 8.3.0.532, which treats each of the coordinates in a given experiment as a three-dimensional gaussian probability distribution centered at the given coordinate. The probability distributions acknowledge the spatial uncertainty associated with each experiment. For any given study, the width of the spatial uncertainty of its coordinates is determined based on empirical data on the between-subject and between-template variances representing the main components of this uncertainty  . Then, the probability distributions of all coordinates per included study are combined for each voxel, generating a modeled activation (MA) map. To limit the effect of multiple coordinates very close to one another within a given study, we used the \u201cnonadditive\u201d approach, which calculates MA maps by taking the maximum probability across overlapping gaussians  . ALE scores were computed on a voxel-by-voxel basis by taking the union across these MA maps. To distinguish between \u201ctrue\u201d and random convergence between studies (i.e., noise), ALE scores were compared with a null distribution reflecting a random spatial association between experiments (10,000 permutations). Nonparametric   P   values were assessed at a familywise error-corrected threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 on a cluster level (cluster-forming threshold:   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 at voxel level) and transformed into   t   scores for display purposes. Only contrasts including more than 18 experiments were considered, as recommended in a recent large-scale simulation study  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nThe results of the initial search, along with studies systematically excluded from inclusion in our rsfMRI meta-analyses are presented in  . Thirty-four studies totaling 1363 subjects (post pooling of identical cohorts) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The total included 352 MCI, 378 AD dementia (specifically LOAD), and 633 HC. Diagnostic criteria used per study for MCI and AD dementia are provided in the   (  and Section  ). The bulk (54%) of the studies had 20 or less subjects per group. Twenty studies (66.7%) investigated rsfMRI connectivity measures with other domains, cognition being most frequent (  n  \u00a0=\u00a011\/22 AD studies,   n  \u00a0=\u00a09\/15 MCI studies), and few with levels of amyloid burden using Pittsburgh compound B (  n  \u00a0=\u00a03), brain atrophy (  n  \u00a0=\u00a03), and structural connectivity (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01). Alterations in functional connectivity were often (  n  \u00a0=\u00a05\/9 studies) reported to be significantly correlated with episodic verbal learning and memory in MCI cohorts.   provides additional characteristics of the included rsfMRI studies, including scanner make, model, and strength, and seed region and\/or ICN investigated. A summary of commonly used preprocessing steps utilized by the studies present in our meta-analysis are provided in  .   \nCharacteristics of rsfMRI studies included in the meta-analysis \n        \n\n\n### Network-based meta-analysis \n  \n#### Seed statistics \n  \nUsing network-level statistics, we demonstrated that a disproportionately large number of studies specifically targeted the DMN ( ) irrespective of the population (ADMCI, MCI, or AD dementia) being studied.   \nSeed region network-level findings. (A) R7 atlas; (B) histograms showing the ratio of counts (or hits) across the seven networks for all seeds in ADMCI, MCI, and AD. Significant (  denoting qFDR < 0.05) prevalence of seeds in the DMN was demonstrated across all three cohorts; (C) seed region hit maps (ratio of dysconnectivity coordinates in each network) at R7. Maps are superimposed onto the anatomic International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) 152 template. x, y, and z Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are given for sagittal, coronal, and axial slices. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADMCI, AD dementia and MCI; CER, cerebellar network; DMN, default mode network; FDR, false discovery rate; FPN, frontoparietal network; HC, healthy control; LIM, limbic network; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MOT, motor network; SAL, salience network; VIS, visual network. \n  \n\n\n#### Contrast statistics \n  \nWe first examined R7 network-level statistics and all seeds combined. Aberrant functional brain connectivity was observed in ADMCI, MCI, and AD, relative to HC ( ). In the ADMCI cohort, we found both significant hypoconnectivity and hyperconnectivity in the DMN. Significant hyperconnectivity in the DMN and limbic network (LIM) was observed in the MCI cohort. There was also significant hypoconnectivity in the DMN for the AD group, which appeared as a trend for the MCI group.   \nNetwork-level findings using the R7 atlas. (A) Histograms showing per contrast the ratio of hits across the seven networks for all seeds, DMN seeds only, and non-DMN seeds. Networks with significant count (or hit) ratios are indicated by   denoting qFDR < 0.05, whereas   denotes   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 uncorrected. (B) Hit maps at R7 are shown for contrasts ADMCI < HC, ADMCI > HC, MCI < HC, MCI > HC, AD < HC, and AD > HC. Maps are superimposed onto the anatomic ICBM 152 template. x, y, and z MNI coordinates are given for sagittal, coronal, and axial slices. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease dementia; ADMCI, AD dementia and MCI; CER, cerebellar network; DMN, default mode network; FDR, false discovery rate; FPN, frontoparietal network; HC, healthy control; LIM, limbic network; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MOT, motor network; SAL, salience network; VIS, visual network. \n  \n\nWe then refined the spatial localization of effects found in R7 using the R36 atlas. Significant DMN hypoconnectivity in AD and ADMCI cohorts was detected in the precuneus (PCu) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ( ). A trend for DMN hyperconnectivity was observed in the PCu for ADMCI and in both the PCu and PCC in MCI ( ). The LIM hyperconnectivity was observed as a trend in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in MCI patients ( ).   \nNetwork-level findings using the R36 atlas. (A) Functional template at R36 showing the breakdown of the DMN and LIM into subnetworks. These two networks were significant (qFDR < 0.05 for contrasts ADMCI\u00a0<\u00a0HC for DMN, ADMCI\u00a0>\u00a0HC for DMN, MCI\u00a0>\u00a0HC for DMN and LIM, AD\u00a0<\u00a0HC for DMN) or trended toward significance (  P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 uncorrected for contrasts MCI\u00a0<\u00a0HC for DMN) for the \u201call-seeds\u201d condition at R7. (B) Histograms showing per selected contrast (as described in A), the ratio of counts (or hits) across the subnetworks. Subnetworks with significant hit ratios are indicated by   denoting qFDR < 0.05, whereas   denotes a trend with   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 uncorrected. (C) Hit maps at R36 for brain regions that overlap with significant or trending toward significance networks (as described in A). Maps are superimposed onto the anatomic ICBM 152 template. x, y, and z MNI coordinates are given for sagittal, coronal, and axial slices. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease dementia; ADMCI, AD dementia and MCI; CER, cerebellar network; DMN, default mode network; FDR, false discovery rate; FPN, frontoparietal network; HC, healthy control; LIM, limbic network; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MOT, motor network; SAL, salience network; VIS, visual network. \n  \n\nFinally, we investigated the robustness of findings with respect to the selection of seeds (DMN, non-DMN, or all combined), using the R7 atlas. Significant network-level findings derived from all seeds combined, as reported previously, replicated when using DMN seeds alone ( A). In addition, a trend toward hypoconnectivity in MCI became significant using DMN seeds only. When focusing on non-DMN seed studies, no significant effects were observed in the DMN, as expected. The only significant result was hyperconnectivity of the salience network (SAL) in ADMCI, also present as a trend in AD subjects. \n\n\n\n### Voxel-based meta-analysis \n  \nALE results demonstrated significant hypoconnectivity in the PCC and PCu in the ADMCI and AD studies ( ,  ), consistent with our network-level findings using R7 and R36 atlases. This observation was made both for all seeds combined and DMN-only seeds ( ,  ).   \nLocation of significant convergence of the voxel-level findings. Regions exhibiting significant rsfMRI abnormalities for contrasts ADMCI\u00a0<\u00a0HC, AD < HC, and AD > HC. Activation likelihood estimation images were thresholded at   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.05 (cluster-level family wise error or FWE corrected for multiple comparisons; cluster-forming threshold   P  \u00a0<\u00a0.001 at the voxel level) and displayed as   t   scores, with hyperconnectivity in red-orange and hypoconnectivity in blue-green. Maps are superimposed onto the anatomic ICBM 152 template. x, y, and z MNI coordinates are given for sagittal, coronal, and axial slices. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease dementia; ADMCI, AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment; HC, healthy control; rsfMRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n  \n\nUnlike the network-level analysis, using ALE we found diminished connectivity in the primary visual cortex, both in ADMCI and AD. This was observed for all seeds combined as well as for DMN-only seeds in ADMCI and DMN-only seeds in AD. Finally, significant hyperconnectivity was observed in AD in the anterior insula ( ,  ), consistent with the trend in the LIM observed using the R36 atlas. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe report on a systematic meta-analysis of rsfMRI brain connectivity dysfunction in LOAD, using voxel-, region-, and network-level statistics. Our results demonstrated consistent connectivity alterations both within and outside of the DMN. \n\n### Connectivity changes in the DMN \n  \n#### Late-onset AD \n  \nOur results revealed a consistent decrease in DMN connectivity in the ADMCI and AD cohorts, particularly in the PCu and PCC, for all resolutions of meta-analysis. This finding is in line with previous meta-analyses centered on the DMN  ,  , and a recent study published after we completed our analysis  . DMN deterioration appears robust to the choice of analytical approaches, as previous meta-analyses largely included studies measuring regional homogeneity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation. Moreover, our results support previous literature reporting on the vulnerability of the DMN to multiple AD pathophysiology  . \n\nUnlike our robust findings in AD subjects, DMN hypoconnectivity in MCI could only be demonstrated using\u00a0network-level statistics, suggesting a weaker, more distributed effect in MCI. However, we recently reported decreased DMN connectivity in a large multisite MCI cohort with a connectome-wide approach  . The modest findings of our present meta-analysis may be because of a lack of statistical power from having multiple, small, single-site samples. Clinical heterogeneity might also have played a role, that is, only a subset of MCI patients develop AD dementia  ,  , and there may be pathologic subtypes  . We also demonstrated DMN hyperconnectivity in MCI and ADMCI using network-level statistics. These changes may reflect both functional disconnection and compensation in response to damage at earlier stages of neurodegeneration, as well as direct or indirect pathologic mechanisms  . Moreover, there is some uncertainty of the specific nodes that actually show aberrant connectivity in our network-level analysis. This may give rise to apparent contradictory results. \n\n\n#### Early onset AD \n  \nDMN hypoconnectivity of similar magnitude to LOAD was demonstrated in early onset non\u2013ADAD  ,  , whereas in ADAD, DMN hypoconnectivity was slightly more pronounced than that in LOAD  . Altered DMN connectivity was observed in asymptomatic mutation carriers (  PSEN1  ,   PSEN2  , or   APP  ) many years before the age at which they were expected to develop symptoms  ,  ,  , suggesting that aberrant connectivity may be a very early biomarker for AD. \n\n\n#### Cognitively normal individuals at genetic risk for LOAD \n  \nAltered DMN connectivity has been reported in cognitively normal APOE\u03b54 carriers compared with non-APOE\u03b54 carriers. These alterations were found across all age groups, that is, elderly  ,  ,  ,  , middle-aged  ,  ,  , and young adults  ,  , and were associated with worse cognition in middle-aged and elderly carriers  ,  ,  . Studies have also reported connectivity changes in the DMN in the absence of Pittsburgh compound B\u2013detectable brain amyloidosis  ,  ,  , further validating the potential of rsfMRI connectivity as an early marker of synaptic and neuronal dysfunction in AD. \n\n\n#### Cognitively normal elderly at risk for LOAD \n  \nAberrant DMN dysconnectivity, particularly reduced connectivity between the anterior and posterior DMN, has been associated with aging and age-related cognitive decline  ,  . DMN hypoconnectivity may arise as early as middle age  ,  , with decreases occurring at differing rates between sexes   most likely due to the differential effect of sex on AD risk  . Reduced DMN integrity has also been reported in cognitively normal elderly with abnormal levels of CSF amyloid or tau proteins  , as well as PET-detectable cerebral amyloidosis  . These results suggest that some of the effects related to normal aging in the literature may be driven by preclinical AD. Very few studies examined the interactions between age, sex, LOAD, and rsfMRI connectivity, which is clearly an important avenue for future work. \n\n\n\n### Connectivity changes outside the DMN \n  \nOur meta-analysis confirmed that intrinsic connectivity disruptions in LOAD are not confined to the DMN. We found increased connectivity in the SAL in ADMCI and AD. Abnormal SAL connectivity has now been reported in another LOAD study   published after we completed our meta-analysis and has also been demonstrated in ADAD  , APOE\u03b54 carriers  ,  , and the elderly  , with connectivity increases highlighted in APOE\u03b54 carriers. With the anterior insula as a key hub, the SAL plays a pivotal role in network switching between the DMN and frontoparietal network (FPN), two networks exhibiting competitive interactions during cognitive information processing  . Association of heightened SAL connectivity with reduced DMN connectivity in AD suggests that progressive DMN impairment may be deleterious to SAL function  . \n\nWe also found increased connectivity in the LIM in MCI. Heightened LIM connectivity has been reported in early onset, non-ADAD patients  , and in individuals with subjective memory impairment  . The effect of APOE\u03b54 carriage on LIM connectivity, however, lacks consensus  ,  ,  . Since LIM hyperconnectivity in early onset AD patients was shown to correlate positively with memory performance, it is likely that increased connectivity in this network contributes to preserving function in the face of medial temporal lobe pathology  . \n\n\n### Selective vulnerability of multimodal networks in AD \n  \nThe DMN, SAL, and FPN are multimodal networks that interconnect cortical regions associated with various cognitive functions, and they have been demonstrated computationally to support integrative information processing at the cost of being vulnerable to early and fast spreading of insults  . Supporting this theoretical finding is the recent observation that tau and amyloid-\u03b2, despite their independent patterns of spatial deposition, overlap with brain tissue loss in hub regions of multimodal networks  . These multimodal networks are also metabolically expensive and display higher rates of cerebral blood flow, aerobic glycolysis, and oxidative glucose metabolism  . The high-value\/high-cost characteristics of the DMN, SAL, and FPN may make them vulnerable to AD-associated pathogenic processes, such as metabolic dysfunction\/oxidative stress, and accumulation of toxic proteins, such as amyloid-\u03b2  . The hypothesis that multimodal networks\/regions are particularly susceptible to AD-associated pathophysiological processes may explain our finding of consistent alterations of these networks. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur literature search did not identify an abundance of rsfMRI literature in AD and MCI cohorts, which clearly expresses the need for additional research. The relatively low number of experiments that met our inclusion criteria might have underpowered our voxel-level findings, especially for the MCI contrasts. In addition, our search demonstrated that typical studies featured small samples, and also that analytical methods were quite variable in the field (a main reason for excluding an article was due to methodology used). This setting is particularly amenable to questionable research practices, including \u201cp-hacking\u201d (testing several methods, reporting only one). Given the near absence of negative results reporting in the field, on one hand, and the large size of the rsfMRI field, on the other hand, there is no question that some amount of publication bias is also present. Meta-analytical tools, such as funnel plots, are available to detect both selective reporting and p-hacking but are not feasible given current reporting practices in the rsfMRI community  . \n\nAnother limitation of our study is experimental heterogeneity, in terms of population recruitment, scan acquisition (e.g., scanner make and model, scanning parameters), and processing choices  ,  ,  . The prominence of the DMN in our results partly reflects the focus on this network in the literature, which we quantified using seed statistics. Hypothesis-driven analyses on the DMN are attractive for assessing connectivity changes in small samples; as such analyses will have good statistical power if the DMN truly carries the larger effects in the brain. However, full-brain studies will be required to get a more comprehensive view on AD-related changes in rsfMRI network connectivity using meta-analyses. The current trend toward large public samples  ,   is enabling unbiased meta-analyses, pooling neuroimaging data across many studies instead of relying on published coordinates. This will hopefully resolve most of the aforementioned limitations in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur meta-analysis demonstrated consistent connectivity alterations in the DMN, SAL, and LIM in the spectrum of LOAD, supporting the use of resting-state connectivity as a biomarker of AD.    Research in Context   \n  \nSystematic review: We conducted a systematic review of PubMed-indexed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies in accordance with the \u201cPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\u201d guidelines. We included studies that investigated differences in functional connectivity, relative to controls, between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and\/or mild cognitive impairment, and reported coordinates of findings. \n  \nInterpretation: Typical rsfMRI functional connectivity studies in AD suffer from low statistical power. Our meta-analysis quantifies if and where convergent findings have been reported in the literature and strengthens the evidence for the use of rsfMRI as an AD biomarker. \n  \nFuture directions: A disproportionately large portion of studies specifically investigated the default mode network, based on well-grounded hypotheses on AD pathophysiology. It is unclear if AD truly has larger effects on default-mode connectivity because of limited power to examine other networks.

{"text":"Wang, Jue and Zhang, Jia-Rong and Zang, Yu-Feng and Wu, Tao\nGigascience, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nConsistent decreased activity in the putamen in Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis and an independent validation of resting-state fMRI\n\n# Keywords\n\nParkinson's disease\nspontaneous brain activity\ncoordinate-based meta-analysis\nputamen\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has frequently been used to investigate local spontaneous brain activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) in a whole-brain, voxel-wise manner. To quantitatively integrate these studies, we conducted a coordinate-based (CB) meta-analysis using the signed differential mapping method on 15 studies that used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and 11 studies that used regional homogeneity (ReHo). All ALFF and ReHo studies compared PD patients with healthy controls. We also performed a validation RS-fMRI study of ALFF and ReHo in a frequency-dependent manner for a novel dataset consisting of 49 PD and 49 healthy controls. \n\n\n## Findings \n  \nDecreased ALFF was found in the left putamen in PD by meta-analysis. This finding was replicated in our independent validation dataset in the 0.027\u20130.073 Hz band but not in the conventional frequency band of 0.01\u20130.08 Hz. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nFindings from the current study suggested that decreased ALFF in the putamen of PD patients is the most consistent finding. RS-fMRI is a promising technique for the precise localization of abnormal spontaneous activity in PD. However, more frequency-dependent studies using the same analytical methods are needed to replicate these results. \n\nTrial registration: NCT NCT03439163. Registered 20 February 2018, retrospectively registered. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological degenerative disorder that is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. The main pathological feature of PD is the progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and putamen [ ]. However, it remains unclear how these pathological changes lead to parkinsonian symptoms. To answer this question, many neuroimaging studies that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have investigated PD-related neural abnormalities and found that PD patients showed abnormal activity in the striatum and brain stem, as well as in other brain regions [ ]. Most fMRI studies have been focused on motor-related neural changes in PD. Herz et al. conducted a coordinate-based (CB) meta-analysis on motor task-related functional neuroimaging studies [ ] and found a consistently decreased activation in the posterior portion of the putamen in PD patients during motor tasks. \n\nWhile task-related fMRI holds the advantage of being able to assess specific activation corresponding to specific tasks, different tasks activate different brain regions and hence the results are less suitable for meta-analysis. Resting-state (RS) fMRI has two intrinsic advantages: it is noninvasive and task free. Task-free RS is a simpler experimental design for PD investigation. Therefore, RS-fMRI design is very similar across studies, and is more suitable for meta-analysis. There have been three published CB meta-analysis investigations of RS-fMRI studies in PD [ ]. The CB meta-analysis study by Tahmasian and colleagues included 28 publications, in which a variety of RS-fMRI analytical methods were used, such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) or its derivative, fractional ALFF (fALFF); regional homogeneity (ReHo); and various network analytical methods [ ]. In contrast, the analytical methods in the original studies that were included in the two CB meta-analysis studies by Pan and colleagues were very similar, i.e., ReHo [ ] and ALFF\/fALFF [ ], respectively. In between-group comparison studies, ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo are usually used in \u201cvoxel-wise whole-brain\u201d analysis with very similar preprocessing parameters across studies. Therefore, these studies are suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis [ ]. In the CB meta-analysis studies by Pan and colleagues, the authors found decreased ReHo [ ] and decreased ALFF [ ] in the putamen, which was consistent with the hypothesis of decreased dopaminergic function in the putamen [ ]. \n\nFrequency-dependent or subfrequency band analysis is drawing more and more attention in RS-fMRI studies since the work by Zuo and colleagues [ ]. They observed a higher RS-fMRI fALFF at a frequency band of 0.027\u20130.073 Hz (namely, slow-4) than that at 0.01\u20130.027 Hz (namely, slow-5) in the basal ganglia, which is a critical subcortical area in PD pathology. However, only two of the previous ALFF or ReHo PD studies investigated subfrequency bands. Hou and colleagues found similar decreased ALFF in the putamen for the two subfrequency bands [ ], but Zhang and colleagues did not find abnormal ALFF in the putamen in any of the two frequency bands [ ]. Although higher-frequency band (>0.1 Hz) of the RS-fMRI signal could be contaminated by physiological noise, including respiratory noise (around 0.3 Hz) and heart beats (around 1.2 Hz), quite a few studies found that RS-fMRI signal at higher frequency bands was of pathophysiological [ ,  ] and physiological [ ] significance. It would be interesting to perform more studies at subfrequency bands in RS-fMRI studies on PD. \n\nIn the current study, we carried out a CB meta-analysis on previous PD resting-state fMRI studies using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo separately, similar to previous meta-analysis [ ,  ]. However, we also added five articles that were published after the CB meta-analysis articles by Pan and colleagues [ ,  ]. Furthermore, to validate the results of our CB meta-analysis, we analyzed ALFF and ReHo in the conventional frequency band, as well as in subfrequency bands, and we studied an independent and relatively large cohort of PD patients and healthy controls. \n\nIt should be noted that both ALFF and ReHo are metrics for measuring local activity. Both methods have been widely used in studies on brain disorders in whole-brain voxel-wise analysis. A study showed that ReHo and ALFF could reveal convergent abnormal local activity in some brain areas [ ], but ReHo and ALFF also detected different brain regions with abnormal brain activity. The two methods are very different mathematically. ReHo depicts the local synchronization of the time course of neighboring voxels, while ALFF depicts the fluctuation amplitude of every signal time course. Hence, both separate and combined analyses are necessary. Therefore, in addition to separate meta-analysis on ALFF and ReHo, we were also interested in combining both ALFF and ReHo studies into our meta-analysis. Furthermore, we investigated the frequency-specific features of PD-related brain activity in an independent dataset to improve our understanding of the neurophysiological changes underlying PD. \n\n\n## Data Description \n  \nThe data for the current study included two parts. Part 1 was for a CB meta-analysis including coordinates,   t   value, and sample size. These data were extracted from published articles that used RS-fMRI in PD. Part 2 was for validation purposes and used RS-fMRI data from 80 patients with PD and 52 healthy participants. After quality control (see details in Analyses section), 49 patients with PD and 49 healthy participants were entered into the final analysis. All data in the current study can be used for further validation and exploratory studies. \n\n\n## Analyses \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nOn 28 June 2017, we conducted a PubMed literature search [ ] using the search strings as follows: ((Parkinson[Title\/Abstract]) OR (Parkinson's[Title\/Abstract])) AND ((\u201cresting-state fMRI\u201d OR ALFF OR ReHo OR \u201cdefault mode network\u201d)). A total of 138 articles were retrieved. \n\nWe also reviewed articles and references to retrieve additional articles. An additional study, using the Kendall coefficient of concordance (KCC) method, was included in the current meta-analysis after carefully reviewing a recent publication of meta-analysis [ ] because KCC is the same algorithm as that of ReHo [ ]. Only RS-fMRI studies written in English were eligible. The inclusion criteria were as follows: articles reporting original data; analyses using ReHo or ALFF\/fALFF and based on the whole brain; articles reporting results on RS data in adult PD patients and studies aimed at comparing PD with healthy controls; studies reporting results with coordinates from group comparisons (PD vs healthy controls) in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space; patients were in an off-state; and patients were pretreatment, presurgery, and noncomorbid. According to these criteria, two investigators (J.W., H.-x.W.) independently searched and selected the articles from PubMed. Final decisions were made by a neurologist (T.W.); 26 RS-fMRI studies (15 studies using ALFF\/fALFF [ ,  ,  ] and 11 studies using ReHo [ ]) were included in the present CB meta-analysis (Table  ). \n  \nOriginal articles included in the present meta-analysis study \n    \n\n### Meta-analysis of ALFF and ReHo studies \n  \nSigned differential mapping (SDM) software (version 5.141 for Windows) [ ] was used for meta-analysis. One feature of SDM is \u201cthe representation of both positive differences and negative differences in the same map, thus obtaining a signed differential map (\u201cSDM\u201d).\u201d Another feature is \u201cthe use of effect sizes (leading to effect-size SDM or \u201cES-SDM\u201d) ].\u201d Two directions of abnormality were probed: RS activity increases and decreases in PD patients compared with healthy controls. ALFF measures the fluctuation amplitude of the low-frequency band (usually 0.01\u20130.08 Hz) of a single time course [ ], and fALFF is the ratio of the ALFF to the fluctuation amplitude of the full-frequency band [ ]. ReHo measures the local synchronization of the time courses of the nearest neighboring voxels (usually 27 voxels) [ ]. Although ALFF and ReHo showed significant correlation in most voxels [ ], a previous comparison study showed that ALFF and ReHo could detect different abnormal brain areas [ ]. Therefore, similar to two previous CB meta-analysis articles [ ,  ], we first performed meta-analysis separately on ALFF\/fALFF studies (15 studies) and ReHo studies (11 studies, including 13 comparisons) (Table  ) and then combined ALFF and ReHo (see below). The analysis procedure included listing the peak coordinates and   t  -values from each study; using the files prepared in i) to recreate the effect-size maps (standard stereotactic space) of the original studies with 10 Monte Carlo randomizations and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) 20 mm; and generating the mean map in a voxel-wise manner weighted by the sample size, variance, and between-study heterogeneity. A combined threshold of   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected for false discovery rate [FDR]) with peak height Z value >1 was adopted as recommended in the SDM, together with extent threshold >10 voxels [ ,  ]. \n\nIn addition to the above separate meta-analysis on ALFF and ReHo as by Pan and colleagues [ ,  ], we further performed a combined meta-analysis of all ALFF and ReHo studies (15 ALFF and 13 ReHo = 28 comparisons; Table  ). Results were also thresholded at   P   < 0.001, uncorrected for FDR, with a peak height Z value >1 and extent threshold >10 voxels [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Validation study of ALFF and ReHo on an independent dataset of RS-fMRI \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nThis validation study contains RS-fMRI data of 80 patients with PD and 52 healthy participants. After head motion control, 12 patients were excluded, and matching for age and gender was conducted. A total of 98 right-handed participants, made up of 49 PD patients (26 females) and 49 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (26 females) were enrolled in the final analysis (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation: 62.3 y \u00b1 8.0, 61.8 y \u00b1 8.3, respectively; Table  ). The PD diagnoses were based on the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria [ ]. Patients were assessed using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale III [ ] and the Hoehn and Yahr disability scale [ ]. Exclusion criteria included history of head trauma, substance abuse, or psychiatric disorder. For healthy controls, additional exclusion criteria included any history of neuropsychiatric disorders. The present investigation was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation. \n  \nDemographic characteristics \n  \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nfMRI data were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (Trio system; Siemens Magnetom scanner, Erlangen, Germany) with gradient-echo echo-plannar imaging sequences. Whole brain fMRI scanning with three slightly different parameters was carried out (see Table  ). All participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax, remain motionless, not think of anything in particular, and not fall asleep. Foam pads were used to minimize head motion. \n  \nParameters of the three resting-state fMRI datasets \n  \n\n### Data analyses \n  \nThe minimum time points were 180 (dataset 1, Table  ). The extra time points of datasets 2 and 3 were discarded and hence 180 time points were left. The RS-fMRI data preprocessing included the following steps: 1) discarding the first 10 volumes to allow the signal to reach equilibrium and the subjects to adapt to the circumstances; 2) correcting for the acquisition time delay between slices; 3) rigid-body realigning for estimation and correction of the motion displacement (participants whose head motion exceeded 2 mm in translation or 2 degrees in rotation in any direction were excluded); 4) normalizing to MNI space using the echo-plannar imaging template in statistical parametric mapping 8 [ ]; 5) regressing out of the six motion parameters; 6) removing the linear trend; and 7) band-pass filtering for five frequency bands (0\u20130.01, 0.01\u20130.027, 0.027\u20130.073, 0.073\u20130.198, and 0.198\u20130.25 Hz, as well as 0.01\u20130.08 Hz). Most of the previous PD studies investigating amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation used ALFF but not fALFF. We therefore analyzed ALFF only. For calculating ALFF, data were further smoothed, with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM.ALFF was then calculated using the REST toolkit [ ]. For ReHo, the calculation was performed first, and then the 6 mm FWHM smoothing was carried out on the ReHo maps. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nTwo-sample   t   tests were performed to explore the differences between the two groups in a voxel-wise manner for ALFF and ReHo, respectively, for each subfrequency band as well for the conventional frequency band (0.01\u20130.08 Hz). Monte Carlo simulation (AlphaSim) was applied for the multiple comparison correction within a whole brain mask by using DPABI_V3.0 [ ] (DPABI,  ) software [ ]. DPABI estimates the smoothness of each statistic map and hence yields effective kernel size of smoothness for each map. Then, the smoothness was used for the correction. It is believed that simply taking the size of the Gaussian kernel that was applied during preprocessing to AlphaSim is incorrect [ ]. DPABI prevents that sort of error by estimated effective smoothness. Although Monte Carlo simulations in DPABI are based on AFNI's 3dClustSim, the specific algorithm used is not by the bug reported in Eklund et al., 2016 since version 1.2_141101 [ ,  ]. The corresponding estimated smoothness and minimal cluster size are listed in Table   for each frequency band of ALFF and ReHo. The voxel-level   P   value was set at <0.001 as recommended [ ]. The corrected   P   value was <0.05. \n  \nEstimated smoothness and cluster size of T maps (PD vs healthy controls based on validation study) \n  \n\n### Findings \n  \n#### Meta-analysis on ALFF and ReHo studies \n  \nIn the meta-analysis of SDM for ALFF, an increased ALFF in PD patients compared with controls was found in the right inferior temporal gyrus.

In addition, decreased ReHo was observed in the right putamen and right precentral gyrus (BA 6) in PD patients (Fig.  , Table  ). \n  \nReHo differences between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls in coordinate-based meta-analysis (  P   < 0.001, uncorrected for alse discovery rate; peak height   Z   value > 1; extent threshold >10 voxels).

PD patients also had decreased ReHo in the left inferior occipital gyrus at 0\u20130.01 Hz and increased ReHo in the right middle frontal gyrus at 0.073\u20130.198 Hz and 0.198\u20130.25 Hz (Fig.  , Table  ). The other frequency bands, including conventional 0.01\u20130.08 Hz, did not show significant differences of ALFF or ReHo. Among these brain regions, the decreased ALFF at 0.027\u20130.073 Hz in the left putamen was overlapped with our findings of decreased ALFF in the meta-analysis. \n  \nALFF\/ReHo differences between PD and HC in the validation study.

For example, there was altered local activity in the putamen and the pre-SMA. A finding of decreased ALFF in the left putamen from our validation study was very consistent with the results of our CB meta-analysis, which was also consistent with findings from a previous CB meta-analysis [ ]. The increased ReHo in the validation dataset was not consistent with our CB meta-analysis results and the previous one [ ]. \n\n### Methodology: whole-brain voxel-wise comparison and image-based meta-analysis \n  \nCompared with positron emission tomography, RS-fMRI has the advantages of lower cost, better temporal resolution, and no ionizing radiation. Since 2009 when the first PD RS-fMRI article was published [ ], approximately 150 research articles have described RS-fMRI in PD. To ensure that the analytical methods were as similar as possible, two previous CB meta-analysis articles included only ALFF [ ] or ReHo [ ], because many other analytical methods are not \u201cwhole-brain voxel-wise\u201d and hence not suitable to CB meta-analysis. For example, the \u201cseed\u201d location of seed-based functional connectivity varies greatly across studies, and for independent component analysis, researchers may be interested in any network or component. Likewise, a very small portion of the existing graph theory studies are whole-brain voxel-wise [ ]. Instead, most of them are region based due to the computational cost of this method. Unfortunately, because only a small portion of RS-fMRI studies have used whole-brain voxel-wise analytic methods, the two previous CB meta-analysis studies have included only a limited number (10 or fewer) of articles in which the same analytical methods were used. After our careful screening of PD RS-fMRI articles, we found a few additional eligible studies that used whole-brain voxel-wise analytic methods, i.e., ALFF\/fALFF (15 papers) and ReHo (11 article; Table  ). It has been suggested that for meta-analysis, unthresholded effect size maps (named image-based) were better than coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. Therefore, effect size maps from whole-brain voxel-wise comparison should be widely performed in future RS-fMRI studies. \n\n\n### Methodology: ALFF vs ReHo \n  \nALFF measures the amplitude of fluctuation of every single voxel, while ReHo measures the local synchronization of the nearest neighboring voxels. The two metrics are the two most widely used methods for depicting local activity [ ]. Also, it has been shown that ALFF and ReHo were among the RS-fMRI metrics that have the highest test\u2013retest reliability [ ]. Although the ALFF and ReHo methods are mathematically different, both methods measure the local activity of spontaneous brain activity. A previous study compared the two methods in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ ] and found a few convergent abnormal regions for ALFF and ReHo, albeit some divergent abnormal activity already existed. Therefore, we performed a combined meta-analysis on all ALFF and ReHo studies. It was shown that the results of combined meta-analysis of all ALFF and ReHo studies looked like complimentary results of separate meta-analysis mutually between ALFF and ReHo. An interesting result is the decreased spontaneous activity in the bilateral putamen. These results were replicated in the independent validation dataset. Comparing the results of ALFF and ReHo either by meta-analysis or independent validation analysis, almost no convergent results were found for the two metrics. More studies are needed in the future to compare the two methods. \n\n\n### Consistent decreased ALFF in the left putamen \n  \nThere was decreased ALFF in the left putamen in PD patients in both our validation dataset and CB meta-analysis investigation. These findings align with previous findings that the striatal dysfunction in PD has been consistently reported in previous studies [ ]. It has been established that dopamine uptake is reduced in the putamen in PD [ ], which is a critical factor that leads to major parkinsonian symptoms. Cells loss from the substantia nigra in PD results in dopamine expending in the striatum, with putamen being affected [ ,  ]. It has been reported that  F-dopa uptake in putamen in PD is associated with the clinical severity of locomotor disability, and  F-dopa reduction in putamen is associated is associated with the degree of rigidity and bradykinesia [ ,  ]. A recent meta-analysis of motor-related task fMRI studies also found decreased activity in the putamen in PD patients [ ]. Notably, in our validation dataset, we found that the decreased ALFF was mainly found in a subfrequency band of 0.027\u20130.073 Hz, namely, slow-4 [ ]. Either ALFF or ReHo abnormality in the left putamen was not found in the conventional frequency band of 0.01\u20130.08 Hz. We suggest that future RS-fMRI studies pay close attention ton subfrequency analysis in order to validate this finding. Further, the physiological importance of each subfrequency band of RS-fMRI should also be investigated. \n\n\n### Inconsistent ReHo and ALFF findings \n  \nThere was decreased ReHo in the right putamen in PD patients in both our CB meta-analysis and a previous CB meta-analysis [ ]. However, no ReHo changes were found in the validation dataset (Fig.  ). This discrepancy in findings between ALFF and ReHo might be explained by the differences in the two methods as discussed in the Methodology: ALFF vs ReHo section. Further, except for the consistent results in the left putamen in ALFF, most meta-analysis results were not reproducible in the validation analysis on the independent dataset. Possible reasons include the small number of original studies, biased negative findings after thresholding in the original studies, different frequency bands, and heterogeneity of PD patients. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nA few limitations should be addressed. First, it has been proposed that at least 20 experiments should be included in a meta-analysis [ ]. Although the design of RS-fMRI is very similar across studies, too many analytic methods have been applied in studies of brain disorders. Only a small portion of these studies used whole-brain voxel-wise analysis, which is suitable to CB meta-analysis. Reproductive studies using similar analytic methods should be performed. Second, image-based meta-analysis on the unthresholded   t   maps is better than coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ]. We suggest that future studies use the same analytic methods, re-analyze the RS-fMRI data from multiple research centers, and perform image-based meta-analysis while taking PD symptoms into account. Third, although the decreased ALFF in the left putamen was the most consistent finding, other brain regions should not be overlooked. In addition to the consistent decreased activity in the left putamen, the current meta-analysis also found increased activity in a few cortical regions, which were consistent with three previous meta-analytic articles [ ]. It should be noted that these meta-analytic articles, including the current one, recruited the same studies to some extent. Therefore, it is not surprising that these articles found similar abnormal regions. However, most of the abnormal regions were not reproducible in the current validation study on an independent dataset. Future studies could increase sample size and focus on brain regions beyond the putamen. \n\n\n## Summary \n  \nWe performed a CB meta-analysis of local activity using RS-fMRI in PD patients and healthy controls and also a validation study using a novel dataset in a frequency-dependent manner. The most consistent result was abnormal ALFF in the left putamen, as evidenced by decreased ALFF in the CB meta-analysis and decreased ALFF of PD in our independent dataset. However, owing to the limited number of original studies that were suitable for CB meta-analysis, our results need to be further validated. \n\n\n## Potential implications \n  \nThe consistent finding in the current study is the abnormally decreased ALFF in the left putamen.

We performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis, using the monetary incentive delay task, to identify which brain regions are implicated in different reward phases in functional magnetic resonance imaging in SZ. A total of 17 studies (368 SZ and 428 controls) were included in the reward anticipation, and 10 studies (229 SZ and 281 controls) were included in the reward outcome. Our meta-analysis revealed that during anticipation, patients showed hypoactivation in the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, median cingulate cortex (MCC), amygdala, precentral gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus compared with controls. Striatum hypoactivation was negatively associated with negative symptoms and positively associated with the proportion of second-generation antipsychotic users (percentage of SGA users). During outcome, patients displayed hyperactivation in the striatum, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, postcentral gyrus, and MCC, and hypoactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Hypoactivity of mPFC during outcome was negatively associated with positive symptoms. Moderator analysis showed that the percentage of SGA users was a significant moderator of the association between symptom severity and brain activity in both the anticipation and outcome stages. Our findings identified the neural substrates for different reward phases in SZ and may help explain the neuropathological mechanisms underlying reward processing deficits in the disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia (SZ) is one of the most severe neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by diverse symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders [ ,  ]. Abnormal reinforcement learning and representations of reward value are present in SZ, and these impairments can manifest as deficits in reward decision making [ ]. Accumulating evidence suggests that reward processing abnormalities in SZ patients may arise from dopaminergic dysfunction within the mesocorticolimbic circuit, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum (VS, including the nucleus accumbens), ventral pallidum, amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus [ \u2013 ]. Dysregulated dopaminergic modulation of reward processing is considered to be fundamental to the symptoms of SZ and is often reported to be an important predictor of poor functional outcome [ ,  ]. \n\nBased on recent studies, reward processing includes two phases temporally, namely, the reward anticipation and reward outcome [ ]. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task is the most widely used task to probe neural substrates of different reward processing stages in healthy individuals and those with mental disorders [ ,  ]. In the MID task, subjects see a cue indicating that they will have an opportunity to obtain a certain amount of monetary reward, respond to a given target, and receive immediate feedback on whether they have successfully obtained the reward (see  ). The anticipation phase is defined by the introduction of a cue informing participants about an upcoming potential reward, and the outcome phase refers to the period when a reward is presented [ ]. The investigation of reward processing in healthy adults revealed that anticipation of reward was associated with the activation of multiple regions including the striatum, ACC, anterior insula, and the central executive and default networks [ ], while the OFC and mPFC were activated during the reward outcome phase [ ]. This implies that the neural substrates of the two stages are likely to be associated with distinct patterns of activation and connectivity [ ]. \n\nTo date, present studies have examined and identified several likely neural substrates for the anticipation and outcome of incentives in SZ. However, due to the heterogeneity of reward paradigms and the bias introduced by including region of interest (ROI) analysis, the existing results are still inconsistent. During reward anticipation, although several studies revealed reduced VS activity in SZ [ \u2013 ], other studies reported reduced activations in the posterior cingulate cortex and temporal regions [ ]. Compared with healthy controls (HC), activation in the VS in patients was found to be either reduced or not significantly changed (Supplementary Table  ). Reward anticipation abnormalities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms, such as anhedonia and avolition in SZ patients [ ,  ]. However, there is also evidence suggesting correlations between anticipation dysfunction and the severity of positive symptoms [ ,  ]. In terms of reward outcome, the role of striatum is relatively uncertain. Some behavioral and neuroimaging data have shown intact responses during the outcome phase [ ,  ], while other data have shown either hyperactivity or hypoactivity in the striatum during monetary receipt [ \u2013 ]. Most studies report that outcome-related neural response in SZ patients is associated with both positive symptoms [ ,  ] and negative symptoms [ ]. Such inconsistencies may be attributed to the small sample size, sample heterogeneity, and differences in paradigm design among studies. \n\nCurrently, an updated quantitative meta-analysis method called seed-based mapping (SDM) has emerged as a useful approach to identify spatially consistent brain changes reported in the literature through the use of the coordinate information reported in each study. Few meta-analyses thus far have focused on dissociated neural responses during reward anticipation and outcome in SZ, although an increasing number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported potential neural substrates of reward processing. Radua and his colleagues used meta-analysis to reveal alterations in VS activity during reward anticipation, feedback, and prediction error [ ]. However, VS activation in this meta-analysis was based on ROI approach, which would be affected by the different VS definitions across the included studies. Furthermore, both individuals with SZ and those at high risk for psychosis were included in the study, complicating the reported results. Another meta-analysis performed a whole-brain meta-analysis but only focused on the anticipation of reward tasks [ ], while the neural substrates underlying different reward processing phases remain unclear. \n\nHere, we performed an in-depth meta-analysis to elucidate the neurobiological basis underlying different stages of reward processing between SZ and HC. To overcome the limitations of previous meta-analysis work, we only included fMRI studies that performed a whole-brain analysis of patients as they completed the MID paradigm and analyzed reward anticipation and reward outcome independently. We also explored whether brain responses during different reward processes were associated with symptom severity using meta-regression analysis. We expected that reward anticipation and reward outcome would recruit different brain regions in SZ patients, and that the abnormal neural activations during different stages of reward processing would be closely related to the severity of symptoms. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study search and selection \n  \nFollowing recommended guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement [ ], two authors independently searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases for relevant articles from January 2000 to May 2021, using the following terms: (1) \u201cschizophrenia\u201d OR \u201cschizophrenic\u201d OR \u201cschizoaffective\u201d OR \u201cpsychoses\u201d OR \u201cpsychosis\u201d OR \u201cpsychotic\u201d OR \u201cfirst episode psychosis\u201d OR \u201cFEP\u201d, (2) \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d, and (3) \u201cmonetary incentive delay task\u201d OR \u201cMID\u201d. We also manually examined the reference lists of the selected articles and relevant review articles to include more relevant studies. For studies without available coordinates at the whole-brain level, we asked the authors whether they could provide such information. Details of the literature search and selection were reported in Fig.  .    Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.  \nOf 548 articles initially identified, a total of 17 studies were enrolled for the reward anticipation meta-analysis, and 10 studies were enrolled for the final reward outcome meta-analysis. MID monetary incentive delay, fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging, ROI regions of interest, VOI volume of interest. \n  \n\nStudies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) articles that included patients (aged >18 years) diagnosed with SZ, schizoaffective disorder, or another psychosis spectrum disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) diagnostic criteria; (2) articles that investigated brain functional activity at the whole-brain level between adult SZ patients and HC; (3) articles that used a standardized MID task or modified MID task; (4) articles that examined neuronal activity related to the MID task using fMRI; (5) articles that identified foci of task-related neural changes in anticipation phase and\/or outcome phase; and 6) articles that reported significant results as 3\u00adD coordinates in either the Talairach Atlas (Tal) or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. \n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) case reports, book chapters, reviews, or meta-analyses; (2) non-English articles; (3) studies that included only ROI or volume of interest (VOI) findings; and (4) studies in which the coordinates were not available in the article or after contacting the authors. Six fMRI studies did not provide group differences between SZ and HC and were thus not included in our meta-analysis [ ,  \u2013 ]. Of four studies using overlapping samples [ ,  \u2013 ], the one with more subjects [ ] and the most recent study [ ] were included. One study was excluded because the SZ patients had comorbid Parkinson\u2019s disease [ ]. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nData extraction was independently performed and checked by two authors. The following data were extracted: the sample sizes, the mean age, the percentage of males, the duration of illness, the severity of symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Total (PANSS-T), PANSS-Positive (PANSS-P), PANSS-Negative (PANSS-N)), the proportion of SZ who had ever received first-generation antipsychotics (% (percentage) of FGA users)\/ second-generation antipsychotics (% of SGA users), and methodological items. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of relevant studies \n  \nMID-related activation differences were analyzed using SDM (version 5.15,  ), a novel voxel-based meta-analytic approach that uses the reported peak coordinates to recreate maps depicting the effect size of group differences in functional activations. Peak coordinates were recreated by first converting the peak   t   value to Hedges\u2019 effect size and then applying a normalized Gaussian kernel to the voxels close to the peak. In addition to evaluating the probability of a peak, SDM can be used to recreate maps of the signed (i.e., positive and negative) functional activation or differences between patients and HC by using the reported peak coordinates, which makes SDM an optimal method for comparing patients and controls without biasing the results [ ]. The statistical maps are created by calculating the corresponding statistics from the study maps and weighted by the squared root of the sample size of each study, amplifying the contributions of studies with larger sample sizes [ ]. \n\nThe SDM has more advantages than other methods, such as the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. First, instead of computing coordinates of increased and decreased activation separately, SDM can reconstruct both positive and negative differences in the same map [ ]. Second, studies reporting no group differences can also be included. To date, SDM has been widely applied in previous meta-analyses of structural and functional MRI studies [ \u2013 ]. \n\nWe closely followed the steps taken in the published literatures [ ,  ]. In brief, peak coordinates of group differences and corresponding statistics were extracted from the included articles and then input into SDM software. Measurements (  z   scores and   p   values) were converted into   t   values in advance. Standard MNI maps of the activation differences were created using a Gaussian kernel, and the mean map was calculated representing the weighted mean functional differences during the MID task. Statistical significance was assessed by permutation testing. The default kernel size and statistical thresholds (full width at half maximum [FWHM]\u2009=\u200920\u2009mm,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005, peak height threshold\u2009=\u20091, extent threshold\u2009=\u200910) were used to balance sensitivity and specificity [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn addition, to assess the robustness of the findings, complementary analyses were performed, including jackknife sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses. Based on the results of meta-regression, we also conducted moderation analyses using a standard model [ ,  ] (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### MID-related brain activation differences between SZ and HC during reward anticipation \n  \n#### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nSeventeen studies with 368 SZ and 428 HC were included in the comparison of SZ and HC during reward anticipation [ \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  \u2013 ] (Table   and Fig.  ). The mean age between SZ (32.10 years) and HC (32.36 years) was not significantly different (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.524,   p  \u2009=\u20090.199). The percentage of males among SZ patients (75.00% male) and controls (70.01% male) was also not significantly different (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20092.382,   p  \u2009=\u20090.123).   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis. \n  \n No  . number,   ICD-10   international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th Edition   DSM-IV   diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th Edition,   SZ   schizophrenia,   FEP   first episode psychosis,   HC   healthy controls,   SGA   second-generation antipsychotics,   FGA   first-generation antipsychotics,   Y   yes,   N   no. \n  \n\n\n#### Main meta-analysis \n  \nIn the pooled meta-analysis of reward anticipation, relative to HC, SZ exhibited lower activations in the striatum (with extension to the insula and amygdala), ACC, median cingulate cortex (MCC), right precentral gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in response to monetary stimuli. No brain regions showed increased activation in SZ patients compared to HC (Table   and Fig.  ).   \nResults of the meta-analysis for brain activation difference between SZ and HC during reward anticipation stage. \n  \nResults were threshold at   p  \u2009=\u20090.005, peak height threshold of 1, extent threshold of 10. \n\n BA   Brodmann area,   P   patients,   HC   healthy controls,   ACC   anterior cingulate cortex,   MCC   median cingulate cortex,   STG   superior temporal gyrus,   SDM   seed-based d mapping,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute. \n     Task-evoked activation differences between SZ and HC during reward anticipation and reward outcome.  \n A   For the main analysis of the anticipation stage, SZ patients showed hypoactivation occurring in the bilateral striatum, ACC, MCC, amygdala, right precentral gyrus, and right STG, compared with HC.

The results in the right precentral gyrus and right STG maintained significance in all but two combinations. \n\n\n#### Subgroup analyses \n  \nTo control for any possible differences observed between studies, subgroup analyses were repeated several times to include only those studies that were clinically and methodologically homogenous. Therefore, we conducted subgroup analysis for those studies only including chronic SZ, for those including SZ patients diagnosed by DSM, for those including SZ patients receiving medication treatment, for those using a 3-T MRI scanner, for those using SPM software, and for those reporting coordinates corrected for comparisons. The subgroup analysis revealed that all of the aforementioned results were highly replicable, except for decreased activation in the right precentral gyrus and right STG (Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n#### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nWe next tested correlations between anticipation-evoked activations and demographic and clinical variables, including the mean age, the percentage of males, the duration of illness, the symptom severity and the medication variables. There were no significant correlations between brain MID-related activations and mean age (available in 17 studies), between brain MID-related activations and percentage of males (available in 17 studies), between brain MID-related activations and duration of illness (available in 12 studies), between brain MID-related activations and PANSS-P (available in 14 studies), and between brain MID-related activations and the % of FGA users (available in 17 studies) during reward anticipation. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the severity of negative symptoms (available in 15 studies) was negatively associated with anticipation-evoked hypoactivation in the VS (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u200916,   y  \u2009=\u200914,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u22126,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.507,   p  \u2009=\u20090.038). In addition, the % of SGA users (available in 17 studies) was positively related to the VS activation (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u200916, y\u2009=\u20092, z\u2009=\u20090,   r  \u2009=\u20090.533,   p  \u2009=\u20090.019) (Fig.  ).    Correlations and moderation analyses between clinical symptoms and brain activity during reward anticipation and reward outcome.  \n A   Scatter plot showing a significant negative association between anticipation-evoked activity and negative symptom severity (PANSS-N) in the VS (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u200916,   y  \u2009=\u200914,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u22126,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.507,   p  \u2009=\u20090.038).   B   Scatter plot showing a significant positive association between anticipation-evoked activity and the % (percentage) of SGA users (the proportion of SZ who had ever received SGA) in the VS (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u200916,   y  \u2009=\u20092,   z  \u2009=\u20090,   r  \u2009=\u20090.533,   p  \u2009=\u20090.019).   C   Conceptual diagram of the moderating effect of the % of SGA users on the relationship between negative symptoms and striatum hypoactivation during reward anticipation.   D   Scatter plot showing a significant negative association between outcome-evoked activity and the positive symptom severity (PANSS-P) in the mPFC (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u200946,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221210,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.681,   p  \u2009=\u20090.043).   E   Scatter plot showing a significant positive association between outcome-evoked activity and the % of SGA users in the mPFC (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u200946,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221210,   r  \u2009=\u20090.656,   p  \u2009=\u20090.028).   F   Conceptual diagram of the moderating effect of % of SGA users on the relationship between positive symptoms and mPFC hypoactivation during reward outcome. SZ schizophrenia, HC healthy controls, SGA second-generation antipsychotic, mPFC medial prefrontal cortex. \n  \n\n\n#### Moderation analyses \n  \nSince the negative symptom severity was significantly negatively related to striatum hypoactivation (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.507,   p  \u2009=\u20090.038), we further tested whether the symptom-brain association was dependent on a third variable (including the age, the sex and the medication) through the moderation analysis. Our moderation analysis revealed that the interactions of brain \u00d7 age and brain \u00d7 sex were not statistically significant. In the test of the moderation effect of medication, the interaction of the % of SGA users and negative symptoms significantly improved model fit, suggesting a moderating effect of the % of SGA users on the relationship between negative symptom severity and VS activity (  R   change\u2009=\u20090.263,   B  \u2009=\u20090.173,   p  \u2009=\u20090.019). That is, for individuals in the lower SGA group, a higher PANSS-N score was associated with more decreased striatum activation, while for individuals in the higher SGA group, negative symptoms presented a null association with striatum activity (Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n\n### MID-related brain activation differences between SZ and HC during reward outcome \n  \n#### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nRegarding the reward outcome stage, a total of ten studies comprising 229 SZ and 281 HC met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ] (Table   and Fig.  ). The mean age between SZ (33.84 years) and HC (32.41 years) was not significantly different (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.539,   p  \u2009=\u20090.596). There was no significant difference (  \u03c7  \u2009=\u20090.601,   p  \u2009=\u20090.438) in the percentage of males between SZ patients (67.60% male) and controls (64.59% male). \n\n\n#### Main meta-analysis \n  \nCompared with HC, SZ showed higher activations in the bilateral striatum (with extension to the bilateral insula, amygdala, and hippocampus), left cerebellum, right parahippocampal gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and right MCC during the outcome stage. Significant lower activations in SZ patients were detected in the mPFC and bilateral DLPFC compared to HC (Table   and Fig.  ).   \nResults of the meta-analysis for brain activation difference between SZ and HC during reward outcome stage. \n  \nResults were threshold at   p  \u2009=\u20090.005, peak height threshold of 1, extent threshold of 10. \n\n BA   Brodmann area;   P   patients;   HC   healthy controls,   MCC   median cingulate cortex,   mPFC   medial prefrontal cortex,   DLPFC   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,   SDM   seed-based d mapping,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute. \n  \n\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that the findings in the left striatum, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus were consistent in all combinations of studies. The increased activations in the right striatum left cerebellum and right MCC, as well as reduced activations in the mPFC and DLPFC, remained significant except for one combination (Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n#### Subgroup analyses \n  \nSimilarly, we conducted subgroup analyses for those studies only including chronic SZ, for those including SZ patients diagnosed by DSM, for those including SZ patients receiving medication treatment, for those using a 3-T MRI scanner, for those using SPM software, and for those reporting coordinates corrected for comparisons. The results remained largely unchanged in all of the subgroup analyses (Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n#### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nFor reward outcome, the effect of duration of illness could not be examined due to insufficient data (available in six studies). No significant correlations were found between outcome-evoked activations and several variables (the percentage of males (available in 10 studies), the % of FGA users (available in 10 studies), and the PANSS-N scores (available in eight studies)). Hypoactivation in left mPFC was found to be negatively associated with the PANSS-P scores (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u200946,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221210,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.681,   p  \u2009=\u20090.043; available in eight studies). Moreover, the % of SGA users was found to be positively related to the left mPFC activation (MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u20090,   y  \u2009=\u200946,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u221210,   r  \u2009=\u20090.656,   p  \u2009=\u20090.028; available in 10 studies) (Fig.  ). \n\n\n#### Moderation analyses \n  \nDuring reward outcome, a similar pattern of findings emerged for the moderating effect of % of SGA users. In detail, the interaction of SGA and positive symptoms was a significant predictor of mPFC activity (  R   change\u2009=\u20090.457,   B  \u2009=\u20090.230,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001). A higher PANSS-P was associated with more decreased mPFC activation among participants in the lower SGA group, whereas among participants in the higher SGA group, PANSS-P scores had a null association with mPFC activity (Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur whole-brain meta-analysis of fMRI studies stressed the importance of examining the temporal phases (i.e., anticipation and outcome) of reward processing separately, as we showed dissociable neural substrates during reward anticipation and receipt. During reward anticipation, individuals with SZ showed a reduced response to reward in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry involving the striatum, insula, ACC, MCC, amygdala, right precentral gyrus, and right STG. In contrast, during reward outcome, individuals with SZ showed increased activation in the striatal-limbic circuitry involving the bilateral striatum, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left cerebellum, right postcentral gyrus, right MCC, and decreased activation in the mPFC and DLPFC when processing incentive feedback. In addition, anticipation-evoked activation reductions in the VS were negatively correlated with negative symptoms of SZ, whereas outcome-evoked activation reductions in the mPFC were negatively correlated with positive symptoms of SZ. The relationship between symptom severity and brain activity was moderated by the % of SGA users. This meta-analysis provided evidence that different brain regions in SZ patients are implicated in reward anticipation and reward outcome during the MID task. \n\n### Anticipation-evoked brain responses in SZ \n  \nDuring anticipation, we found that SZ patients exhibited reduced activation in the mesocorticolimbic reward system in response to monetary incentives. Dopamine neurons in the midbrain project widely to the cortex and subcortical structures, including the VS, dorsal striatum, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus. These dopaminergic pathways play an important role in the modulation of motivational processing and decision-making, and changes in dopamine metabolism are thus considered as the central basis for the impairment of \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d -related physiology in SZ. \u201cWanting\u201d refers to the motivational processing of the incentive salience attributed to the reward and is mediated by larger systems that encompass mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic transmission [ ]. Generally, increases in dopaminergic transmission are associated with increases in motivated behavior, whereas disruption of dopaminergic functioning, through focal lesions or pharmacologically induced receptor antagonism\/depletion, reduces motivated behavior [ ]. VS response during reward anticipation has been previously shown to be attenuated in drug-naive patients, patients with chronic SZ, and individuals at high risk for psychosis [ ,  ,  ]. Moreover, the degree of reduced reward anticipation is linked to symptom severity [ ]. Thus, our findings of reduced striatal activity in SZ when anticipating a monetary reward, likely reflect a blunted attribution of motivational salience to monetary stimuli. \n\nReward anticipation is also associated with the deactivations of the ACC and insula region, as proposed by the aberrant salience hypothesis [ ,  ]. Aberrant salience refers to an abnormally reduced response to a reward or related stimuli but a heightened response to neutral or irrelevant stimuli. The salience network (SN) which mainly comprises the ACC and insula, is thought to cause such aberrant salience attribution [ ]. The ACC has extensive connections with a set of other limbic and related areas including the amygdala, OFC, and STG, and is involved in reward-related processing by encoding reward outcomes and determining the effort required to obtain rewards [ ]. The insular cortex has emerged in the last few years as a key region in SZ research and is considered to be a crucial relay center of interoceptive signals that integrates with exteroceptive awareness [ ]. A previous major depressive disorder (MDD) study showed that the functional activity and functional connectivity (FC) of the insula were important indicators of electroconvulsive therapy [ ]. Several SZ studies have reported the reduced gray matter and\/or functional activity and FC within the insula\u2013ACC SN [ ,  ]. Palaniyappan and colleagues have proposed that dysfunction of the insula\u2013ACC SN is linked to the psychotic symptoms of SZ by inappropriately allocating salience to irrelevant internal or external stimuli [ ]. Reduced FC within brain regions involving the ACC and insula was proven to be associated with heightened affective and anxiety symptoms and an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. Incentive valence, behavioral relevance, or expectancy violation would determine the processing the stimulus salience of momentary reward and lead to a change in the brain state [ ,  ]. Therefore, abnormalities in the mesolimbic system and the cortical SN detected when individuals are performing the MID task may help explain abnormal reinforcer processing and symptoms, which appears to be a prominent characteristic of the pathophysiology of SZ. \n\nBlunted activations in the right STG and precentral gyrus of SZ patients in response to monetary stimuli were also found during anticipation. Decreased gray matter volume and changed functional activation and FC in the STG have been robustly implicated in the neurophysiology of SZ [ \u2013 ]. Pertinently, the STG plays a key role in language perception, which is consistent with previous reports linking this region with auditory hallucinations in SZ [ ]. However, the temporal area is sensitive to socially relevant information and may also be linked to incentive salience processing [ ]. The precentral gyrus has also been associated with behavioral responses to motivationally significant events [ ]. Abnormally reduced reward-related activity in the precentral gyrus and STG in SZ would imply a reduction in salience to rewarding events, as well as motivated goal-directed behavior by associations with reinforcing events. \n\n\n### Outcome-evoked responses in SZ \n  \nIn contrast, at the reward outcome stage, SZ showed elevated activations in the striatal-limbic circuitry, including the bilateral VS, amygdala, insula, hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left cerebellum, right postcentral gyrus, and right MCC, and diminished activations in the mPFC and DLPFC. Impaired neural processing during reward outcome may be independent from motivational components given that hedonic impact was found to be independent from anticipation effects. Our meta-analysis revealed that SZ showed stronger activation in the VS during the receipt of a reward, perhaps indicating an elevated reactivity to rewarding outcomes. Consistent with our findings, past research reported that striatal activation is associated with reward outcome and that SZ patients reveal higher striatum signals during the outcome phase [ ]. Furthermore, animal studies supported the involvement of the VS in the experience of pleasure and hedonic perception of rewards [ ]. As part of the limbic structures, the VS, amygdala, and insula are thought to play a significant role in guiding behavior and facilitating learning. A growing body of evidence suggests that the amygdala is critical for feedback-guided learning behavior, and VS reflects the encoding of expected value of outcome and action selection for the obtainment of rewards [ ,  ], whereas the parahippocampal gyrus is related to prediction errors [ ,  ]. A similar pattern of activation within limbic regions has been reported during the receipt of a reward [ ,  ,  ]. Regarding the preferential involvement of the limbic-striatal areas in hedonic processes, the findings of over-responsiveness to rewarding outcome may reflect the presumed motivational significance of hedonic experience underlying the reward-seeking behavior. \n\nOutcome-related increased activity was also present in the cerebellum in SZ patients. Evidence indicates that the cerebellum plays a role in higher cortical functions, such as emotional processing and social cognition [ ,  ]. It has been proposed that the cerebellum encodes error signals and participates in feedback-based learning. Recent findings of altered error processing in patients with cerebellar lesions confirmed the hypothesis that feedback processing might be affected by cerebellar damage [ ,  ]. Notably, cerebellar dysfunction and hyperconnectivity patterns in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit have been consistently observed in SZ [ \u2013 ]. Our finding of exaggerated cerebellar activation in the reward reception phase appears to reflect the importance of cerebellum in controlling the reward process in psychosis. \n\nReduced activation in response to reward was observed in the DLPFC and mPFC during the outcome. Pertinently, the prefrontal cortex is a heterogeneous area that is critical to reward-based decision-making. Studies have demonstrated that the DLPFC is implicated in higher-order cognitive control, especially for reward values and effort calculations [ ,  ], whereas the mPFC is a key node for emotion-related reward processes and value-based decision-making through interactions with the VS and amygdala [ ,  ]. Furthermore, reduced FC in medial prefrontal-striatal network is related to disrupted cognitive control and reward processing [ ]. Promoting local, long-range, and dynamic connectivity within the frontal areas could effectively improve cognitive function [ ]. Because the PFC exerts top-down control over striatal dopamine-induced activity and drives synchrony between specific corticolimbic circuit regions [ ], we speculated that reduced cortical excitability in the prefrontal region might trigger elevated striatal and limbic responses. \n\n\n### Correlations between clinical symptoms and brain activity at different reward stages \n  \nDuring reward anticipation, the meta-regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between VS hypoactivation and the severity of negative symptoms. In line with this, a strong association of reduced VS activation during reward anticipation with negative symptoms was observed in previous studies [ ,  ]. As the activity of this region mediates incentive motivation or wanting of reward, this result may suggest that impaired striatal activity is involved in the pathophysiology of motivational deficits in SZ patients. A similar result was observed in our meta-analysis in the association with current antipsychotic drug use. Specifically, we found that VS hypoactivation was positively associated with the % of SGA users. Consistent with this finding, Juckel and colleagues reported an improvement in reduced VS activity in patients taking SGA but not in those taking FGA or those who were unmedicated [ ]. Since SGA has less blockade of striatal D  receptors, it may enhance the treatment of negative symptoms and maintain motivation to reach potential rewards owing to less blockade of striatal D  receptors [ ]. In this regard, the linkages between blunted striatal anticipating function and negative symptoms would help to explain the different facets of reward processing in the correlation of behavioral disturbances. \n\nDuring reward outcome, our meta-regression analysis further revealed that reward-related hypoactivity in the mPFC was negatively associated with positive symptoms. Dysfunction in the mPFC may result in hallucinations and delusions [ ]. Several postmortem and fMRI studies have provided evidence for abnormal anatomical and FC of the mPFC, which is implicated in psychiatric symptoms and impaired cognitive function in SZ and MDD patients [ ,  ]. For example, previous studies found that hyperconnectivity between the mPFC and default mode network was correlated with more serious positive symptoms in SZ patients [ ]. Along similar lines, an association between disrupted error feedback in the mPFC and delusion severity was observed [ ]. Our study also found that mPFC activation was positively associated with the % of SGA users during the outcome phase. As mentioned above, SGA administration could improve the dysfunction of the PFC and positive symptoms. Our meta-regression results suggested that the neural processing of reward outcomes in the mPFC may be related to the pathophysiology of positive symptoms in SZ patients. Notably, although the regression analysis results during reward outcome are statistically significant, they are preliminary and require future research to obtain a better understanding of their effects. \n\nOur exploratory moderation analyses revealed that SGA use was a significant moderator of the symptom-brain relationship during reward anticipation and outcome: results were negative in patients taking fewer SGAs and null in patients taking more SGAs. In patients in the group taking more SGA, negative symptoms presented a null association with brain activity. It is well documented that SGA is presumed to act as a treatment for negative symptoms [ ] and multiple neuroprotective effects on the brain [ ]. It is likely that SGA affect symptoms and the brain simultaneously, and thereby reduces and weakens the link between symptoms and brain activity in patients taking more SGA; On the other hand, in patients taking fewer SGA, the symptoms were inversely related to brain activity. In accordance, previous reports show that the more serious negative symptoms are, the stronger the reduction in striatal activation under the condition that patients took fewer SGA [ ,  ]. Moreover, the striatal activation reduction was inversely correlated with the severity of negative symptoms in patients being not treated with SGA [ ]. A recent European Psychiatric Association guidance paper argued SGA (i.e., amisulpride) has certain potential in the treatment of negative symptoms and suggested that a switch to SGA should be considered for patients who are treated with FGA [ ]. additionally, a randomized controlled trial revealed that SGA showed statistically significant effects on negative symptoms [ ]. In the present study, we present preliminary evidence for a moderating role of SGA in the relationship between clinical symptoms and brain activity. The symptom-brain relationship is complex, and further studies of how this relationship changes as modulation of antipsychotic treatment need to be validated in controlled clinical trials. \n\n\n### The heterogeneity in the subgroup analyses of anticipation stage \n  \nNotably, the results showed that the brain activity in the right STG did not survive in the subgroup analyses for studies including chronic SZ patients and studies including SZ patients receiving medication treatment. The medial-temporal lobe, including the STG, is probably the most extensively investigated brain structure in SZ. STG is believed to be a major anatomical substrate for auditory hallucinations and thought disorders in SZ [ ]. Although STG abnormalities have been well demonstrated in SZ, some studies have reported negative results for STG abnormalities [ ,  ,  ]. A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry in SZ reported that 6 of 15 studies showed no significant brain volume difference in the STG when compared with controls [ ]. Furthermore, an attenuated response in the STG during the anticipation of monetary incentives has been found in medication-free SZ patients but not in medicated patients [ ,  ]. It is well known that SZ is a chronic psychiatric disorder that can be effectively controlled but likely requires lifelong treatment. Previous neuroimaging studies of SZ examined chronically ill patients, for whom findings are potentially influenced by disease course and medication. Exposure to antipsychotic drugs may have an effect on brain structure and function [ \u2013 ]. For example, increased cortical thickness and increased anticipation-related brain activity in the STG over treatment time have been observed, which is associated with symptomatic improvement [ ,  ]. Importantly, it has been suggested that the improvement of positive symptoms was significantly associated with the normalization of reward-related activation [ ]. SZ patients who show a long illness duration may also experience a neurotoxic effect on their brain structure and function [ ,  ]. Furthermore, the STG can be cytoarchitectonically and functionally divided into several subdivisions [ ]. The complexity and heterogeneity of the STG may account for the inconsistency. \n\nIn addition, our current subgroup analysis of studies that applied a 3-T MRI scanner also found that STG activity showed some heterogeneity. Different studies used different MRI scanners with different MRI field strengths, which could introduce potential bias. One possible explanation for this is that in a high-strength field, echo planar imaging results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio but also increases susceptibility artifacts [ ]. In particular, it is influenced in regions with susceptibility artifacts, especially for imaging the temporal lobes [ ]. Future studies should investigate the influence of different magnetic strengths on imaging presentation, and meta-analyses with homogeneous magnetic field strength are needed to confirm this finding. \n\n\n### Clinical implications \n  \nThe biological markers of different stages of reward processing may help elucidate the complex and multifaceted symptoms as well as neurobehavioral disruptions observed in SZ patients. Dysfunction in reward processing is regarded in the DSM-5 as a key factor in the anhedonic symptoms of SZ [ ]. Previous studies found that SZ patients have impaired motivation to pursue rewards and reduced activation in the reward pathway during the presentation of reward stimuli, although pleasure in consuming rewards is largely intact [ ]. Deficits in any reward component, including reward valuation, reward expectancy, and action selection, may preclude an individual from engaging in goal-directed actions for rewards, regardless of whether the reward is perceived as pleasurable once obtained. In other words, the construct of anhedonia that reflects deficits in hedonic capacity is closely linked to the constructs of reward anticipation, valuation, and motivation. In our meta-analysis, we found that anticipation and outcome stages of reward may recruit distinct activation patterns, and these patterns are correlated with different clinical symptoms. As SZ is linked to changes in reward processing, probing distinct neural processes of the reward system may help improve the present understanding of the role of different aspects of reward system in the pathogenesis of SZ. \n\nDistinguishing the reward anticipation and outcome phases may also reveal a biomarker that can be used to predict treatment outcomes. A recent study with healthy human volunteers provided pharmacological evidence that the effort to obtain a reward and the related facial reactions during reward anticipation are modulated by the administration of dopaminergic antagonists [ ]. Another study observed that reward anticipation activity, but not reward outcome activity, was significantly associated with an antidepressant response in individuals with major depression disorder [ ]. The authors also observed that the frontostriatal connectivity during reward anticipation was significantly correlated with a reduction in depressive symptoms [ ]. Consistent with these findings, SGA influences VS activation during anticipation and mPFC activation during the delivery of a monetary reward in SZ. Interestingly, our findings showed dissociated neurobiological mechanisms in different aspects of reward processing, and have the potential to clarify the complex brain-behavior relationships in SZ. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. First, publication bias is almost inevitable, although we conducted a comprehensive literature search [ ]. Second, the correlation between outcome-evoked activation and other clinical variables, such as the duration of illness, was not investigated because of insufficient data. Third, we cannot rule out the potential influence of medication, the stage of illness and several methodological factors on our results. Medication history or stages of disease varied in the included samples, which leads to the heterogeneity of brain activity during the reward anticipation phase. Future longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the effects of both medication and the stage of disease on neural dysfunctions in reward processing. In addition, the included articles used different MRI scanners with different MRI field strengths, which may lead to methodological heterogeneity and potentially limit our ability to detect robust group differences. Fourth, we included only studies on adult patients in our analysis, and the generalizability of our findings in children\/adolescents needs to be further tested. Finally, since computational approaches are useful to reveal hidden psychological states subtending motivation and experienced pleasure, a systematic investigation of complex learning components may help to clarify these hidden states. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present study examined neural mechanisms underlying different phases of reward processing in SZ patients and their relevance to clinical symptomology. Patients with SZ showed hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuit during reward anticipation and elevated activation in the striatal-limbic circuitry but reduced responses in the DLPFC and mPFC were elicited by monetary outcomes. Anticipation-evoked VS hypoactivation was linked to negative symptoms, and outcome-evoked mPFC activation was linked to positive symptoms. Our findings showed dissociated neurobiological mechanisms in different aspects of reward processing and have the potential to clarify the complex brain-behavior relationships in SZ. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9573872,"text_md5":"3a9ad264ed4fde9fdf0713197c9f41ce","field_positions":{"authors":[0,105],"journal":[106,123],"publication_year":[125,129],"title":[140,280],"keywords":[294,321],"abstract":[334,2122],"body":[2131,47397]},"batch":2,"pmid":36244990,"doi":"10.1038\/s41398-022-02201-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9573872","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9573872"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9573872\">9573872<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9573872  Neural substrates of reward anticipation and outcome in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of fMRI findings in the monetary incentive delay task"}
{"text":"Kim, M Justin and Knodt, Annchen R and Hariri, Ahmad R\nSoc Cogn Affect Neurosci, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nMeta-analytic activation maps can help identify affective processes captured by contrast-based task fMRI: the case of threat-related facial expressions\n\n# Keywords\n\nfMRI\nmeta-analysis map\nemotion\nfear\nanger\nfacial expression\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nMeta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is an effective method for capturing the distributed patterns of brain activity supporting discrete cognitive and affective processes. One opportunity presented by the resulting meta-analysis maps (MAMs) is as a reference for better understanding the nature of individual contrast maps (ICMs) derived from specific task fMRI data. Here, we compared MAMs from 148 neuroimaging studies representing emotion categories of fear, anger, disgust, happiness and sadness with ICMs from fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral faces from an independent dataset of task fMRI (  n  \u2009=\u20091263). Analyses revealed that both fear and anger ICMs exhibited the greatest pattern similarity to fear MAMs. As the number of voxels included for the computation of pattern similarity became more selective, the specificity of MAM\u2013ICM correspondence decreased. Notably, amygdala activity long considered critical for processing threat-related facial expressions was neither sufficient nor necessary for detecting MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity effects. Our analyses suggest that both fearful and angry facial expressions are best captured by distributed patterns of brain activity, a putative neural correlate of threat. More generally, our analyses demonstrate how MAMs can be leveraged to better understand affective processes captured by ICMs in task fMRI data. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnderstanding how emotions map onto human brain function is a long-standing aim of affective neuroscience. To achieve this goal, affective neuroscientists have heavily employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether different properties of emotion based on existing theories\u2014such as a valence\/arousal dimension ( ) or basic emotion categories ( )\u2014may be reflected in patterns of brain activity. Early fMRI studies that aimed to elucidate the neural representations of categorical emotions focused on the amygdala because of its demonstrated importance in aversive learning as exemplified through the acquisition of a conditioned fear response ( ;  ). However, fMRI studies have yielded mixed results wherein amygdala activity may be elicited by not only threat-related emotions (e.g. fear and anger) but also other categories of emotion (e.g. happiness and sadness) ( ). \n\nIn fact, it has been suggested that amygdala activity alone does not provide a sufficient level of specificity in distinguishing emotion categories ( ). More generally, fMRI studies examining discrete emotion categories have not revealed correspondingly discrete brain regions ( ). In contrast, recent research employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) offers evidence that discrete emotion categories may be best represented by distributed patterns of activity across the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ; but see  ). \n\nA rapidly expanding portfolio of fMRI studies has allowed for a series of computational methods designed to generate voxel-wise meta-analysis maps (MAMs) of brain activity associated with specific cognitive and affective processes ( ;  ;  ). MAMs typically share the same coordinate or stereotaxic space [e.g. Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach] as individual contrast maps (ICMs), which represent subject-level brain activity associated with a study-specific contrast of interest. As such, MAMs could provide a reference map for a given mental process or behavior. For example, ICMs of a typical emotion category, such as fear, should show patterns of brain activity more similar to MAMs of the corresponding category (i.e. fear) than other categories (e.g. disgust or sadness). In other words, if affective information for fear is indeed represented in brain activity for fear ICMs, they should correspond to the associated MAMs for fear. This not only presents a testable prediction but also an opportunity to refine ICMs (through pattern similarity analysis with MAMs) in a fashion that maximizes their ability to capture brain activity supporting a specific mental process. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to test a simple idea: would an ICM of a given emotion category show greater similarity to the MAM of the same category over others? There are at least three conditions that serve as a prerequisite for such an examination: (i) MAMs from voxel-wise meta-analyses of fMRI data, (ii) category-specific ICMs from a study with a sufficiently large sample size and (iii) independence between the MAMs and ICMs\u2014that is, the ICMs selected for testing should not have been used in the generation of the MAMs. Here, we take advantage of datasets that satisfy these conditions. First,   have conducted a computational meta-analysis of 148 functional neuroimaging studies to generate MAMs for five emotion categories: fear, anger, disgust, happiness and sadness. Second, the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS) offers a large independent dataset (  n\u2009  =\u20091263) of ICMs for fear, anger, surprise and neutral emotions from a widely utilized face-matching task. Importantly, none of the ICMs from the DNS were included in the generation of MAMs. \n\nAlso of importance is considering neural representations of emotion in the context of experience   vs   perception. Measuring brain activity when a person is experiencing (i.e. feeling) anger may not necessarily be the same as when they are perceiving (i.e. looking at) angry facial expressions of others. Affective neuroscience suggests the experience and perception of emotions yield both shared and distinct neural correlates (see  ;   for meta-analysis and review). It is worth noting then that the ICMs we use in the present analyses represent correlates of the perception of emotional facial expressions, whereas the MAMs were computed from fMRI data derived from both the experience and perception of emotions (see   of   for details). Taking these differences into account may be key to understanding the present MAM\u2013ICM associations. \n\nBased on the existing literature, we hypothesized that ICMs for fear and anger would show the greatest pattern similarity to MAMs for fear and anger, respectively. Moreover, we sought to examine the possibility that affective information pertaining to emotion categories is distributed across the whole brain by systematically varying the number of voxels submitted for pattern similarity analysis. Finally, given the prominence of the amygdala in the affective neuroscience literature ( ;  ;  ;  ), we tested whether amygdala activity specifically was either sufficient or necessary to produce the MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity observed in whole-brain analyses. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOne thousand two-hundred and sixty-three participants (717 women, 19.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009years of age) successfully completed the DNS between January 2010 and November 2016, including an fMRI task eliciting threat-related brain activity. All participants provided written informed consent according to the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. To be eligible for the DNS, participants were required to be free of the following conditions: (i) medical diagnoses of cancer, stroke, head injury with loss of consciousness, untreated migraine headaches, diabetes requiring insulin treatment, or chronic kidney or liver disease; (ii) use of psychotropic, glucocorticoid or hypolipidemic medication and (iii) conditions affecting cerebral blood flow and metabolism (e.g. hypertension). As DNS followed a standardized procedure, we note that the following description of the methods is also described elsewhere (e.g.  ). \n\n\n### Face-matching task \n  \nThe face-matching task used in the DNS consisted of four task blocks interleaved with five control blocks. A total of four emotion categories were used for each task block: fear (F), anger (A), surprise (S) and neutral (N), taken from a standardized facial expression set ( ). Participants viewed the task blocks in one of four randomly assigned orders as determined by a Latin Square (i.e. FNAS, NFSA, ASFN and SANF). During task blocks, participants viewed a trio of faces that belonged to the same emotional category (e.g. all three faces displayed fearful expressions in fear blocks) and matched one of two faces identical to a target face. Each trial in the task blocks lasted for 4 s with a variable interstimulus interval of 2\u20136 s (mean\u2009=\u20094 s), for a total block length of 48 s. The control blocks consisted of six geometric shape trios, which were presented for 4 s with a fixed interstimulus interval of 2 s for a total block length of 36 s. Each block was preceded by a brief instruction (\u2018Match faces\u2019 or \u2018Match shapes\u2019) lasting 2 s. Total task time was 390 s. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nEach participant was scanned using one of the two identical research-dedicated GE MR750 3T scanner equipped with high-power high-duty-cycle 50-mT\/m gradients at 200\u2009T\/m\/s slew rate and an eight-channel head coil for parallel imaging at high bandwidth up to 1\u2009MHz at the Duke-UNC Brain Imaging and Analysis Center. A semi-automated high-order shimming program was used to ensure global field homogeneity. A series of 34 interleaved axial functional slices aligned with the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane were acquired for full-brain coverage using an inverse-spiral pulse sequence to reduce susceptibility artifacts (repetition time (TR), echo time (TE)\/flip angle\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms\/30\u2009ms\/60; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; 3.75\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm voxels; interslice skip\u2009=\u20090). Four initial radiofrequency excitations were performed (and discarded) to achieve steady-state equilibrium. To allow for spatial registration of each participant\u2019s data to a standard coordinate system, high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted structural images were obtained in 162 axial slices using a 3D Ax FSPGR BRAVO sequence (TR\/TE\/flip angle\u2009=\u20098.148\u2009ms\/3.22\u2009ms\/12\u00b0; voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9375x0.9375x1mm; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; interslice skip\u2009=\u20090; total scan time\u2009=\u20094\u2009min and 13 s). In addition, high-resolution structural images were acquired in 34 axial slices coplanar with the functional scans and used for spatial registration for participants without Ax FSPGR BRAVO images (TR\/TE\/flip angle\u2009=\u20097.7 s\/3.0\u2009ms\/12; voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, interslice skip\u2009=\u20090). \n\n\n### fMRI data preprocessing \n  \nAnatomical images for each subject were skull-stripped, intensity-normalized and non-linearly warped to a study-specific average template in the standard stereotactic space of the MNI template using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ). BOLD time series for each subject were processed in AFNI ( ). Images for each subject were despiked, slice time-corrected, realigned to the first volume in the time series to correct for head motion, coregistered to the anatomical image using FSL\u2019s Boundary Based Registration ( ), spatially normalized into MNI space using the non-linear warp from the anatomical image, resampled to 2\u2009mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed to minimize noise and residual difference in gyral anatomy with a Gaussian filter, set at 6\u2009mm full-width at half-maximum. All transformations were concatenated so that a single interpolation was performed. Voxel-wise signal intensities were scaled to yield a time series mean of 100 for each voxel. Volumes exceeding 0.5\u2009mm framewise displacement (FD) or 2.5 standardized temporal derivative of root mean square (RMS) variance over voxels (DVARS) ( ;  ) were censored. \n\n\n### Individual contrast maps \n  \nThe AFNI program   3dREMLfit   ( ) was used to fit a general linear model for first-level fMRI data analyses. To obtain emotion-specific parameter estimates, we explicitly modeled each respective task block (convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function) along with the adjacent half of the preceding and following control blocks and a first-order polynomial regressor to account for low-frequency noise. This allowed for the estimation of the individual task block parameters while minimizing the influence of adjacent task blocks as well as low-frequency noise across the entire run. The resulting parameter estimates for the fear and anger task blocks and the neutral task blocks were then subtracted to obtain the fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral faces ICMs (henceforth referred to as ICM-F and ICM-A, respectively), and these ICMs were used to compute pattern similarity with the MAMs. The contrast surprise\u2009>\u2009neutral was omitted from the present study, because a corresponding surprise MAM does not exist. ICMs were then used in second-level random-effects models in SPM12 ( ) accounting for scan-to-scan and participant-to-participant variability to determine mean emotion-specific activity using one-sample   t  -tests. A statistical threshold of   P   \u2009  <\u20090.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected across the whole brain was applied to the fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral contrasts, respectively. The ICMs are available by reasonable request, following the data-sharing procedures through our website ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI quality assurance criteria \n  \nQuality control criteria for inclusion of a participant\u2019s imaging data were as follows:\u2009>5 volumes for each condition of interest retained after censoring for FD and DVARS and sufficient temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within the bilateral amygdala, defined as no greater than 3 s.d. below the mean of this value across participants. The amygdala was defined using a high-resolution template generated from the 168 Human Connectome Project datasets ( ). Additionally, data were only included in further analyses if the participant demonstrated sufficient engagement with the task, defined as achieving at least 75% accuracy during the task blocks. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis maps \n  \nThe MAMs utilized in the present study are based on a meta-analysis of 148 fMRI studies of emotional categories ( ). The MAMs were generously made available by these study authors on their website ( ). In brief, the original meta-analysis consisted of five distinct emotion categories (fear, anger, disgust, sadness and happiness), and MAMs for each category were generated in standard MNI space using a hierarchical Bayesian model that summarizes the expected frequency of activation for a given emotion category. The values that each voxel of the MAMs assumes are reflective of this information, such that taking the integral over any area of the brain represents the expected number of activation centers for all studies of a given emotion category ( ). The overall findings indicated that brain activity patterns that are diagnostic of distinct categories of emotion are characterized as widespread (i.e. distributed across not only multiple brain regions but also many neural systems that span cognitive, perceptual and motor functions). For the purposes of the present study, higher-intensity voxel values of the MAMs indicate a greater likelihood with which the MAMs correspond to a given emotion category. Detailed characteristics of the MAMs are described in the original study ( ). In brief, the 148 studies included 377 unique study activation maps; out of those, 97 and 69 maps were used to generate MAMs for fear and anger, respectively. The study activation maps were contrasting an emotion-related condition to a less intense or affectively neutral comparison condition. The majority of the individual studies presented the experimental stimuli visually. For fear and anger MAMs, over half of the studies used faces\/facial expressions in some capacity, followed by pictures, film and words (see   of   for details). Importantly, none of the 148 studies that were included in this meta-analysis overlapped with the DNS, ensuring independence across MAMs and ICMs (the MAMs included studies published from 1993 to 2011; the first study using the ICMs from the emotional face-matching task in the DNS was published in 2012). \n\n\n### MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity computation \n  \nFor quantifying MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity, we adopted a modified version of an approach described by  . First, prior to each analysis, ICMs were masked with the target MAMs, to match the number of non-zero voxels. Then, for each MAM  \u2013  ICM pair, all non-zero voxels were vectorized and demeaned in order to compute their correlation coefficients, which were subsequently converted to   z   scores using Fisher\u2019s   r  -to-  z   transformation ( ). Computation of correlation coefficients across vectorized voxels was achieved with   3ddot   implemented within AFNI ( ). Higher   z   scores indicated greater pattern similarity between a given MAM\u2013ICM pair. Since there were five MAMs, a total of 5   z   scores were computed for each of two ICMs for each participant. As we were primarily interested in how well a given ICM (e.g. ICM-F) aligned with its corresponding MAM (e.g. MAM-F) above and beyond other MAMs, the   z   scores were compared across the MAMs. Two models were generated to test this: (i) a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) where   z   scores for a given ICM and MAMs for each of the five emotion categories were compared and (ii) a paired   t  -test where   z   scores for a given ICM and MAMs for fear and anger, specifically, were compared. The latter model was used to specifically focus on the two emotion categories that were available as both ICMs and MAMs. Analyses were done separately for ICM-F and ICM-A. In this way, we could confirm the a priori prediction that ICM-F would correspond better to the MAM-F, above and beyond the MAMs of other emotion categories; then, the same procedure was applied to test whether ICM-A would show increased pattern similarity to the MAM-A compared to other MAMs. \n  \nSummary of data analysis procedures used for assessing MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity. ICMs for fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral derived from 1263 participants performing an emotional face-matching task were compared with five MAMs corresponding to different categories of emotion from  . For each MAM\u2013ICM pair, all non-zero voxels were vectorized in order to compute their correlation coefficient, which was subsequently converted to   z   scores using Fisher\u2019s   r  -to-  z   transformation. \n  \nTo test whether the number of voxels included in the analyses impacted the results, MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity measures were computed repeatedly using MAMs at different thresholds. The threshold was systematically varied, ranging from unthresholded to 0.1 intensity values, which represents the expected frequency of activation centers for an emotion category, with each step increasing the threshold by 2-fold (i.e. unthresholded\u20130.001\u20130.005\u20130.01\u20130.05\u20130.1). It is notable that there was a general tendency for cortical areas to become reduced as a function of increased MAM threshold, while the amygdala was among the last regions to remain, regardless of emotion category ( ). Effect sizes from the analyses that compared a given ICM across different MAMs (partial \u03b7  for ANOVA, Cohen\u2019s   d   for   t  -test) were used to describe the effect of applying different thresholds on the pattern similarity metrics. \n  \nFive emotion-specific MAMs at systematically varied thresholds. Voxels that survived increasingly stringent thresholds (i.e. the higher intensity values noted on the left-hand side) are depicted by hotter colors. Intensity values indicate the expected frequency of activation centers for an emotion category (see   for details). \n  \nFinally, to test the contribution of amygdala activity specifically on the pattern similarity results from the main analyses, two sets of subsequent analyses were performed on the data. First, each MAM\u2013ICM pair was masked with an anatomical region of interest (ROI) of the amygdala, divided into basolateral and centromedial subregions ( ), which then underwent the same procedure described above using only the amygdala voxels (here, only unthresholded MAM voxels were used). In a separate set of analyses, each MAM\u2013ICM pair was masked with a reversed mask of the anatomical ROI, such that all amygdala voxels were removed from further analysis. Then, the same procedure as the main analyses was repeated for the amygdala-excluded MAM\u2013ICM pairs. The latter analysis tested the prediction that if the amygdala voxels contain important information about distinct emotion categories, then it would yield decreased pattern similarity metrics for corresponding MAM\u2013ICM pairs. To supplement the MAM\u2013ICM findings, the aforementioned analyses were repeated by replacing ICMs with group contrast maps (fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral) derived from second-level random-effects models (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ICMs: fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral \n  \nAcross the entire brain, both ICMs yielded significant activity in the amygdala, supramarginal gyrus\/angular gyrus extending to the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral ICMs also revealed significantly increased activity in the occipital pole and the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Significantly activated amygdala voxel clusters were isolated within the amygdala proper and not a part of a larger cluster that extends to other brain regions ( ,  ). \n  \nGroup-level whole-brain responses from 1263 participants performing an emotional face-matching task (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE-corrected for the whole brain;   k\u2009  \u2265\u200930 are visualized). (A) Brain regions that showed significantly increased activity to fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral included the amygdala, supramarginal gyrus\/angular gyrus\/STS, IFG, inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and the occipital pole. (B) Similar brain regions showed significantly increased activity to angry\u2009>\u2009neutral. \n    \nBrain regions showing significant activation for the contrasts of fearful\u2009>\u2009neutral and angry\u2009>\u2009neutral (  P   \u2009  <\u20090.05, FWE-corrected for the whole brain) \n  \n\n### Whole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for fear \n  \nOverall, there was significant pattern similarity between ICM-F and MAM-F (  M  \u2009=\u20090.0065, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.03, [min, max]\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.11, 0.11]; one-sample   t  -test:   t  \u2009=\u20097.57,   P   \u2009  <\u20090.000001,   d  \u2009=\u20090.21). This effect remained significant when the MAMs were thresholded at varying levels (all   P  s\u2009<\u20090.002), except for one instance (ICM-F and MAM-F pair thesholded at 0.1;   P  \u2009=\u20090.16). \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVA showed significant differences of MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for ICM-F across the five MAMs (  F  \u2009=\u200917.27,   P  \u2009<\u20090.000001; \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.014).   Post hoc   analysis revealed that pattern similarity for MAM-F was significantly greater than the other four MAMs (all   P  s\u2009<\u20090.002). This finding remained when the threshold was increased to 0.01 (i.e. less voxels were selected); however, this effect was no longer observable when the threshold was further increased. Paired   t  -tests showed similar findings as the ANOVA, such that pattern similarity between ICM-F and MAM-F was significantly greater than MAM-A (  t  \u2009=\u20093.3,   P   \u2009  =\u20090.001;   d\u2009  =\u20090.09). Again, this effect was observable until the threshold was increased to 0.01. When the threshold was set to the highest level (0.1), an unexpected opposite effect was found such that pattern similarity between ICM-F and MAM-F was significantly less than for ICM-F and MAM-A (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.65,   P   \u2009  =\u20090.008;   d\u2009  =\u20090.1). \n\nEffect sizes of the ANOVA and   t  -test results gradually decreased as a function of increased threshold levels. As ICM-F showed the highest level of pattern similarity to MAM-F over other MAMs, diminishing effect sizes suggest a relative decrease in the specificity of ICM-F to MAM-F. These findings are summarized in   (white bars and circles). \n  \nWhole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for fear and anger. (A) Pattern similarity measures of ICM-F (blue) and ICM-A (red) to each of the five MAMs, summarized by varying threshold levels. Overall, both fear ICMs showed greater pattern similarity with the fear MAM, but this effect disappeared when the threshold was sufficiently high (e.g. 0.1). (B) Plotting the effect sizes from repeated-measures ANOVA showed a gradually declining trend as a function of increased threshold levels. (C) A similar trend was found when the effect sizes from paired   t  -tests were plotted. \n  \n\n### Whole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for anger \n  \nAgain, there was significant pattern similarity between ICM-A and MAM-A (  M  \u2009=\u20090.0036, s.d.\u2009=\u20090.02, [min, max]\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.06, 0.06]; one-sample   t  -test:   t  \u2009=\u20096.71,   P   \u2009  <\u20090.000001,   d  \u2009=\u20090.19). This effect persisted regardless of differences in the thresholds applied to the MAMs. \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVA showed significant differences of MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for ICM-A across the five MAMs (  F  \u2009=\u200911.46,   P  \u2009<\u20090.000001; \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.009).   Post hoc   analysis revealed, however, that ICM-A showed greatest pattern similarity to MAM-F compared to the other four MAMs, including anger (all   P  s\u2009<\u20090.03). This finding remained when the threshold was increased to 0.05 (i.e. less voxels were selected); however, this effect was no longer observable when the threshold was increased to 0.1. Paired   t  -tests showed similar findings as the ANOVA, such that pattern similarity between ICM-A and MAM-A was significantly less than for ICM-A and MAM-F (  t  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.2,   P  \u2009=\u20090.028,   d\u2009  =\u20090.06). Again, this effect was observable up until the threshold was increased to 0.05. When the threshold was set to the highest level (0.1), this effect was no longer present. \n\nEffect sizes of the ANOVA results gradually decreased as a function of increased threshold levels. Effect sizes of the   t  -tests showed a less clear but consistent pattern where the highest threshold (0.1) yielded the smallest effect size. However, as ICM-A showed the highest pattern similarity to MAM-F and not MAM-A, diminishing effect sizes indicate a relative decrease in the specificity of ICM-A to MAM-F. These findings are summarized in   (gray bars and circles). \n\n\n### Amygdala MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for fear and anger \n  \nRepeated-measures ANOVA showed significant differences in pattern similarity in amygdala activity between ICM-F and all five MAMs (  F  \u2009=\u20092.86,   P  \u2009=\u20090.022; \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.002). However,   post hoc   analysis showed that this effect was driven by an unexpected pattern similarity between ICM-F and the MAM for happiness. This finding remained the same when the analysis was restricted to basolateral or centromedial subregions of the amygdala. Paired   t  -tests showed similar findings as the ANOVA, such that the pattern similarity between ICM-F and MAM-F was no different from those for MAM-A. Again, this effect remained the same for basolateral or centromedial subregions of the amygdala. \n\nSimilarly, amygdala activity from ICM-A significantly differed from all five MAMs (  F  \u2009=\u20094.07,   P  \u2009=\u20090.003; \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.003), but the happiness MAM showed the greatest degree of pattern similarity to ICM-A. This effect remained when only the basolateral or centromedial amygdala voxels were considered in the analysis. Once again, pairwise comparison between MAM-F and MAM-A yielded no significant differences in overall or subregional amygdala activity. \n\nThe very small effect sizes of the ANOVA and   t  -test results of the amygdala analyses showed that they were comparable to the whole-brain analyses using the highest threshold levels and not useful in parsing the distinct emotion categories. These findings are summarized in  . \n  \nMAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for amygdala activity. (A) Anatomical definitions of the amygdala, basolateral amygdala and centromedial amygdala used to select the voxels for ICM analysis ( ). (B) Pattern similarity measures for ICM-F (blue) and ICM-A (red) and each of the five MAMs, summarized by the ROIs used to define the amygdala and its subregions. Overall, neither ICM-F nor ICM-A exhibited pattern similarity with either MAM-F or MAM-A. (C) Plotting the effect sizes from repeated-measures ANOVA showed a very small overall effect, regardless of activation locus (i.e. whole amygdala or subregion). The line graphs on the left represent the findings from the whole-brain pattern similarity analysis (i.e. same as  ). (D) Similar findings were observed with the very small effect size for the paired   t  -tests. \n  \n\n### Non-amygdala MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for fear and anger \n  \nNearly identical results as the whole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity analysis were observed when the main analyses were repeated after excluding amygdala voxels ( ). \n  \nNon-amygdala MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity. (A) Pattern similarity measures for ICM-F (blue) and ICM-A (red) and each of the five MAMs, summarized by varying threshold levels. Overall, both ICM-F and ICM-A showed nearly identical results as the whole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity analysis that included the amygdala. (B) Plotting the effect sizes from repeated-measures ANOVA showed a gradually declining trend as a function of increased threshold levels. The line graphs on the left depict the results using whole-brain voxels (i.e. amygdala included), and the line graphs on the right show the results using all non-amygdala voxels. (C) A similar trend was found when the effect sizes from paired   t  -tests were plotted. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we compared reference MAMs generated for five distinct categories of emotion with fear and anger ICMs from a large study sample. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that both ICMs exhibited the greatest pattern similarity to fear MAMs relative to all other MAMs including anger, which may be explained by considering that the ICMs reflect emotion perception, whereas the MAMs represent both emotion perception and expression. The degree of pattern similarity decreased as the number of voxels included in the computation of the MAMs became more selective (i.e. decreased), suggesting that more distributed patterns of brain activity are better reflective of a specific emotion category. Furthermore, amygdala activity associated with either ICM was neither sufficient nor necessary for determining the overall pattern similarity between the ICMs and MAMs. \n\nAs predicted, MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity for fear and anger was significantly greater than zero but generally weak. This may reflect the heterogeneity inherent to the MAMs in comparison with the ICMs. The MAMs were generated from multiple studies that have used heterogeneous stimuli (e.g. faces, pictures, words, films and sounds) that would enable the extraction of a latent neural pattern for a given emotion, whereas the ICMs were strictly based on facial expressions and thus study-specific by nature. Moreover, it is again worth noting that the MAMs include studies that involve different psychological processes with regard to emotion\u2014for example, watching an emotionally charged video clip would likely evoke subjective feelings of such emotion, whereas evaluating still photos of emotional facial expressions rarely would. Thus, the significant yet weak overall correlation between a given MAM\u2013ICM pair is not surprising, as it may be partly attributable to this qualitative difference across the maps; another plausible reason is the inclusion of likely non-informative, noisy voxels present in the initial analysis with unthresholded MAM\u2013ICM pairs. Yet another possibility is the effect of idiosyncratic brain responses across ICMs, which was supported by a boost in overall pattern similarity with MAMs when aggregated group maps of ICMs (second-level random effects models) were used (see  ). Regardless, ICM-F did exhibit the greatest pattern similarity with MAM-F as expected. This implies that ICM-F does capture a putative neural correlate of \u2018fear\u2019 embedded within distributed brain activity and provides support for the research strategy employed in the present study. In other words, these neural activity patterns indicate responses embedded within brain voxels to the emotion of fear. These could range from a subjective feeling of fear or being in a fearful state (i.e. being afraid) to recognizing fear from another person\u2019s face (i.e. cognitive processing of fear information). \n\nHowever, ICM-A did not exhibit the greatest pattern similarity with MAM-A. In fact, ICM-A exhibited the greatest pattern similarity to MAM-F. This suggests that the distributed brain activity associated with ICM-A is more similar to neural activity patterns representing fear than anger. While this would appear to be paradoxical, a plausible explanation can be offered by considering the potential differences in the perception   vs   experience of emotions ( ). The key here is the use of angry facial expressions with directed eye-gaze in our emotional face-matching task. Angry faces with eye-gaze oriented toward the perceiver by default signal an impending aggression on the part of the expressor ( ;  ), which is reflected as differential patterns of brain activity to angry faces with direct gaze vs. averted gaze ( ;  ;  ;  ). From the perspective of the perceiver, the primary signal being communicated via anger faces is an increase in the probability of impending threat, not unlike fear faces ( ). It follows then that the perceiver\u2019s typical response to such angry faces would better align with a threat-related response that is reminiscent of fear more so than anger. Since the MAM-A was generated from individual studies employing not just facial expressions but also other anger-\u2018inducing\u2019 stimuli, it can be understood as representing the feeling of anger   per se  , not the response to someone else\u2019s anger directed at the perceiver. Thus, the present results showing that ICM-A is more similar to neural activity patterns representing fear than anger could be consistent with brain activity in response to interpersonal threat (i.e. angry faces with gaze directed toward the perceiver). However, an alternative explanation is possible via differences in the decoding performance between MAM-F (86% accuracy) and MAM-A (43% accuracy) documented in the original study ( ). These authors suggested that this performance difference might be an artifact of relatively greater methodological heterogeneity in research on anger compared to fear (see   of   for details). Thus, it is possible that this performance discrepancy may be driving the higher pattern similarities between ICM-A and MAM-F in our analyses (i.e. MAM-A might simply be a poorer map). That said, control analyses showed little evidence that surprise ICMs are strongly associated with MAM-F, providing support to the possibility that ICM-F and ICM-A might be converging on a common neural representation of threat embedded within MAM-F (see  ). \n\nThese MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity results were dependent on the number of voxels that were included in the analysis. By systematically manipulating the number of selected voxels, we found that, in general, more voxels yielded better outcomes. Another outcome associated with voxel selection via threshold manipulation is that the range of values that the voxels can assume becomes restricted, which may also have contributed to the smaller effect sizes observed at more stringent threshold levels. However, since the inclusion of all voxels in the brain would necessarily contain those without any informational value (reflected as weak overall MAM\u2013ICM correlations in the unthresholded analysis), additional considerations were warranted. An initial survey of the effect sizes as well as the size of the pattern similarity metrics suggested that a light threshold (0.001\u20130.005) provides the optimal solution, which still covers a wide range of cortical and subcortical brain regions. The distributed nature of these most informative voxels is consistent with the predictions of the original meta-analysis study ( ) and generally in line with the constructionist view of emotion ( ;  ), as well as findings from MVPA research on distinct emotion categories ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our data offer another piece of evidence that information about emotion categories are distributed, not localized in brain activity. \n\nThis interpretation of the present findings is furthered by the amygdala ROI analyses. If we suppose that all of the important information regarding emotion categories was being represented within the amygdala, then restricting the analysis only to the amygdala voxels should have yielded the same MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity outcomes from the whole-brain analyses. Our data did not support this supposition, further reinforcing the main result that the inclusion of more voxels across the brain was generally beneficial in matching ICMs with MAMs. Relatedly, it is noteworthy that both MAM-F and MAM-A are characterized by similar patterns of amygdala activity ( ), which was corroborated by our findings that MAM-F and MAM-A exhibited the greatest similarity over and beyond other MAM pairs (see  ). This suggests the possibility that this shared feature of the MAM-F and MAM-A may drive the pattern similarity with the corresponding ICMs, as both ICM-F and ICM-A are also characterized by increased amygdala activity. Our data rejected this possibility, as excluding the amygdala voxels from the analyses did not change the overall results. In fact, the findings remained remarkably similar to the whole-brain MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity findings, with minimal changes in   z   scores and effect sizes. This illustrates that the amygdala voxels did not contribute to distinguishing discrete emotion categories in a significant way, and thus, the informational value of the amygdala, at least by itself, was negligible. \n\nFinally, we note that the overall degree of pattern similarity with MAMs increased when using group contrast maps instead of ICMs (see  ). Conceptually, this observation is consistent with the fact that group contrast maps are aggregations of multiple ICMs, which offer a distilled representation of a given brain state similar to MAMs. This intermediate position of the group contrast maps (i.e. averages) between MAMs (i.e. averages of averages) and ICMs (i.e. individuals) could account for the boost in pattern similarity metrics with MAMs. An important issue to consider further is the possibility that group contrast maps\u2014which are designed to remove noise from individual data and provide generalizable brain maps\u2014may also eliminate meaningful individual differences reflected in distributed activity patterns, and if so, to what extent. \n\nThe present study is not without limitations. The experimental task from which the ICMs were derived exclusively used facial expressions as the emotional stimuli. While facial expressions are widely used in the literature to examine brain responses to emotion ( ), affective information is represented in the brain in both a modality-specific and modality-general manner ( ;  ;  ); thus, testing the generalizability of the present findings using ICMs derived from other modalities is warranted. It is worth noting yet again that the MAMs used in the present study were generated using individual studies employing heterogeneous stimuli to represent or elicit emotions (e.g. faces, pictures, films and words). Thus, the resulting MAMs may be capturing modality-general neural activity patterns of emotions in the brain. Also, we were only able to focus on the two threat-related emotions (fear and anger), as our emotional face-matching task did not include the three other emotion categories for which there are MAMs. As such, it remains to be seen whether ICMs of other emotions (disgust, happiness and sadness) would show similar mappings onto corresponding MAMs. Next, we observed an unexpected pattern similarity between both ICM-F and ICM-A with MAM-H when the analysis was restricted to amygdala voxels. As there are no known psychological processes that would support this, it is likely that this may simply reflect an artifact stemming from the analyses relying on far fewer voxels with a more restricted range of values. Thus, we are cautious not to overinterpret this observation. We also acknowledge that the effect sizes of the overall pattern similarity between ICMs and the corresponding MAMs are small. A MAM would ideally represent a distilled brain map for a given emotion, whereas an ICM would represent a specific type of affective signal (e.g. fear information processing from the facial expressions of others) plus the overall brain state that is specific to the task used in our study. The inherent study-specific nature of ICMs may contribute to the small shared variance with MAMs. In our analyses, we tested for linear associations between the voxel values that the MAMs and ICMs assume. While this decision reflects, in part, the proof-of-concept nature of the initial analysis (e.g. fear MAM\u2013ICM pair showing the greatest pattern similarity) as well as previous instances of employing similar approaches and achieving useful findings (e.g.  ), we acknowledge the possibility that assuming a linear relationship could be suboptimal, and further investigation on this matter is warranted. Finally, findings from meta-analyses (i.e. MAMs) are inherently bound by the quality of the individual data ( ). As technical advances in fMRI data acquisition and processing have been made in recent years, it would be worthwhile revisiting the current research topic when updated MAMs that include post-2011 studies become available. \n\nThese limitations notwithstanding, our current findings highlight that widely distributed patterns of brain activity from ICMs of threat-related emotion perception, across multiple brain regions and systems, may be best suited for capturing emotion categories identified by MAMs. In contrast, the amygdala was neither sufficient nor necessary for observing such MAM\u2013ICM pattern similarity effects across discrete emotion categories. More generally, the present study offers a strategy that could further boost the utility of MAMs, whose importance has become increasingly recognized in neuroimaging research. For example, MAMs may be used as a guide to chart individual brain states and offer a principled framework for reverse inference from functional neuroimaging data ( ). If we have MAMs for fear that tap into different aspects of fear processing, future research can offer a way to harness them and predict what type of psychological state (e.g. feeling afraid   vs   remembering being afraid) an individual was experiencing during scanning. As such, MAMs may be able to further shed light on the underlying mental processes captured by ICMs, which can contribute to better interpretations of findings using contrast-based task fMRI. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9433847,"text_md5":"d3821cca596544f202a44251ef611820","field_positions":{"authors":[0,54],"journal":[55,79],"publication_year":[81,85],"title":[96,247],"keywords":[261,321],"abstract":[334,1739],"body":[1748,42950]},"batch":2,"pmid":35137241,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsac010","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9433847","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9433847"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9433847\">9433847<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9433847  Meta-analytic activation maps can help identify affective processes captured by contrast-based task fMRI: the case of threat-related facial expressions"}

Acupuncture is an effective clinical treatment for CP, and some fMRI studies were conducted to discover the alternation of brain regions after acupuncture therapy for CP. However, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging studies has prevented researchers from systematically generalizing the central mechanisms of acupuncture in the treatment of CP. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe searched bibliographic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ScienceDirect, China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database, etc., and trials registration platforms (From inception to September 1 , 2022). Two independent researchers assessed the study's bias and quality. Furthermore, activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis was applied to explore aberrant brain functional activity and acupuncture's central mechanism for CP. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTotally 14 studies with 524 CP patients were included in the study. ALE analysis showed that CP patients presented with decreased ALFF\/ReHo in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, right inferior parietal lobule, right superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus including medial prefrontal gurus, left middle frontal gyrus. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis ALE meta-analysis pointed out that acupuncture could modulate the default mode network, the frontoparietal network to treat CP. This provided a systematic summary of the neuroimage biomarker of acupuncture for the treatment of CP. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \nPROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021239633. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChronic pain (CP), one of the most common and long-standing neurological disease, persists affecting the health and quality of life of patients worldwide (Goldberg and McGee,  ; Dureja et al.,  ; Dahlhamer et al.,  ). Neuroscience evidence pointed out that CP itself altered brain activities, including endogenous pain control, suggesting that controlling pain became increasingly difficult as the pain became chronic (Fine,  ; Hasvik et al.,  ; Noori et al.,  ). The introduction of the biopsychosocial model of pain during the past decade stimulated the development of more therapeutically effective and cost-effective interdisciplinary CP management programs. \n\nIn 1998, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) first endorsed acupuncture for treating CP disorders (Ulett et al.,  ). And throughout the past few years, acupuncture as a complementary alternative therapy has gained increasing popularity in the treatment of CP, with a large number of clinical studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy (Manheimer et al.,  ; Yuan et al.,  ; Vickers et al.,  ; Berger et al.,  ; Turkistani et al.,  ). \n\nResting state-functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI), an imaging technique based on the assessment of hemodynamic blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effects, is frequently utilized to explore the brain modification of acupuncture for CP. For instance, fMRI studies have demonstrated that acupuncture could achieve therapeutic effects by modulating a variety of brain networks in CP, such as the emotional response network (Kong et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ), the default network (DMN) (Hou et al.,  ; Zou et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ), the frontoparietal network (FPN) (Kong et al.,  ), etc. \n\nIndividual experiments with limited sample sizes and low test thresholds were, nevertheless, susceptible to yielding false positive results. In addition to the variety of experimental designs employed in the study, these factors provided substantial variation in the reported outcomes. Therefore, a synthesis of results across experiments is needed to determine consistent and systematic brian modulation mechanisms of acupuncture for CP. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a reliable meta-analysis method based on whole-brain coordinates established by Turkeltaub et al. ( ,  ), aiming at determining above-chance convergence of activation probabilities between experiments. Although ALE has been widely utilized in the field of neuroimaging (Chen et al.,  ; Chavanne and Robinson,  ; Xu et al.,  ), no researchers have used ALE algorithm to examine the modulation of whole-brain function changes by acupuncture in CP patients. \n\nTo address the abovementioned issues, the purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate and analyze the changes of brain functional activity in CP patients and the regulation of brain functional activity after acupuncture treatment using a meta-analytical approach based on ALE algorithm. Our results may provide a more illustrative visual basis for elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for CP. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \n#### Retrieval strategies \n  \nThis systematic and standardized meta-analyses was corresponding to the Preferred Reporting Items (PRISMA) for sources including bibliographic databases, reference lists of eligible studies and review articles, and trial registers (Page et al.,  ). Bibliographic databases included MEDLINE   via   PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ScienceDirect, China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database, China Doctoral Dissertation Full-text Database, China Excellent Master Dissertation Full-Text Database, Wanfang Database, Database of Chinese Sci-Tech Journals, and China Biomedical Literature Database. Trials register platforms included ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register. Search date was from inception to September 1st, 2022. We only included studies published in Chinese or English. The search strategy of PubMed was shown in  . \n\n\n#### Selection criteria \n  \n##### Inclusion criteria \n  \nEach article was subsequently reviewed (first by abstract, then by full-text) for relevance to the study and inclusion of all following criteria: \n  \n1) Adults diagnosed as CP (Treede et al.,  ,  ) (musculoskeletal, osteoarthritis, and headache, diagnosed using any recognized diagnostic criteria); \n  \n2) Administered acupuncture (defined as inserting the needle into the skin surface of the acupoint, such as manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, etc.) as a therapeutic measure; \n  \n3) Were rs-fMRI studies; \n  \n4) Whole-brain analysis that reported coordinates for brain activities with standard anatomical reference space (Talairach or MNI); \n  \n5) Performed a statistical comparison (patients before and after acupuncture therapy or patients vs. healthy people). \n  \n\n##### Exclusion criteria \n  \nThe studies met one of the following items were excluded: \n  \n1) Based on partial coverage or employing only region-of-interest (ROI) analyses; \n  \n2) The subjects (or a subgroup of subjects) were included in another study; \n  \n3) Studies based on ROI analyses or non-fMRI studies; \n  \n4) Were reviews or meta-analysis; \n  \n5) Incomplete information or secondary processed studies. \n  \n\n\n#### Data extraction \n  \nTwo reviewers (WRR and WW) independently selected, extracted, and checked the data. The items included: author name, published year, title, journal name, CP categories, acupuncture type, sample size, gender differences, patients' age, analysis methods, foci details etc. When there was any disagreement, a third reviewer (YZ) participated in the decision. \n\n\n\n### Quality assessments \n  \nTwo reviewers (WRR and WW) scored the completeness using a 10-point checklist (Strakowski et al.,  ), and assessed the methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tools ( ). The measurement items of ROB tools contained seven different items: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blind of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting and other sources of bias. \n\n\n### ALE analysis \n  \nGinger ALE software ( ) was used for coordinate based meta-analysis. The differences in coordinate-based brain activity changes between CP and health control (HC), or post-pre-acupuncture in CP patients were assessed in this review. A cluster-level family wise error (FWE) correction was applied (  P   < 0.05) with thresholding permutations of 5,000 times (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). The resulting peak coordinates are reported in Talairach space. Mricron (available at  ) was applied to brain visualization for results of ALE analysis. We did not perform the sensitivity analysis because of the small number of included studies. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search flow \n  \nA total of 1,126 articles were retrieved. After excluding duplicate papers, a total of 851 articles were retained. Based on the title and abstract, a total of 820 papers were excluded, leaving 31 papers remaining. Following a comprehensive full-text scanning and application of established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 studies with 524 CP patients were included in the study (see  ). \n  \nFlow diagram of literature search. \n  \n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nThe included CP conditions were migraine without aura (MwoA) (Zhao et al.,  ; Han et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Ning et al.,  ; Jia et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ); menstrual migraine without aura (MMoa) (Zhang et al.,  ); chronic neck pain (CNP) (Hou et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ); chronic shoulder pain (CSP) (Zhang et al.,  ); chronic low back pain (cLBP) (Makary et al.,  ; Zou et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ); chronic knee osteoarthritis (KOA) (Qu et al.,  ). The studies using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) or regional homogeneity (ReHo) as fMRI analysis methods were included in this study. The characteristics of included studies are summarized in  . \n  \nCharacteristics and clinical information of the included studies. \n  \nMwoA, migraine without aura; MMoa, menstrual migraine without aura; CNP, chronic neck pain; CSP, chronic shoulder pain; cLBP, chronic low back pain; KOA, chronic knee osteoarthritis; PCs, patient control; HCs, health controls; ReHo, regional homogeneity; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; MA, manual acupuncture; EA, electroacupuncture; VA, verum acupuncture; PA, phantom acupuncture; SA, sham acupuncture; WT, waiting-list; FDR, false discovery rate; FWE, family wise error; NA, not available. \n  \n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe quality control assessments by Strakowski's checklist showed that the completeness scores of the included studies are generally high (see  ). Furthermore, two reviewers (WRR and WW) independently evaluated the methodological quality of the 14 included studies (see   and  ). Only two studies (Zhao et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ) reported entirely random sequences and allocation concealment, and only one research (Liu et al.,  ) mentioned participant blinding, which indicates that the majority of publications have a moderate risk of bias, predominantly in the areas of selection and performance bias. \n  \nRisk of bias of each included study using Revman. \n  \n\n### ALE results \n  \nCompared to the HC, patients with CP had decreased ALFF\/ReHo of left caudate and left thalamus; increased ALFF\/ReHo of right fusiform gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and bilateral medial frontal gyrus, left rectus, left cingulate cortex including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (see  ,  ,  ). \n\nAfter acupuncture therapy, CP patients presented with decreased ALFF\/ReHo in the precuneus, PCC, right inferior parietal lobule, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), cingulate gyrus, SFG, left medial frontal gyrus including medial prefrontal gurus (mPFC), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (see   and  ). \n  \nBrian regions with decreased signals pre- and post-acupuncture. A cluster-level FWE correction was applied (  P   < 0.05). \n    \nThe results pf peak coordinates from ALE analysis pre- and post- acupuncture. \n  \nA negative Z value means decreased fMRI signal after acupuncture. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current ALE meta-analysis pooled 14 fMRI studies based on coordinates encompassing 6 types of CP (MwoA, Mmoa, CNP, CSP, cLBP, KOA) to determine the effects of acupuncture on brain regions. The quality of the included studies were relatively moderate, as determined by the ROB checklist and quality reporting standard guidelines. According to rs-fMRI studies of CP patients treated with acupuncture, the modulation pattern of CP by acupuncture included a reduction of ALFF\/ReHo signals in the DMN (precuneus, PCC), and FPN (SFG, mPFC, MFG). The findings confirmed that acupuncture may produce the therapeutic effect on CP by modulating the brain regions associated with emotion and cognition. In addition, similar to the findings of previous studies, abnormalities in the caudate, thalamus, fusiform gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex were also identified in CP patients in this review. These abnormalities in CP were associated with pain processing, cognitive abnormalities, and emotion regulation functions. \n\nThe trajectory of chronic pain occurred over time, with intensity continuing and fluctuating (Mayr et al.,  ). Meanwhile, the perception of pain is a personal and multidimensional experience, with causes mood changes such as anxiety, depression and fear (Moriarty et al.,  ; Bushnell et al.,  ; Moseley and Vlaeyen,  ). The present review partially revealed the abnormal functional activity in brain regions such as caudate, thalamus, and PFC in patients with CP. In fact, early studies already found abnormal functional activities in brain regions and networks, such as DMN and the salience network (Greenwald and Shafritz,  ). At the cellular level, central sensitization may be reversed by degrading glutamate receptor pathways, but occurs rarely (Woolf,  ). Instead, cortical brain regions may have top-down modulation to alleviate pain. \n\nThese results aligned with the previous ALE research (Ha et al.,  ) for acupuncture modifying musculoskeletal pain, in that both found therapeutic effects of acupuncture in the brain regions of the caudate, and thalamus. Methodological factors may have contributed to the differences between our study and those of earlier findings. Firstly, we included several kinds of CPs, including osteoarthritis, and headache, rather than just musculoskeletal pain. Secondly, we only included research reporting whole-brain analyses; some ROI-based approaches were omitted in order to eliminate the possibility of regional bias. We ultimately included 14 studies of moderate quality. Notably, the fact that almost all studies did not satisfy the recommended research a voxel-level threshold of   P   < 0.001 or a cluster-corrected threshold of   P   < 0.05 contributed to the drop in study quality. We also did not require such a test threshold in this study, as this may not have included enough studies. \n\nSix different types of CP were covered in this study. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of acupuncture modulation of different type of CP might be distinct. For an instance, MwoA is neuropathic pain, whereas KOA is nociceptive pain. The pathogenic causes and mental state of the patients are diverse between these two disorders, resulting in modifications to distinct brain regions. In KOA, altered CNS activity led to a sense of pain in the absence of peripheral tissue injury or inflammation. Patients' anticipatory of pain may modify the forthcoming pain-evoking activation and pain sensation, as evidenced by limbic system brain activation (Jones et al.,  ). Nociceptive pain is somatic and visceral, which differ in their psychophysical and neurobiological mechanisms (Cervero,  ). The main difference between them was the process of pain signaling and processing, which leads to different pain perception. \n\nThe ALE analysis in this study indicated the brain networks that acupuncture could modulate in CP patients were the DMN, FPN, suggesting a modulatory effect of acupuncture on CP at the neural network level. The DMN is an important resting brain functional network consisting of the precuneus, mPFC, inferior parietal lobule and PCC (Buckner et al.,  ; Raichle,  ). As a major component of the DMN, the precuneus is responsible for processing negative emotions caused by pain or other discomfort and plays an important role in the cognitive function network (Cavanna and Trimble,  ; Blessing et al.,  ). Our previous study discovered that acupuncture increased the unusually low precuneus brain metabolism in migraine sufferers (Yang et al.,  ). In conjunction with the results of ALE, it showed that acupuncture could modulate the abnormal precuneus function in CP to achieve a smooth strip of emotional cognition. \n\nThe cingulate gyrus is part of the DMN and limbic system, involving in pain perception and pain signaling. Patients with persistent neck and shoulder discomfort exhibited aberrant ALFF signal in the cingulate gyrus and precentral gyrus, compared to HCs (Yue and Du,  ). Also, acupuncture could modulate brain regions involved in limbic system to achieve pain relief or relieve negative effects (Shi et al.,  ), such as hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus (Hui et al.,  ). In other words, acupuncture could modulate the abnormal functional activity of the limbic system in patients with CP. \n\nThe FPN was essential for pain processing involved in attention and cognitive control, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and mPFC. Correspondingly, the present review suggested that acupuncture could modulate a wide range of FPN regions, including SFG, mPFC, MFG. Acupuncture has been extensively explored for its capacity to alleviate pain by modifying the dysfunctional DLPFC (He et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). Consequencely, Ong's team revealed the importance of PFC during placebo analgesia and in establishing a connection between pain and pain alleviation in bouts of cognitive performance, anxiety, and cognitive decline (Ong et al.,  ). However, a PET-CT study revealed real acupuncture for KOA leaded to greater activation of the right DLPFC, ACC, and midbrain (Pariente et al.,  ) than sham acupuncture, indicating the differences in the modulation of brain regions by real and sham acupuncture. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis meta-analysis focused on whole-brain, resting brain function alterations in chronic pain improvement with acupuncture. Due to the general quality of the included studies, the results should be interpreted with caution. However, we included only 14 studies and did not perform a sensitivity analysis. The findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of included studies and the heterogeneity in trial design and demographic baseline between studies. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis is the first cross-study coordinate-based meta-analysis to uncover the modulation mechanisms of acupuncture in CP. The results of this review provide neuroimaging evidence for acupuncture in the treatment of CP. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nZY, R-RW, WW, and L-YL: concept and design.

Neuroimaging studies typically seek to isolate one specific aspect of social cognition when trying to map its neural substrates. It is unclear if brain activation elicited by different social cognitive processes and task instructions are also spontaneously elicited by general social information. In this study, we investigated whether these brain regions are evoked by the mere presence of social information using an automated meta-analysis and confirmatory data from an independent study of simple appraisal of social vs. non-social images. Results of 1,000 published fMRI studies containing the keyword of \u201csocial\u201d were subject to an automated meta-analysis ( ). To confirm that significant brain regions in the meta-analysis were driven by a social effect, these brain regions were used as regions of interest (ROIs) to extract and compare BOLD fMRI signals of social vs. non-social conditions in the independent study. The NeuroSynth results indicated that the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral amygdala, bilateral occipito-temporal junction, right fusiform gyrus, bilateral temporal pole, and right inferior frontal gyrus are commonly engaged in studies with a prominent social element. The social\u2013non-social contrast in the independent study showed a strong resemblance to the NeuroSynth map. ROI analyses revealed that a social effect was credible in 9 out of the 11 NeuroSynth regions in the independent dataset. The findings support the conclusion that the \u201csocial brain\u201d is highly sensitive to the mere presence of social information. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSocial cognition\u2014the cognitive processes involved in processing information about self, other people, interpersonal relationships, and social interactions [ ]\u2014is critical to social development and adaptation. Understanding how the human brain processes social information has been an increasingly important topic in psychology and neuroscience. Research in this area not only has increased our knowledge of the functional specialization and organization of the healthy brain, but also provides a promising avenue to uncover the pathogenesis of complex neuropsychiatric disorders in which abnormal social information processing is a prominent feature, such as schizophrenia [ ] and autism [ ]. \n\nSocial cognition comprises many cognitive processes, including perception of socially relevant cues (faces, eye gaze, facial expressions, prosody, body movements and gesture), understanding and making inferences about others' mental state, forming judgments of others, and reflection on the self and its relation to others. Several brain regions are often implicated in social information processing, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), superior temporal sulcus\/gyrus (STS\/STG), fusiform gyrus, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), temporal pole, precuneus\/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and amygdala [ \u2013 ]. The wealth of research data in this area has provided some clues about the roles of these brain regions in social information processing, although delineating their fine-grained functional specializations is still an active topic of investigation. Some conclusions about specialized social functions have emerged from the literature. For example, the mPFC appears to be associated with forming meta-representations of the self and the mental states of other people [ ]; lesions in this region result in deficits in interpreting nonverbal social information, recognizing social faux pas and sarcasm, and showing empathic concern for others [ \u2013 ]. Activity in the posterior STS\/STG, fusiform gyrus, and anterior temporal cortex is elicited by face and eye gaze processing [ , ], observation of biological motion [ ], and inferring intentions from others\u2019 actions [ , ]. Activity in the TPJ is associated with both mental and spatial perspective taking [ , ] and understanding false beliefs [ , ]. The PCC is thought to integrate emotional and autobiographical memory in the personal context during self-referential information processing [ ]. The amygdala is involved in making judgments about faces and shows increased activation to untrustworthy relative to trustworthy faces [ ]. \n\nIn order to map neural substrates of social cognition, neuroimaging researchers typically design a task which seeks to isolate one specific process, such as theory of mind [ ], leading to activation patterns thought to be specific to that process. In this study, we took a slightly different approach, namely to address the question as to   whether these brain regions are evoked by the mere presence of social information  . One possibility is that very specific tasks are required to activate these regions; whereas the alternative possibility is that the mere presence of social information, regardless of task instructions, is sufficient to activate these areas. One might expect the latter case, given that social processing is so robust and deeply programmed into the cognitive-perceptual machinery that they are easily \u2018turned on.\u2019 To test the hypothesis that most of the regions described above are more generally dedicated to social information, we employed a two-step strategy. Using an automated meta-analysis, NeuroSynth ( ; 30), we first identified the brain regions found in published neuroimaging studies that contained the word \u2018social\u2019 in the text at a prominent frequency (> 1 in 1000 words), regardless of specific tasks, instructions, and contrasts. This affords us an inclusive and comprehensive picture of the \u201csocial brain regions\u201d commonly appearing in the literature, but elicited by a variety of tasks and paradigms (e.g., facial emotion discrimination, social and moral judgment, theory of mind, social exclusion, gambling task, rewarding processing, response inhibition) and stimuli (e.g., faces, geometric shapes, cartoon strips, vocal sounds, speech). In a second step, we conducted an independent neuroimaging study in which subjects viewed complex visual images depicting social and non-social scenes of varying emotional valence. Subjects performed a simple valence appraisal task in which the socialness of the stimuli was manipulated while holding constant other stimuli characteristics (e.g., visual complexity, valence, arousal). Although this task involved specific cognitive processes related to valence appraisal, by contrasting the social and non-social conditions, we were able to isolate brain activation specific to the mere presence of information that is social in nature. We hypothesized that a majority of the brain regions identified using the NeuroSynth results would show preferential activation for social (as opposed to non-social) images in the independent study, providing support for the hypothesis that \u201cthe social brain\u201d is very sensitive to the mere presence of social information. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Automated meta-analysis \n  \nThe first part of the analyses of this study aimed to identify the brain regions that have shown significant activation in published fMRI studies with a prominent social element in the literature. Using the keyword \u201csocial\u201d yielded 1,000 published fMRI studies to include in an automated meta-analysis on   ( ) [ ]. We used the reverse inference map of the result of the automated meta-analysis, which represents z-scores corresponding to the likelihood that the term \u201csocial\u201d is used in a study given the presence of reported activation (i.e., P[Social|Activation]). It is obtained by comparing all the studies in the Neurosynth database that contain \u201csocial\u201d and those that do not. The significant brain regions showing up in the reverse inference map represent those that are more likely to be reported in \u201csocial\u201d studies than in \u201cnon-social\u201d studies. In contrast, the forward inference map (P[Activation|Social]) does not consider the base-rate activation of the regions, and the result may very well include regions that are involved in almost every task. As such, the reverse inference map is a better indicator of   how specific   the activated regions are to social information processing. The activation map was thresholded at FDR-corrected   p   < 0.01 by default, yielding 135 significant clusters. The majority of the clusters were very small in terms of voxel size (< 10 voxels). Eleven clusters were \u2265 100 voxels in size and were selected to represent \u201csocial brain regions in the literature.\u201d Since the resolution of the NeuroSynth map was higher than that of the independent dataset, the NeuroSynth results were downsampled from a voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm  to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm  to facilitate later comparisons. Masks derived from the 11 regions served as the regions of interest (ROIs) for beta extraction for the independent study. \n\n\n### Independent study \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nFifteen healthy participants were recruited from community advertisements and completed the study. All participants were free of Axis I psychiatric disorders as established with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis, non-patient version (SCID-NP) [ ] and were not taking any medications. The risks of the study were explained to all participants prior to obtaining their written, informed consent to participate. The study was conducted in accordance to the study protocol with ethical standards in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (IRBMED), IRBMED# 2001\u20130283. One participant\u2019s fMRI data were lost due to archival errors; data of the remaining 14 (4 female) participants, aged from 23 to 50 years (mean = 38.6, SD = 10.1), were included in the analyses of this report. A previous peer-reviewed publication reported on different aspects of this sample using this paradigm [ ]. \n\n\n#### Visual stimuli \n  \nOne hundred and twenty (including 60 social and 60 non-social) complex images were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [ ]. Image selection began with identifying images that contained the presence of human and\/or interactions between social animals as candidate social images, and those that contained landscapes or physical objects only as candidate non-social images. Candidate images were then classified as negative, neutral, and positive based on their normative valence ratings. Finally, 20 negative, 20 neutral, and 20 positive images were selected for each of the social and non-social conditions such that the two conditions were matched on valence and arousal based on the normative ratings associated with each image. Some examples of these images included: a gory face (social, negative), a soiled toilet (non-social, negative), a man facing a computer monitor (social, neutral), a bus (nonsocial, neutral), two children playing with cats (social, positive), and a colorful flower field (nonsocial, positive). Equivalent valence and arousal of the social and non-social images was later confirmed using the subjective ratings by the participants in the independent study (see   and more details of procedure below). A complete list of the IAPS images used in the independent study can be found in supporting information  . \n   Characteristics of the social and non-social images used in this study.  \n a)   Subjective valance (  p   = .647) and arousal ratings (  p   = .464) by the participants did not differ significantly between the social and non-social conditions.   b)   Image appraisal time in the scanner did not differ significantly between the social and non-social conditions (  p   = .856). Vertical lines represent standard errors of mean. \n  \nIn addition to the IAPS images, \u201cblank\u201d (BL) images were included as a baseline condition. They were 4 unique kinds of images composed of a colored polygon against a lightly textured, gray-toned background of varying shades. The contrast and brightness of each set of the images were adjusted to match on total luminance using Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems). \n\n\n#### Appraisal task: Design and procedure \n  \nThe images were presented in 20-second blocks; each block consisted of 4 images and each image was presented for 5 seconds. For each image, participants were instructed to form a judgment as to whether it was pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant, and to press a button to signal that they had formed a judgment. Appraisal duration for social and non-social images did not differ significantly ( ). The task consisted of a total of 30 blocks of IAPS images divided into 5 runs. Blocks of IAPS images alternated with blocks of BL images. Participants completed a practice session before the fMRI scanning to ensure comprehension of the task. Participants\u2019 attention was monitored using an eye tracker in the scanner. \n\nImmediately after the fMRI session, participants viewed all of the IAPS images again on a computer outside of the scanner, presented in a randomized order, and rated each image for valence and arousal on a 7-point scale. For valence, the prompt question was \u201cHow pleasant or unpleasant does this picture make you feel?\u201d and participants chose a number between 1 and 7, with 1 = \u201cExtremely unpleasant,\u201d 2 = \u201cVery unpleasant,\u201d 3 = \u201cMildly unpleasant,\u201d 4 = \u201cNeither,\u201d 5 = \u201cMildly pleasant,\u201d 6 = \u201cVery pleasant,\u201d and 7 = \u201cExtremely pleasant.\u201d For arousal, the prompt question was \u201cHow calm or excited\/aroused does this picture make you feel?\u201d and participants chose a number between 1 and 7, which was accompanied by a description \u201cCalm, not aroused\/excited \u2192 A little \u2192 Moderately \u2192 Very \u2192 Extremely aroused\/excited.\u201d Social and non-social images were similar in both valence and arousal ratings,  . \n\n\n#### fMRI acquisition and processing \n  \nMRI scanning occurred on a GE 3T Signa scanner (LX [8.3] release, General Electric Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). A T1-weighted image was acquired in the same prescription as the functional images to facilitate co-registration. Functional images were acquired with a T2*-weighted, reverse spiral acquisition sequence (gradient recalled echo, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FA = 90 degrees, field of view = 20 cm, 40 slice, 3.0mm thick\/0mm skip, equivalent to 64 x 64 voxel grid) sensitive to signal in ventral medial frontal regions [ ]. Subjects underwent 5 runs (6 blocks\/runs), each consisting of 120 volumes, plus 4 initial, discarded volumes to allow for equilibration of scanner signal, with isotropic voxels 3 mm after normalization. After acquisition of functional volumes, a high resolution T1 scan (3D SPGR, field of view = 24 cm, TR = 25 ms, TE = 3 ms, 256 \u00d7 160 matrix, 100 slices, 1.5 mm interleaved with no skip) was obtained for anatomic normalization. \n\nfMRI data were preprocessed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) package (Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London) and FSL (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) and standard routines. Slice time was corrected using sinc-interpolation, weighted by a Hanning kernel in time. Then all scans were realigned to the 10th volume acquired during each scan (\"mcflirt\") [ ]. Runs with movement exceeding either 1 voxel or 2 degrees rotation within a scan were discarded; only 1 run of 1 subject was discarded as a result. The time series of functional volumes were then co-registered with the high resolution T1 image, spatially normalized to the MNI152 brain, and then spatially smoothed with a 6 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n#### Statistical analyses \n  \nfMRI data analyses were performed with SPM12. First-level analysis began with applying a high pass filter (128 s) to the anatomically normalized time series, and regressed on 2 regressors (social, non-social) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, along with 24 motion regressors (6 for each translation\/rotation direction, their first derivative, and quadratic terms for each direction and derivative). BL blocks were modeled as implicit baseline. \n\nSecond-level analyses involved both whole-brain and ROI analyses. The former informs the brain regions preferentially responding to social vs. non-social stimuli; the latter reveals the extent to which \u201csocial brain regions\u201d seen in the literature are engaged in processing the social nature of stimuli. \n\nFor the whole-brain analysis, the   t   statistics map of the social\u2013nonsocial contrast was examined. Initial clusters were defined by a voxel threshold of uncorrected   p   < .005; \u201csignificant\u201d clusters were determined by a threshold of false discovery error (FDR) corrected   p   < .05 based on the Gaussian random field theory [ ]. Subsequently, a conjunction analysis was performed to show the overlap between social networks identified in the NeuroSynth result and our data, by first binarizing supra-threshold voxels of the NeuroSynth map and the social\u2013nonsocial contrast map of our data, and then finding the voxels that were above threshold in both maps. \n\nThe ROI analyses involved extracting beta estimates of the social and non-social conditions in the independent study from the 11 NeuroSynth-informed ROIs. This was done by saving each of the Neurosynth ROIs into separate masks, and then applying the masks to the first-level results of the social (vs. baseline) and non-social (vs. baseline) contrasts in the independent study. The first eigenvector of beta estimates from these ROIs was extracted and subject to Bayesian inference. Specifically, we used the anovaBF command of the R package \u201cBayesFactor\u201d [ ] to compare evidence of two competing models\u2014a model containing Socialness as a fixed factor and a null model\u2014for each brain region given the data; subjects were modeled as a random factor in both models. Relative evidence strength of the two models was expressed in Bayes factor, such that a value < 1 indicates evidence favoring the denominator model (null model) over the numerator model (Social effect model), whereas a value > 1 indicates evidence favoring the numerator model over the denominator model. Further, interpretation of   strength of evidence   followed guidelines by Jeffreys [ ], where Bayes factors between 3 and 10 indicate that the support for the Social effect model is \u201csubstantial,\u201d values between 10 and 30 \u201cstrong,\u201d values between 30 and 100 \u201cvery strong,\u201d and values > 100 \u201cdecisive\u201d; similarly, values between 0.10 and 0.33 indicate \u201csubstantial\u201d support for the null model, values between 0.033 and 0.10 \u201cstrong,\u201d values between 0.01 and 0.033 \u201cstrong\u201d support, and values < 0.01 \u201cdecisive.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Whole-brain analyses \n  \nFrom the NeuroSynth data, 11 clusters were identified as \u201csocial\u201d brain regions in the literature: dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), PCC, bilateral amygdala, right fusiform gyrus, bilateral OTJ, bilateral anterior temporal cortex\/temporal pole, and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) ( ). Please note that results are in reduced resolution of voxel size 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm  for easier comparison with the results of the independent dataset in  . \n   \u201cSocial\u201d brain regions identified in the NeuroSynth meta-analysis.           Brain regions showing increased BOLD signals during processing of social vs. non-social images.        \nResults of the social\u2013nonsocial contrast of our data revealed that social images, compared with nonsocial images, elicited significantly higher activation in a number of brain areas, including mPFC extending across ventral and dorsal areas, PCC, bilateral amygdala extending to hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex\/temporal pole, bilateral OTJ extending to fusiform gyri, right superior parietal cortex, and left superior\/middle frontal gyrus ( ). \n\nOverall, the social brain regions identified using the NeuroSynth data and our data showed a strong resemblance.

In all 11 ROIs, social images elicited higher activation than non-social images. Bayesian evidence favored the presence of a Social effect (Bayes factor > 1) in 9 out of the 11 regions (i.e., all but R IFG and L temporal pole). The evidence for a Social effect was \u201csubstantial\u201d or stronger (Bayes factor > 3) in all of these 9 regions\u2014dmPFC, vmPFC, PCC, R fusiform gyrus, bilateral OTJ, R temporal pole, and bilateral amygdala. \n   BOLD signals in social and non-social conditions in the independent dataset in the 11 NeuroSynth \u201csocial\u201d brain regions.  \nBars (left y-axis) represent beta estimates and vertical lines represent standard errors of mean.

We first examined the brain regions commonly activated in a large number (  N   = 1,000) of published fMRI studies involving a prominent social element using the automated meta-analysis method provided by NeuroSynth [ ]. The NeuroSynth map revealed distributed neural substrates related to social processing, including the ventral and dorsal areas of the mPFC, precuneus\/PCC, bilateral amygdala, bilateral OTJ (extending to fusiform gyrus), bilateral anterior temporal cortex\/temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus extending to orbitofrontal cortex. This map is highly consistent with brain regions often implicated in socio-emotional processing in the literature. Then we evaluated if these brain regions are representative of social processing by conducting confirmatory analyses on an independent dataset that specifically compared the socialness of the stimuli. By carefully matching the affective valence and levels of arousal of the images used in the social and non-social conditions, we isolated social processing from other cognitive processes on brain activation. Overlaying the results of the independent study on the NeuroSynth \u201csocial\u201d map showed a strong correspondence of the two maps. ROI analyses examining brain activation in these NeuroSynth regions in our data showed that a credible social effect (social > non-social) was present in 9 out of 11 of these regions. Taken together, the results of this study provided convincing support that a number of brain regions in the human brain are robustly and preferentially activated when processing social information. \n\nThe similarities between the NeuroSynth map and the social\u2013non-social contrast of the independent dataset are remarkable given the differences in methods used to generate the two maps. The NeuroSynth methods elicit very crude \u201ccontrasts\u201d\u2013the studies included were those in which the term \u2018social\u2019 appear in the article text at a \u201chigh\u201d frequency (defined as > 1 in every 1,000 words), and the coordinates that went into the meta-analysis were automatically extracted from all tables reported in these studies, regardless of contrasts or (sub)groups. In the independent study, participants were only given a vague task (to \u201cform a judgment\u201d of the pleasantness of each of the images), rather than told explicitly to attend to the social aspect of the images or to perform a specific social cognitive task. Additionally, the use of the social\u2013nonsocial contrast theoretically canceled out common cognitive processes (particularly, valence appraisal) involved in the two conditions, making it reasonable to assume that the result reflects brain activation associated with the sociality of the stimuli only. The results showed that most of the brain regions from the NeuroSynth map were preferentially engaged in response to the mere presence of sociality in stationary scenes of humans and social interactions, consistent with the assertion that most social signals are processed nearly automatically [ ]. The strong correspondence between the NeuroSynth and the independent study suggests that regardless of tasks and methods, certain cognitive processes are easily involved in processing information social in nature: analysis of postures and biological motion (OTJ) [ ], accessing social knowledge (temporal pole) [ ], autobiographical recollection (PCC) [ ], and reflection on feelings and self-reference (mPFC) [ ]. Further, the conjunction analysis showed extensive overlap between the NeuroSynth map and the whole-brain analysis of the independent dataset. Such overlapping regions may indicate subregions of the general social brain areas that are sensitive to the degree of sociality. \n\nSome brain regions from the NeuroSynth map did not show a credible social effect in the independent data, such as the left temporal pole and right IFG. Additionally, some brain regions that are often implicated in social cognitive processes (e.g., TPJ as involved in theory of mind) did not show up in either the NeuroSynth map or our data. As noted in a review of the social brain [ ], brain regions involved in social cognition are modulated by the task context and individual factors such as volitional regulation. The lack of a credible social effect in the left temporal pole and the right IFG in the independent data could be due to that cognitive processes recruiting the left temporal pole (e.g., semantic representation of sounds or objects) and the IFG (e.g., response inhibition) may be prevalent among studies included in the Neurosynth map but not required in the appraisal task in the independent study. Similarly, areas such as TPJ did not appear in both the NeuroSynth and the independent study maps may be because mental state attribution was not explicitly required in many of the studies included in the automated meta-analysis. Therefore, the brain regions revealed in our dataset and the NeuroSynth map should not be considered the complete \u201csocial circuitry\u201d given the simple task used in this study and the variable representation of different social cognitive processes in the literature. While the findings provide strong support for social brain modules such as mPFC, PCC, right anterior temporal cortex, amygdala, and OTJ (extending to fusiform gyrus), negative findings in TPJ and other regions do not mean that they are not involved in social information processing. In a similar vein, the \u201csocial\u201d brain regions identified in this study should not be interpreted as responsible for   solely   social information processing, as many (if not all) brain regions are involved in multiple cognitive processes. \n\nThis study is limited by the small sample size of the independent dataset. Although we used social and non-social stimuli carefully matched for valence and arousal, literature-informed ROIs, and Bayesian statistics to increase the scientific rigor and the interpretability of the results, we acknowledge that the results may be different with a larger or different sample. The small sample also precludes the exploration of other important questions such as differences between gender and diverse populations in the social brain network. Future investigations in larger and cross-cultural studies to reveal critical biological and social factors in human social cognition are warranted. \n\nTo conclude, this study provided support that core regions of the human social brain are highly sensitive to the mere presence of social information, including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole, and occipito-temporal junction extending to fusiform gyrus. This knowledge may help guide future developmental and psychopathology research. For example, tracking the qualitative and quantitative changes in this \u201cautomatic\u201d social brain over developmental or illness stages would inform whether such a neural sensitivity to social information is innate, how it is associated with other important developmental milestones and functional markers, how it is influenced by environmental and social factors (e.g., poverty, abuse), and how its alterations may be responsible for the development and symptom manifestations of different psychopathologies. Further, investigations of high-resolution brain specialization as well as anatomical, functional, and effective brain connectivity will help us gain a fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms of social information processing and how the social brain network interacts with other brain systems to guide complex social behavior in normal development and in psychopathologies with prominent social deficits. Finally, the results of this study lend support to the usefulness of NeuroSynth in neuroscience research, as it provides a relatively accurate picture of the neural substrates of a variety of broadly conceived cognitive processes. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5933734,"text_md5":"443a8834cfa7c6aca41bc62fa64801ba","field_positions":{"authors":[0,88],"journal":[89,97],"publication_year":[99,103],"title":[114,248],"keywords":[262,262],"abstract":[275,2068],"body":[2077,30465]},"batch":2,"pmid":29723244,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0196503","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5933734","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5933734"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5933734\">5933734<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5933734  The \u201csocial brain\u201d is highly sensitive to the mere presence of social information: An automated meta-analysis and an independent study"}
{"text":"Todorova, Greta Krasimirova and Hatton, Rosalind Elizabeth Mcbean and Pollick, Frank Earl\nMol Autism, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nBiological motion perception in autism spectrum disorder: a meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nAutism spectrum disorders\nBiological motion\nMeta-analysis\nAge\nEmotion recognition\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nBiological motion, namely the movement of others, conveys information that allows the identification of affective states and intentions. This makes it an important avenue of research in autism spectrum disorder where social functioning is one of the main areas of difficulty. We aimed to create a quantitative summary of previous findings and investigate potential factors, which could explain the variable results found in the literature investigating biological motion perception in autism. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA search from five electronic databases yielded 52 papers eligible for a quantitative summarisation, including behavioural, eye-tracking, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nUsing a three-level random effects meta-analytic approach, we found that individuals with autism generally showed decreased performance in perception and interpretation of biological motion. Results additionally suggest decreased performance when higher order information, such as emotion, is required. Moreover, with the increase of age, the difference between autistic and neurotypical individuals decreases, with children showing the largest effect size overall. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe highlight the need for methodological standards and clear distinctions between the age groups and paradigms utilised when trying to interpret differences between the two populations. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nBiological motion (BM), namely the movement of other humans, conveys information that allows the identification of affective states and intentions [ \u2013 ]. BM processing specifically is the ability of individuals to detect, label and interpret human movement and to allocate certain emotional states to it. Thus, BM is an important component of social perception. Moreover, neurotypically developing (NT) individuals have been shown to be able to readily extract socially relevant information from sparse visual displays [ ,  ]. Specifically, point-light displays (PLDs), which portray BM with points located only on the major joints, are readily recognised as depicting differing actions by NT [ ]. \n\nPavlova [ ] argues that an inability to extract socially relevant information from BM could have damaging effects on social functioning. In fact, individuals with an intellectual disability have been shown to have no problem in identifying different types of motion [ ,  ], whereas individuals with social functioning difficulties such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shown reduced ability in extracting social information from BM [ ]. Indeed, ASD\u2019s main diagnostic characteristics include problems with social interaction and communication as well as repetitive and\/or restrictive behaviours [ ]. Thus, the social impairment in ASD can, to some extent, be readily related to a reduced ability to extract information from BM. \n\nHowever, findings on BM in ASD tend to be mixed [ ]. For example, some studies, which investigated the identification or recognition of actions from BM [ \u2013 ], did not find significant differences between NT and ASD individuals, whereas others have found differences between the two groups [ \u2013 ]. Simmons et al. [ ] and McKay et al. [ ] argue that this is because there is variability between ASD individuals. Several factors have been suggested to introduce this variability. \n\nOne of these potential factors is age. Specifically, on the one hand, it appears that research in children tends to consistently show an impairment in BM interpretation [ ,  ,  ]. Whilst, on the other hand, research in adults does not find differences in performance in action perception and BM recognition [ \u2013 ]. \n\nPerson characteristics such as sex and IQ have also been suggested to contribute to the variability of results. Specifically, IQ has been identified as a predictor of performance in some studies [ ,  ] but not in others [ ,  ,  ]. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis by Van der Hallen et al. [ ] looked at local vs. global paradigms, where individuals have to ignore the global context to be able to focus and perform a task on the specific parts or vice-a-versa. They observed greater differences when the proportion of females was higher. Hence, these demographic characteristics of the samples should be investigated as potential contributors to the variability in the findings. \n\nThe task at hand has also been considered as a contributing factor. Koldewyn et al. [ ] argue that individuals with ASD are able to identify BM presented through simple PLDs from noise and classify them; however, it is the extraction of higher order information, such as emotional content, that shows the largest performance difference. In fact, although Hubert et al. [ ] and Parron et al. [ ] did not find differences between NT and ASD in action recognition, they found differences in emotion recognition from biological motion for adults and children. Additionally, Fridenson-Hayo et al. [ ] found that in children, this difference in emotion recognition from BM is evident for both basic (e.g. happy, sad) and complex emotions (e.g. disappointed, proud) as well as being evident cross culturally (Britain, Sweden, Israel). Thus, both children and adults with ASD tend to be less sensitive to emotional content. \n\nIt has been suggested that eye-tracking research can inform our understanding of the social difficulties in ASD. A review and meta-analysis of eye-tracking studies showed that in ASD, attention to social versus non-social stimuli may be reduced [ ]. The analysis also found that decreased attention might be given to the eyes and increased attention to the mouth and body compared to NT individuals. However, Chita-Tegmark [ ] noted that the results were very mixed. This may have been because the authors tried to include a large number of studies and thus inevitably included a mixture of more than one type of stimuli, including faces, eyes and bodies. Specifically, bodies contain vital social information and are perceptually different from faces [ ]. Thus, different processes may be involved when looking at these different stimuli. Nevertheless, even when looking at eye-tracking studies focusing only on biological motion, the same variability is observed. Namely, in preferential looking paradigms, children have shown reduced visual orientation to biological motion [ ,  ,  ]. This difference between NT and ASD has not been found in adults [ ]. In contrast, Fujisawa et al. [ ] show that pre-school children tend to have a greater preference for upright than inverted BM, which was additionally greater than that in NT children. Hence, it is apparent that inconsistencies in eye-tracking studies also exist but cannot be simply explained by age as a driving factor. \n\nOne study argued that the mixed findings in the BM literature within ASD are due to ASD utilising different brain networks which develop later in life. Hence, McKay et al. [ ] investigated BM perception between ASD and NT and found that the brain areas that communicate with each other in ASD are not the same as the ones found in NT. Specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies tend to find reduced activation in ASD for areas such as the superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. These are all areas that have been found to be related to the perception and interpretation of human motion and actions [ \u2013 ]. NT individuals, however, show connectivity within areas involved with action and human motion observation\u2014such as the inferior and superior parietal lobules. On the other hand, individuals with autism have been found to have brain networks that involve connectivity with the fusiform, middle temporal and occipital gyri, which are all areas considered to be involved in more basic level motion perception rather than action recognition [ ,  ]. \n\nSimilarly, the mirror neuron network (MNN) has been implied to be related to social functioning as it is associated with observing and understanding the actions of others. Thus, Kaiser and Shiffrar [ ] argue that the MNN could contribute to the impairments seen in ASD. Moreover, Villalobos et al. [ ] have shown reduced functional connectivity in the prefrontal mirror neuron area in individuals with ASD. The MNN has mainly been investigated in imitation paradigms [ ,  ] and indeed, dysfunctional activation has been identified in individuals with ASD. However, since the MNN is also involved in understanding others\u2019 actions, its activation during simple action observation has also been investigated in ASD because understanding others\u2019 actions is an integral part of social functioning. Most commonly, mu-suppression has been used to assess human mirror activity [ ] and reduced mu-suppression has been found in ASD participants in comparison to NT individuals both when performing and observing BM [ ,  ]. Thus, it appears that the impairment in the MNN could be another contributing factor to the social difficulty present in BM perception in ASD. \n\nIn order to help bring clarity to the field, there is a need for a quantitative review of the research done on BM perception in ASD. Previous literature reviews have already argued for reduced ability in interpreting social information from BM and about the diagnostic utility of biological motion in ASD [ ,  ]. In one such attempt, Van der Hallen et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis on global motion visual processing differences between individuals with ASD and neurotypically developing individuals in behavioural paradigms. They included 48 studies\u201428 looked at coherent movement processing from random dot kinematograms and 20 looked at biological motion detection or discrimination of BM from other types of motion (i.e. scrambled). Global motion processing in their context refers to being able to combine several moving stimuli into a coherent shape (i.e. PLDs) or to perceive a coherent direction of the motion of dots despite the existence of unrelated distractor noise. Van der Hallen et al. [ ] found overall differences between ASD and NT individuals in global motion processing but did not find a specific effect for biological motion, rather an effect that indicated a general decreased performance in detecting or recognising global motion patterns in perception paradigms. Whilst Van der Hallen et al. [ ] found no effect of potential moderators on group differences; they suggest that this may have been due to underpowered studies rather than there being no real effect. However, they did not include emotion processing paradigms and only compared PLDs and random dot kinematograms despite there being other forms of biological motion paradigms, such as animated humans and videos of humans. Another attempt at summarising the behavioural findings in the field was done by Federici and colleagues [ ]. They focused on characteristics of PLDs, the levels of processing (first-order\/direct\/instrumental) and the manipulation of low level perceptual features in PLDs. They partially answer the question of the effect of the utilised paradigm, showing that when inferring intentions\/actions\/emotions is required in the task and when temporal manipulations are made to the stimuli, the effects are larger. Unfortunately, their meta-analysis did not focus on the characteristics of the autistic individuals, which, as seen above, have also been suggested to introduce variability in the findings. Finally, whilst Van der Hallen et al.\u2019s [ ] and Ferderici et al.\u2019s [ ] meta-analyses address the need for a summarisation and exploration of the variability in the results in the literature to a certain extent, their meta-analyses do not fully answer the questions about participant characteristics and their role in the existing findings. \n\nTo be able to understand what could drive potential behavioural differences, it is important to also review brain imaging literature for potential answers. There have been some previous attempts to summarise this literature. A meta-analysis on the fMRI investigation of ASD, which included studies on social perception in ASD, found differences between the ASD and NT groups in both basic social tasks such as face recognition and biological motion recognition, and in complex social tasks\u2014i.e. emotion recognition [ ]. However, within social perception, face perception was also included which limits the conclusions that can be made for the perception of only human movement. Similarly, a systematic review by Hamilton [ ] tried to summarise the electroencephalogram (EEG) literature on MNN and autism in BM observation, reporting that experiments probing the relationship between MNN and ASD have produced very mixed results. However, Hamilton [ ] does not provide a quantitative summary of the analysis, only a narrative one. \n\nSince there are inconsistencies in previous findings, behavioural, eye-tracking and brain imaging evidence will be reviewed to identify whether there is substantial evidence for decreased measures of performance in perceiving and understanding BM in individuals on the autism spectrum. We choose to focus solely on biological motion perception as body movement presents qualitatively and perceptually different information from faces and eye-gaze [ ]. Moreover, we want to minimise any inflation or deflation of the effect size of the difference between the two groups, which could be caused by the inclusion of faces and eye-gaze information, which in turn could limit the scope of interpretation. We include studies which have used videos of real humans performing movements, cartoons, which represent humans or human body parts (i.e. hands) (collectively termed full-light displays), and PLDs as described above. The inclusion of both behavioural and physiological measures will allow us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the differences between ASD and NT individuals. Where enough data were available (only in behavioural studies), we also investigate the effects of different contributing factors such as the age, sex and IQ of the participants, the quality of the studies and the effect different paradigms might have on the size and direction of the effect sizes. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Protocol \n  \nBefore commencing this meta-analysis, an informal protocol was agreed by all authors based on PRISMA guidelines [ ]. Following these guidelines, the protocol includes details about the methodology and the steps taken to collect and analyse the data, which were agreed prior to commencing this meta-analysis. Through discussions throughout the meta-analytic process and as problems arose, small changes were agreed upon by all authors, such as the exact analysis software, publication bias measures, age categories, etc. The changes are indicated within the protocol. The protocol is available upon request. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nIn order to identify eligible studies, we conducted a systematic literature search. The computerised search involved using the following electronic databases: Dissertations & Theses A&I (ProQuest), Dissertation & Theses: UK & Ireland (ProQuest), Web of Science, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost) and MEDLINE (OVID). The following search terms were used \u2018autis*\u2019, \u2018biological motion\u2019, \u2018human motion\u2019, \u2018asd\u2019, \u2018asperger*\u2019, \u2018childhood schizophrenia\u2019, \u2018kanner*\u2019, \u2018pervasive development* disorder*\u2019, \u2018PDD-NOS\u2019, \u2018PDD*\u2019, \u2018PLD*\u2019,\u2019point-light display*\u2019, \u201caction observation*\u201d, \u201caction observation network*\u201d, \u2018AON\u2019. The asterisk represents truncation, allowing the search to find items containing different endings of the term. Dissertations and Theses databases were searched in order to identify unpublished experiments in an attempt to minimise bias. The search was limited to results in English. Additional file   shows the search strategies used and the number of results the search returned. The search included a wide time span as no lower time criterion was imposed on the search engines allowing us to access the first available records. Results included records up to and including the first week of November 2017. A second search was done in May 2019 for any additional records, due to the substantial time that had passed from the initial search. \n\nThe following exclusion\/inclusion criteria were then used when screening the remaining records\u2019 abstracts and full text:\n   \nPublished before week one of November 2017(search 1) and May 2019 (search 2) \n  \nPublished primary empirical articles and theses with non-published results\u2014excluding review articles, opinion pieces, correspondences, case studies, and meta-analyses \n  \nParticipants in the sample must have an ASD diagnosis \n  \nDiagnosis must be confirmed through ADOS, ADI-R or a clinician \n  \n\n4.1 Added during review process: additional diagnostic measures such as the 3-Di, DISCO; those that are specific to Asperger\u2019s disorder, for example the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale (GADS, as cited in Price et al. [ ]), the Asperger Syndrome (and high functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI as cited in Price et al. [ ]) and the high-functioning Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ as cited in Price et al. [ ]) were also accepted as confirmation of ASD diagnosis. Additionally, the Chinese\/Japanese equivalents of tests were accepted as in Wang et al. [ ] and Fujisawa et al. [ ].\n   \nStudy must contain fMRI, EEG, eye-tracking and\/or behavioural designs \n  \nAn ASD and NT control group must be present and compared \n  \nAlthough human biological motion includes face motion and eye-gaze, only papers involving human body movement were included to provide a more focused review. These include full-light displays and PLDs \n  \nWhen stimuli that aim to minimise the availability of structural cues (e.g. PLDs) were used, the stimuli must represent human form with a minimum of two points for PLDs \n  \nStudies that used videos of people or cartoons where the face was not obstructed were not included as faces could confound with the participants\u2019 performance \n  \nPapers that focus on imitation of biological motion were not included \n  \nIf papers focusing on imitation included a separate analysis of BM observation, solely the BM observation was included where possible \n  \nSimilarly, if paradigms included additional stimuli, but performance on the BM paradigm was analysed and could be extracted separately from the other stimuli, only that analysis was included \n  \nOnly papers that included t-statistics, descriptive statistics and\/or effects sizes were included Data requests were made to authors, where eligible papers did not include the necessary data. \n  \n\nTwo reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts and full texts against the eligibility criteria. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by the two reviewers or by consultation with the third author. The final decisions on inclusion\/ exclusion of the studies were compared between the two reviewers. Cohen\u2019s Kappa at the first search was calculated which equated to 64.07%. However, since Cohen\u2019s Kappa is sensitive to distribution inequality [ ] and ~ 92% of the records were classified as false positives, the prevalence index (0.816) and the prevalence-adjusted kappa (PABAK) of inter-rater reliability were calculated (PABAK = 87.98% inter-rater reliability, absolute agreement = 93.99%). To minimise effort at the second search, inclusion\/exclusion was compared at abstract level and then at full-text level (Abstract level: Kappa = 70.72%, PABAK = 80.33%; Full-text: Kappa = 69.57%, PABAK = 71.43%) \n\nThe references of included records were screened by hand, split between the two reviewers. Five further records were identified. \n\n\n### Coding and data extraction \n  \nCoding of the studies was split between the first and second author. The studies were not double coded; however, the studies coded by the second author were double-checked by the first author. Papers were coded and data was extracted for the following variables:\n   \nSample size for each group \n  \nAge: Mean and Standard deviation were extracted for both the NT and ASD groups and each group was post-hoc classified into one of three age groups\u2014children (\u2264\u200913), adolescents (>\u200913 and \u2264\u200919) and adult (>\u200919) \n  \nFull-Scale IQ: Mean and standard deviation were extracted for both the NT and ASD groups \n  \nNon-verbal IQ: Mean and standard deviation were extracted for both the NT and ASD groups \n  \nSex ratio: the sex ratio for each group was extracted and transformed into the proportion of females present in the sample \n  \nParadigm: the type of paradigm used was extracted and categorised as 1\u2014Detection of biological motion in noise or in comparison to another stimulus (usually upside down or scrambled PLD) [ ,  ,  ]; 2\u2014Action and subjective states categorisation or recognition [ ,  ,  ]; 3\u2014Emotional states categorisation [ ,  ,  ]; 4\u2014Passive viewing (only relevant in fMRI, EEG and eye-tracking). What category each study falls in can be seen in Tables   and  . Although we initially attempted to separate detection in noise from recognition in comparison to other stimuli, the authors later decided that both tasks would require a similar process of integrating low level information into a coherent human form to perform the task. Thus, to create balanced categories and conceptually cohesive categories, the two categories were combined. \n  \nType of stimulus: the stimuli were grouped into two categories: 1\u2014PLDs; 2\u2014Full-light displays\u2014videos of real people or animations \n    \nSummary of studies \n  \n N   sample size,   FSIQ   full-scale IQ,   NVIQ   non-verbal IQ,   AR   action recognition,   D   BM detection or ,   ER   emotion recognition,   PV   passive viewing,   FLD   full-light display,   PLD   point-light display,   d'   sensitivity index,   g   Hedges\u2019   g  ,   var  .   g   estimated variance of   g  ,   SE  (  g  ) estimated standard error of   g  ,   WoE   weight of evidence,   SQA   standard quality assessment score \n\n Papers that only reported performance index (accuracy\/RT) or in addition to other findings \n    \nSummary of fMRI studies \n  \n N   sample size,   FSIQ   full-scale IQ,   NVIQ   non-verbal IQ,   AR   action recognition,   D   BM detection,   ER   emotion recognition,   PV   passive viewing,   WB   whole brain analysis,   FLD   full-light display,   SCR   scrambled BM,   COH   coherent dot motion,   PLD   point-light display,   WoE   weight of evidence,   SQA   standard quality assessment score,   L   left,   R   right,   IPL   inferior parietal lobule,   AG   angular gyrus,   FFG   fusiform gyrus,   IOG   inferior occipital gyrus,   MOG   middle occipital gyrus,   ITG   inferior temporal gyrus,   MTG   middle temporal gyrus, (p)  STS   (posterior) superior temporal sulcus, (med)SFG (medial)superior frontal gyrus,   IFG   inferior frontal gyrus,   MFG   middle frontal gyrus,   vlPC   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,   PTS   posterior temporal sulcus,   vmPC   ventromedial prefrontal cortex,   TPJ   temporo-parietal junction,   STG   superior temporal gyrus,   ACG   anterior cingulate gyrus,   score represents the total score obtained from the behavioural quality assessment plus a score given for the fRMI protocol,   score represents the relevant questions from the quality assessment measure + a score for the fMRI protocol \n  \n\nData on performance in the sense of descriptive statistics,   t   values or effect sizes (  d  ), were extracted from each paper. Effect sizes for thresholds, accuracy, sensitivity indices, error rates and reaction times were recorded from the behavioural studies. The areas of activation with contrasts of ASD > NT or NT > ASD were recorded from the fMRI studies and fixations or proportion of fixations were collected from the eye-tracking experiments. Eye-tracking studies included preferential looking paradigms in which percentage fixations were recorded as an indication of preference for one display, i.e. BM, over another, i.e. inverted BM. Differences in EEG-recorded activation between the NT and ASD groups were extracted from the EEG experiments, along with the specific frequencies and electrodes used. Additionally, the following variables were extracted to allow for a complete account of the included studies and quality assessment:\n   \nDiagnosis confirmation criteria \n  \nType and number per diagnosis category (where available) \n  \nAdditional diagnoses reported \n  \nVerbal IQ and other cognitive abilities that were not measured by a complete IQ assessment \n  \nLength of presented stimulus \n  \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nRisk of bias for behavioural, eye-tracking and EEG studies was assessed by two independent reviewers using the standard quality assessment (SQA) criteria for evaluating primary research papers from various fields for quantitative studies [ ]. The checklist contains 14 items. Items 5 (If interventional and random allocation was possible, was it described?), 6 (If interventional and blinding of investigators was possible, was it reported?), 7 (If interventional and blinding of subjects was possible, was it reported?) were not used as they refer to the use of interventions which are not applicable for the studies reviewed here. Each of the remaining 11 items can receive 2 points if the assessed study fulfils the criteria; 1 point if it partially fulfils the criteria and 0 points if it does not fulfil the criteria at all. A summary score was calculated for each paper by adding the total score and dividing it by the total possible score. The total score after excluding the previously mentioned three items is calculated with Eq.  . One study [ ] provided only descriptive information of results (no inferential statistics) and was judged on fewer items (Q1\u20134, Q8\u20139, Q13\u201314).\n \n\nEight studies were chosen at random to pilot the quality assessment. Disagreements were discussed and all papers were re-evaluated. An initial comparison was then done between the reviewers\u2019 scores. It was found that most disagreements were on item 12 (\u2018Controlled for confounding?\u2019). This item was discussed, and the papers were re-evaluated for that item. Disagreements of more than 3 points difference were further discussed on an item-by-item basis. Final comparison of all papers resulted in 18 papers upon which the reviewers completely agreed on the total score. There was no more than a two-point absolute difference between the reviewers\u2019 scores for the remaining papers. Thus, the scores for these papers were averaged across both reviewers. Differences between the two reviewers were mostly in the assignment of full or partial points for the items, which was also evident in the original piloting of the scales during its development [ ]. Overall, the disagreement between the reviewers in the quality score given to each study was quite low with small variability\u20140.038 (SD = 0.035, min-max [0\u20130.091]). In total, 47 papers were evaluated. The overall SQA score given to all papers was medium\/high\u20140.792 (SD = 0.065, min-max [0.636\u20130.955]). \n\nWe were unable to locate a standardised quality assessment measure that would allow us to assess the quality of fMRI papers. Thus, the assessment was done using relevant criteria from the SQA. Specifically, questions related to the analysis and results were excluded and the fMRI methodology was assessed for robustness. This was done collaboratively by the authors. \n\nFor the fMRI studies, which included an analysis of behavioural performance, the fMRI part of the analysis was disregarded initially, and the rest was assessed using the standard SQA procedure described above. This was done to provide a comparable score across the studies that incorporated behavioural performance and to allow for the inclusion of the quality measures as a predictor variable in the analysis. Afterwards, their fMRI protocols and analyses procedures were assessed for methodological robustness by the third and first author. The originally agreed upon score from the SQA was added to the score given for the methodological robustness and a new average quality score was calculated. For the fMRI papers that did not contain a behavioural paradigm, we used the relevant questions from the SQA (Q1\u2013Q4, Q9 and Q12\u2013Q14). Additionally, their protocols and analyses procedure were assessed for robustness. These scores were added and a composite score was given. Thus, it is important to underline that the quality scores for the fMRI papers are not directly comparable with the rest of the papers. The quality assessment scores for each study are presented in Tables   and  . \n\nAdditionally, in order to evaluate the quality of the evidence included, we have further conducted a weight of evidence analyses [ ]. The majority of shortcomings that were identified came from a non-randomised procedure or not including all sample characteristics. Details of this analysis are shown in Additional file  . It indicates that despite their shortcomings, the included studies provide good quality and relevant evidence in support of our conclusions. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe following analysis procedure was applied to the behavioural, eye-tracking and EEG experiments. For each included paper, the descriptive statistics,   t   values or Cohen\u2019s   d   were used to calculate Hedges\u2019   g   as the common representation of effect size for all studies. All the calculations and transformations were done by firstly calculating Cohen\u2019s   d   and its variance. A correction for small sample size was applied to get the unbiased estimate of Hedges\u2019   g  . The variance of   g   was estimated based on the sample sizes of each study. All the calculations were done using the R package   compute.es   [ ] in R(v3.4.1) [ ] and RStudio (v.1.1.453) [ ]. A precision index was calculated for each study as the inverse of the variance (1\/variance). Positive Hedges\u2019   g   corresponded to higher scores (better performance) in NT, when compared to ASD. Five top outlier outcomes were identified using a boxplot. An analysis of the initial model with and without the outliers showed that without the outliers, the variance between the studies reduced by a factor of 1.3 and the residual estimates reduced by a factor of five. Thus, all statistical analyses within this paper report the results without the outliers. \n\nSix studies provided RT data. Since a previous meta-analysis [ ] showed that RT outcomes tap into different processes in comparison to the rest of the extracted outcomes, they were analysed separately from the rest of the behavioural outcomes. Two top and one bottom outlier were identified using a boxplot. As above, the variance between the studies reduced without the outliers, and the residual estimate reduced by a factor of 3.6. Thus, all statistical analyses report the results without the outliers. \n\nSince papers rarely report only one outcome and\/or have only one experiment from which an effect size can be extracted, the traditional (two-level) meta-analysis is not appropriate due to the dependencies that come from using the same subjects or having the same researchers conduct the study [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, the analysis was extended to a three-level meta-analysis, which takes into account the variance due to the variation of the effect sizes included; the variance that occurs within the same study and the variance that occurs between the studies [ ]. Therefore, the three-level analysis estimates these three variance elements. The error only linear model with no moderators as given by Cheung [ ] is shown in Eq.  :\n \n\nWhere   g   is the effect size for outcome   j   from study   k   and is represented by Hedges\u2019   g  ;   \u03b1   is the grand mean of all effect sizes across studies;   u   represents the deviation of the average effect in study   k   from the grand mean;   u   is the deviation of effect   j   in study k from the average effect of study   k  ; and finally   e   is the residual variation not explained by the previously defined variances [ ]. This random effects model is then extended by including moderators. A series of meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of one or a combination of more than one of the following covariates: age, sex ratio, full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) for each group, as well as the paradigm and the stimuli. When moderators are added to the analysis, there are two sets of effect sizes that need to be kept in mind. The first set of effect sizes are the difference between ASD and NT at that level of the moderator (or combination of moderators). These are presented in Tables   and  . The second set of effect sizes are the ones which represent the size of the difference between the different levels. For example, a positive effect size will indicate that at the first level of the moderator, the difference between ASD and NT is larger than at the second level. Negative effect sizes here represent that there is a larger effect at the second\/third\/etc. level than at the previous level. \n\nThe parameter estimation was done using maximum likelihood, implemented in the mixed procedure in the statistical package SAS (release 9.04.01, [ ]). Due to the imbalance of studies when the predictor variables were added, the Satterthwaite method was used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom [ ]. Additionally, to investigate the effects at each level of the categorical variables, a least square means procedure was applied. \n\nTo assess heterogeneity, the   I   statistic [ ] was calculated. Since we are using a three-level analysis and potential heterogeneity can occur at the second or the third level, we used the modified formulas provided by Cheung [ ]. The   I   statistic was calculated only for the initial model, the model with the paradigm as a moderator and the model that included both paradigm and age as moderators. This was done because these three models contained the same studies and thus the effect of the moderators on the heterogeneity could be compared. The calculations for level 2   and level 3  are shown in Eq.   below.   and  represent the proportion of variation which can be attributed to the between and within studies respectively.\n \n\nWhere  is the between study variance calculated from the model,   is the within study variance calculated by the model and   is the typical within study variance calculated by Eq.   as suggested by Higgins ant Thompson [ ].\n \n\nWhere   w   is the inverse variance and   k   is the number of studies. \n\nPublication bias was assessed with Egger Regression [ ] and the Trim and Fill method [ ] using a two-level random effects model. The analysis was performed using a SAS macro created by Rendina-Gobioff and Kromrey [ ]. \n\n\n### ALE analysis of fMRI studies \n  \nTo analyse the fMRI data, activation likelihood estimation (ALE) in GingerALE v3.0.2 [ \u2013 ] was employed. Foci from the between group contrasts, which had reached statistical significance, were first extracted from the studies and converted where necessary into Talairach space using GingerALE. When both whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses were performed, and coordinates were available, the ones from the whole-brain analysis were used. In ALE, the activation foci are shown as a three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function, centred at the specified coordinates. The spatial overlap of these distributions across the different studies and the spatial uncertainty due to inter-subject and inter-experiment variability are then computed. This results in activation maps, which can be seen as summaries of the results of a specified study after considering the spatial uncertainty present. Through the combination of these maps, the convergence of activation patterns across studies can be calculated. This is confined to a grey matter shell and above chance clustering between the studies is calculated as a random-effects factor [ ]. We performed ALE analysis for the NT > ASD contrast only, since only two studies found differences at the ASD > NT contrast [ ,  ]. Only two studies [ ,  ] provided data for emotion detection\/identification paradigms, thus this was not analysed separately. Although, our initial intent was to investigate the effects of age, the small amount of studies that provided information about the differences between the ASD and the NT group would not allow for a separate investigation, without introducing spurious results and further complicating the mixed literature in the field. Thus, the readers should keep in mind that the ALE analysis and the output produced contains research from both children\/adolescents and adults as well as emotion and BM detection\/observation paradigms. Using the recommended thresholding procedure\u2014cluster defining threshold of 0.001 and cluster-wise family-wise error correction of 0.05, we were not able to identify any significant clusters. An exploratory analysis is reported where we used an uncorrected   p   value of 0.001 and maximum cluster size of 200 mm . \n\nData used for the analysis is deposited in a data repository, the link and reference to which will be added post acceptance, to allow for masked review. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe initial (November 2017) study search returned 793 records. The output from all databases was combined and duplicates were removed using two strategies. Initially, R software was used to remove duplicate records that appeared in the same format between the searches. Then, the articles were screened by hand to remove additional duplicates. This resulted in a total of 516 records. At the second search (May 2019), 124 records were identified and Rayyan software was used [ ]. Out of those 45 were identified as duplicates from the previous search and 18 were identified as duplicates between the databases. This resulted in a total of 61 records. \n\nThe selection process resulted in a set of 47 papers. Five further records were identified from the references of the included papers. From these 35 contributed to the behavioural studies category, five to the eye-tracking category, five to the EEG category and 11 to the fMRI category. An overview of the inclusion\/exclusion process is shown in the PRISMA flow diagram in Fig.   below.\n   \nPRISMA flow diagram representing the selection\/inclusion\/exclusion process  .   Adapted from Moher et al. [ ]. * Note that the second search did not look into Dissertation and Theses UK & Ireland, as it was covered by Dissertation and Theses Worldwide in the previous search \n  \n\nThe included studies and their descriptive information can be seen in Table   (behavioural, eye-tracking and EEG) and Table   (fMRI). The two tables also show the effect sizes for each study, their variance and standard error, their weight of evidence score and their quality assessment score. \n\nThis meta-analysis examined 52 papers, which contributed 80 (11 RT) behavioural effect sizes, seven eye-tracking effect sizes, 25 EEG effect sizes and 76 fMRI Foci. The sample size for the behavioural sample included 1742 subjects (ASD: 867, NT: 875). The complete eye-tracking sample included a total sample of 217 participants (ASD: 65, NT: 122). The EEG sample had a total sample of 170 participants (ASD: 75, NT: 95). The fMRI sample had a total sample of 483 participants (ASD: 234, NT: 249). Participant characteristics from all studies (including studies considered outliers in the analyses) are shown in Table  .\n   \nParticipant characteristics in each type of analysis \n  \n\n### Behavioural performance \n  \n####  O  verall \n  \nThe random effects three-level analysis of the overall sample revealed a mean estimated effect size   g   = 0.6639 [SE = 0.0923, 95% CIs 0.4759\u20130.8520]   t  (31.6) =7.2,   p   < 0.0001, which represents a medium effect [ ]. Overall, this suggests that ASD participants were less accurate, less sensitive or produced more errors when asked to detect or interpret biological motion in comparison to NT individuals. The between study variance (  u   = 0.1965 [SE = 0.072],   Z   = 2.73,   p   = 0.0032) and the within study variance (  u   = 0.0701 [SE = 0.07],   Z   = 1,   p   = 0.1584) show that variance occurred mostly between the studies. The heterogeneity at level 2 is   = 0.424, which argues for low to moderate heterogeneity and at the third level   = 0.0539, which falls under the category of low heterogeneity. The variance component was significant only between studies, indicating that the results varied more between than within studies, which mirrors the heterogeneity measures. It can be seen in Fig.   that the effect sizes of the studies and their confidence intervals cluster around the estimated effect size from the model, and only a few studies cross the line of no difference. Studies included in this analysis are as follows: [ \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ,  ].\n   \nForest plot showing the effect sizes (Hedge\u2019s g) from each study and its standard error as the error bars of the points. Different colours\/shapes represent the different age categories (red\/circle\u2014bellow or equal to 13; green\/triangle\u2014between 13 and 19; blue\/square\u2014older than 19) and the graph is split by paradigm. Solid line represents no effect; positive effect sizes represent instances where ASD participants performed worse than NT; dot-dashed line represents the effect size extracted from the initial model (  g   = 0.6639) \n  \n\n\n#### Quality \n  \nAn exploratory meta-analysis was run with the quality given to the studies using the quality assessment tool. However, there did not appear to be an effect of the quality of the studies on the results\u2014  F  (1,25.6) = 1.79,   p   = 0.1932. It has to be pointed out that most studies received quite high scores on the quality assessment measure, which could potentially explain the absence of an effect. However, the inclusion of quality did reduce the variation between the studies (  u   = 0.1754 [SE = 0.0696],   Z   = 2.52,   p   = 0.0058), despite slightly increasing the within-studies variance (  u   = 0.0753 [SE = 0.0767],   Z   = 0.98,   p   = 0.1631). For this reason, quality scores were added as a covariate within the rest of the analyses [ ]. For most cases, its inclusion either decreased covariance between the studies or had no qualitative effect. All studies from the overall analysis were included in this analysis. \n\n\n#### Stimuli \n  \nTo see whether the type of stimuli\u2014full-light or visually sparse (e.g. PLDs)\u2014had an effect on participant\u2019s performance, the stimuli type was added as a moderator variable. One paper included both full-light displays, and point light displays and thus was excluded [ ]. This reduced the number of effect sizes for this meta-analysis only from 64 to 63. The analysis showed that there was no overall effect of the type of stimulus used\u2014  F  (1,24.9) = 0.91,   p   = 0.3493. Additionally, the effects for full-light displays and PLDs were both significantly above 0\u2014  g   = 0.9055 [SE = 0.3055, 95% CIs 0.2759\u20131.5351]   t  (24.7) = 2.96,   p   = 0.0066 and   g   = 0.5842 [SE = 0.1006, 95% CIs 0.3778\u20130.7905]   t  (27) = 5.81,   p   < 0.0001, respectively. Full-light displays showed larger variance, potentially due to a smaller number of studies (  N   = 10). \n\n\n#### Paradigm \n  \nThere was an overall effect of the type of paradigm used\u2014  F  (2,61.5) = 8.70,   p   = 0.0005. There was a significant effect of each paradigm type as shown in Table  , indicating that participants with ASD performed worse than the NT in all paradigms. More interesting are the pairwise differences in performance between the paradigms. The difference in performance between the detection of coherent BM and action recognition\/categorisation was not significant (  g   = \u2212\u20090.0222 [SE = 0.1646, 95% CI \u2212\u20090.3511, 0.3067],   t  (63.8) = \u2212\u20090.13,   p   = 0.8933). However, there were significant differences between the detection of BM and emotion recognition\/categorisation (  g   = \u2212\u20090.5647 [SE = 0.1373, 95% CIs \u2212\u20090.8399, \u2212\u20090.2896],   t  (55.8) = \u2212\u20094.11,   p   = 0.0001), as well as between action recognition\/categorisation and emotion recognition\/categorisation (  g   = \u2212\u20090.5426 [SE = 0.1922, 95% CIs \u2212\u20090.9268, \u2212\u20090.1583],   t  (62.4) = \u2212\u20092.82,   p   = 0.0064). In both situations, ASD participants showed decreased performance in comparison to NT participants in the emotion recognition\/categorisation paradigms than in any of the other two. After the paradigm was added as a moderator, the variance reduced slightly at the between studies level (  u   = 0.1537) and disappeared at the within study level (  u   = 0). Similarly, the heterogeneity decreased from the initial model for level 2 and for level 3 (  = 0.3319 and   = 0). Finally, quality scores did not show a significant effect at this stage   F  (1,29) = 3.48,   p   = 0.0724. All studies from the overall analysis were included in this analysis.\n   \nSimple effects for each paradigm \n  \n1\u2014Detection of BM in noise and recognition in comparison to other stimuli; 2\u2014action recognition\/categorisation; 3\u2014emotion recognition\/categorisation.

A meta-analysis with paradigm and age showed no main effects of paradigm (  F  (2, 44.2) = 2.10,   p   = 0.1348) and no interaction between age and paradigm (  F  (2, 34.3) = 1.44,   p   = 0.2426). However, there was a significant main effect of age (  F  (2,29) = 3.35,   p   = 0.0492). Simple effects of each age group are reported in Table  . Visual representation of the effect sizes is shown in Fig.  , where the graph is separated by paradigm and the different age groups are colour\/shape coded. Note that only one effect was recorded for adolescents in the emotion category.\n   \nSimple effects for each age group \n  \nAge: 1\u2014\u2264\u200913, 2\u2014>\u200913 and \u2264\u200919, 3\u2014>\u200919.

However, there were significant differences in the effect size of the ASD-NT difference between children and adolescents (  g   = 0.5313 [SE = 0.2523, 95% CIs 0.01878, 1.0438],   t  (34.3) = 2.11,   p   = 0.0426) and between children and adults (  g   = 0.4528 [SE = 0.1881, 95% CIs 0.05998, 0.8457],   t  (19.7) = 2.41,   p   = 0.0260). The effects show that in both cases if the tested participants were children, the effects sizes were larger. \n\nAfter both age and the paradigm were added as moderators the variance between studies reduced even more, with again no variance being attributed to the third level (  u   = 0.0866 and   u   = 0). Furthermore, the heterogeneity was almost completely accounted for by the moderators (  = 0.1363 and   = 0). \n\nAdditionally, the quality scores showed a significant\u2014  F  (1,30.2) = 8.17,   p   = 0.0076, showing that with the increase of the quality of the study, the smaller the effects were. All studies from the overall analysis were included in this analysis. \n\n\n#### Sex \n  \nThe proportion of females in the samples of both ASD and NT participants was included as moderator variables in two smaller meta-analyses. Since several studies did not report information about sex, only 56 effect sizes from 27 studies were included in these analyses. The proportion of females in the ASD sample had no effect on the results (  F  (1, 33.2) = 0.11,   p   = 0.7454) nor did the proportion of females in the NT sample (  F  (1, 29.7) = 0.61,   p   = 0.4402). Studies included in this analysis are as follows: [ \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n#### Full-scale IQ \n  \nSimilar to sex, there were several studies that did not report FSIQ for one or both of the groups. For the ones that did report the FSIQ of both ASD and NT participants, FSIQ was also included as a moderator variable in two smaller meta-analyses. These included 18 studies and 30 effect sizes. There was no effect of FSIQ within the ASD sample (  F  (1, 15.9) = 0.02,   p   = 0.8889) nor was there an effect of FSIQ within the NT sample (  F  (1, 30) = 3.98,   p   = 0.0553). Studies included in this analysis are as follows: [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n#### Non-verbal IQ \n  \nOnly 14 studies and 18 effect sizes included the NVIQ for both the ASD and the NT group. Two smaller meta-analyses were performed using the NVIQ of each group as moderator variables; however, there were no significant effects neither for the ASD NVIQ (  F  (1,12.1) = 0.15,   p   = 0.7012) nor for the NT NVIQ (  F  (1,11.3) = 0.00,   p   = 0.9921). Studies included in this analysis are as follows: [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n\n### Publication Bias \n  \nTo evaluate the possibility of a publication bias, we plotted the behavioural effect sizes against their standard error with a funnel plot (see Fig.  ) [ ,  ]. As can be seen by their distribution, there is a wide variety of effect sizes with similar standard errors. Specifically, there appears to be a lack of effect sizes with high standard errors and low effect sizes and low standard errors with high effect sizes, which stems from the relatively small to moderate sample sizes in the studies. The inverted funnel shape, which extends 1.96 standard errors around the overall estimate, should include 95% of the studies. However, one of the assumptions for that interpretation is that the true effect is the same in each study [ ]. It is evident from Fig.   that 95% of the studies do not fall within the funnel shape. However, we do not make the assumption that the treatment effect is the same in each study. Moreover, we show that the effects vary with age and paradigm. Finally, it is possible that additional variability is added due to the heterogeneous nature of the ASD population.\n   \nFunnel plot for the behavioural studies. Displays the effect size\u2014Hedge\u2019s g, plotted against the standard error. The vertical line represents the effect size from the overall analysis \n  \n\nBesides visual inspection of the funnel plot, the Egger regression method [ ] was used to assess the possibility of bias using a random effects model. Egger\u2019s regression detected a risk of publication bias\u2014  t   = 2.5806,   p   = 0.0122. Specifically, there is slight asymmetry in the lower end of the funnel plot, where larger standard errors produced larger effect sizes. For this reason, the Trim and Fill method from Duval and Tweedie [ ] was used. Using a standard random effects model, the analysis indicates publication bias in the right tail of the funnel plot, indicating that more studies were published with large effect sizes and large standard errors. This was mirrored by the direction of the effect found in the meta-analysis including the quality assessment scores. \n\n\n### Reaction time \n  \nThe random effects three-level analysis of the overall RT sample revealed a mean estimated effect size   g   = 0.384 [SE = 0.1828, 95% CIs \u2212\u20090.037\u20130.8055]   t  (8) = 2.1,   p   = 0.0689, which represents a small effect [ ]. Overall, this suggests that ASD participants showed non-significantly slower RT in the BM paradigms in comparison to NT individuals. There was no between study variance (  u   = 0) or within study variance (  u  = 0), thus heterogeneity was not calculated. With the removal of outliers, there were only eight effect sizes left, and further moderation analyses were not run [ ]. Figure  a shows the distribution of effect sizes for the reaction time paradigms. Studies included in this analysis are as follows: [ ,  ,  ,  ].\n   \nForest plots showing the effect sizes (Hedge\u2019s g) from each study and its standard error as the error bars of the points. Different colours\/shapes represent the different age categories (red\/circle\u2014bellow or equal to 13; green\/triangle\u2014between 13 and 19; blue\/square\u2014older than 19) and the graph is split by paradigm. Solid line represents no effect; positive effect sizes represent instances where ASD participants performed worse than NT; dot-dashed line represents the effect sizes extracted from the initial model.   a   Reaction time data (  g   = 0.384),   b   eye-tracking data (  g   = 0.917) and   c   EEG data (  g   = 0.642) \n  \n\n\n### Eye-tracking \n  \nAs there were only five papers that provided enough information to extract data about effect sizes in eye-tracking experiments, a meta-regression with moderators was not conducted. The five studies contributed a total of seven effect sizes. The overall analysis revealed a mean estimated effect size   g   = 0.9172 [SE = 0.4865, 95% CIs \u2212\u20090.3552, 2.1896],   t  (4.73) = 1.89,   p   = 0.1214, which represents a large effect, but non-significant [ ]. Overall, this means that ASD participants showed less preference for biological motion in comparison to NT individuals; however, it should be noted that it was not significant, which is predicated by the broad confidence intervals around the estimate. The between study variance (  u   = 1.0862 [SE = 0.7841],   Z   = 1.39,   p   = 0.083) and the within study variance (  u   = 0.0) showed that variance occurred mainly between studies, which was expected due to the small number of studies. However, none were significant indicating consistency between the studies\u2019 results and the results within studies. It is important to point out that due to the small number of studies and the large confidence intervals, these results should be taken with caution. Figure  b shows the distribution of effect sizes for the eye-tracking paradigms. All studies reported in Table   under the eye-tracking subheading are included. \n\n\n### EEG \n  \nThere were 25 effect sizes provided by five studies. The overall effect size revealed by the analysis was not significant\u2014  g   = 0.6489 [SE = 0.3271, 95% CIs \u2212\u20090.02476, 1.3226],   t  (25) = 1.98,   p   = 0.0584. Similar to the eye-tracking results, this showed a medium effect size but due to the small sample size, and the fact that one study contributed 17 of the effect sizes, it is expected that the large confidence intervals would overlap with 0. There was no between or within study variance\u2014  u   = u   =   0. Figure  c shows the distribution of effect sizes for the EEG paradigms. Due to the variability that is seen in the frequency that is used, an exploratory analysis, which looks at frequency as a contributing factor to the EEG findings, is reported in Additional file  . All studies reported in Table   under the EEG subheading are included. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \nThe 11 studies that investigated the difference between ASD and NT participants covered emotion recognition and distinguishing between coherent BM PLD and scrambled PLD\/fixation baseline or coherently moving dots. Due to the small sample of studies and the fact that two studies did not find any significant brain areas, and one study only found difference in the ASD > NT contrast, all studies were analysed together for the NT > ASD contrast. Only Koldewyn et al. [ ] and Jack et al. [ ] found differences where ASD participants showed significantly higher activated regions when compared to NT. Since these were the only two studies to show this contrast, no further analysis was done for the ASD > NT contrast. This led to the inclusion of eight studies (62 foci). Due to the small number of included studies, we used the uncorrected   p   values at a level of 0.001 and a minimum cluster size of 200 mm . Table   and Fig.   present the results from the NT > ASD comparison. Five clusters were identified where the NT participants showed greater activation than the ASD participants. In the left hemisphere, one cluster peaked at the left uncus, Brodmann area (BA) 20, and one at the middle cingulate gyrus (MCG), BA 24. The remaining regions were in the right hemisphere, where one region peaked at the middle occipital gyrus (MOG) (BA 19), one region at the superior temporal gyrus (STG) (BA 41) and one cluster with two peaks at the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the Inferior Temporal Gyrus (BA 41 and 39 respectively). The resulting map overlays were produced on a standardised structural scan using Mango v4.1 [ ] (rii.uthscsa.edu\/mango).\n   \nRegions with significantly elevated activation likelihood from the ALE analysis \n  \n BA   Brodmann area,   STG   superior temporal gyrus,   MTG   middle temporal gyrus,   ITG   inferior temporal gyrus,   MOG   middle occipital gyrus,   MCG   middle cingulate gyrus,   R   right,   L   left \n    \nBrain area activation from ALE analysis.   a   Uncus.   b   Central gyrus.   c   Superior temporal gyrus.   d   Middle occipital gyrus.   e   Inferior temporal gyrus.   f   Middle temporal gyrus \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate whether ASD individuals show differences in their ability to perceive and interpret biological motion when compared to NT individuals. This question has been under discussion for decades and contradicting results have continuously appeared in the literature. Therefore, a quantitative summary of the results was necessary to allow research to move forward in understanding the atypicalities present in ASD. The current study investigated several potential factors that could contribute to the variable and often mixed results in this field. We explored the possibility of different paradigms being a reason for these varied findings and the effect of age, sex and IQ on participants\u2019 performance. \n\nThis meta-analysis showed that there is a medium effect indicating an overall decreased performance in perceiving and interpreting biological motion for ASD individuals. Specifically, the present findings show that individuals with autism show lower levels of performance when higher order information, such as emotion, is required to be extracted from biological motion. Moreover, age is a significant contributing factor to the variability of the results, as different age groups show different degrees of performance decrement. Additionally, we did not find a significant effect in reaction time data, suggesting no delays responding to stimuli once recognised. Further, the effect size of the eye-tracking results would argue that autistic individuals do not attend to or orient towards BM. However, the small sample of studies and its variability lead to a non-significant estimated effect size, even though the effect size would be constituted as \u2018large\u2019. This variability is evident in the distribution of the study effect sizes around the average effect size. Thus, the absence of significance in the eye-tracking results may possibly be mainly attributed to the small sample. A similar pattern is seen from the EEG studies. Finally, the five clusters identified in the fMRI ALE analysis to show higher activation for NT than ASD individuals provide evidence for a potential neural basis for the difference in BM perception abilities. \n\n### Differences in performance increase with the increase in task complexity \n  \nBiological motion can convey various types of information. It can provide simple information about what others around us are doing, or more complex information, for example about the emotional state of others [ ,  ]. All this information is of great importance in social interaction. Although, Koldewyn et al. [ ] argue that individuals with ASD can perceive\/detect biological motion, we found a general decreased performance in the perception of BM in ASD individuals in all paradigms, including simple BM detection. Moreover, there was no difference in performance between BM detection and action recognition. This indicates that although biological motion detection requires simple integration of motion elements, decreased performance at this level already exists, hindering recognition. Furthermore, the effect size of the difference between the NT and ASD individuals was about twice the size when emotion recognition paradigms were employed. Thus, aligned with Koldewyn et al.\u2019s [ ] arguments, there is in fact decreased performance when the extraction of emotion information is required but this would manifest on top of the already existing decreased performance with simple detection of BM. Similar findings were also observed by Federici et al. (41), where inferring higher order information from PLDs showed larger effects. This is an expected finding since ASD is defined with difficulties in social interaction and communication. Emotion recognition is a highly social process, making it more cognitively demanding than BM identification which would rely on perceptual decisions. The effect of paradigm in our meta-analysis may be because emotion adds an additional layer of social complexity in comparison to simple BM identification or action recognition, making it more difficult for individuals with ASD to perform on such tasks. This difference between the two groups is true even when simple and complex emotional recognition tasks are used ([ ,  \u2013 ], but see [ ]). \n\nIt is worth noting that we did not find significant effects when reaction time was the measured outcome. Even more, the effect size that we found would be considered small according to Cohen\u2019s [ ] characterisations. Although, a recent meta-analysis has shown that global information integration takes time in autism, which is evident in slower reaction times [ ], this is not evident in biological motion perception. A possible explanation is that motion introduces an additional factor, which is suggested by reported higher motion thresholds in autism [ ,  ]. Moreover, biological motion perception has longer spatiotemporal integration windows than simple motion stimuli, which could make it more difficult to detect small differences in reaction time [ ]. Thus, the decreased performance in perceiving biological motion is a combination between motion and the social factor of human movement, which is more evident in interpretation, rather than in time taken for processing. \n\nThis finding, that different paradigms introduce varying effect sizes emphasises that when the research community is trying to explain differences between NT and ASD individuals, it cannot simply talk about biological motion perception as a whole. Instead, the nuances that different paradigms bring need to be emphasised. Moreover, the different paradigms are not comparable; instead they provide different levels of understanding of the abilities of individuals with ASD. \n\n\n### Differences between ASD and NT individuals decrease with age \n  \nThe developmental course of BM perception in ASD is critically important, especially since so many contradicting results have been found between different age groups [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Overall, it appears that the size of the difference between the two groups is larger when children are investigated. On the other hand, the effect size when adults were studied did not differ from the effect size when adolescents were studied. \n\nOur findings imply that ASD individuals tend to catch up with age and that performance within ASD becomes more aligned with the NT population. This in turn corresponds to the general improvement with age observed within NT individuals [ ]. Despite this catch up however, the size of the differences between the two groups was significant at every age category, indicating consistent difference in performance but to a varying degree dependent on age. Thus, whilst NT and ASD tend to both improve in their ability to detect BM, ASD individuals do so at a slower rate. This implies the existence of a developmental delay in the extraction of relevant social information from biological motion. It should be noted that Annaz et al. [ ] also did not find a relationship with age in children with ASD for non-biological motion coherence and form-from-motion paradigms, whereas the effect was present in NT individuals. Thus, it appears that there might be a global delay in motion coherence sensitivity in ASD. Although, Simmons et al. [ ] argue for inconsistency in the literature about motion coherence and ASD, elevated motion coherence thresholds have been found by others (e.g. [ ,  ]). Moreover, Van der Hallen et al.\u2019s [ ] findings suggest specifically that there is an overall decreased performance in global motion perception in individuals with ASD, for both coherent and biological motion. \n\nTo sum, the variability in the behavioural findings in the literature can be explained largely by the fact that ASD participants cannot be put together as a single group. As well as talking about the nuances that individual paradigms bring, we need to distinguish between the different age groups. Thus, a study aiming to investigate performance in adults should not look for effects as large as the ones found in children, as they are statistically not comparable. \n\n\n### No effect of sex, FSIQ and NVIQ on performance on BM paradigms \n  \nIt has been suggested that ASD is expressed differently in males and females and that females could be the source of variability in some of the results related to performance in the ASD literature [ ]. However, we did not find any significant effects of the proportion of females in either the NT or ASD sample. Furthermore, neither the FSIQ nor the NVIQ of either group revealed a significant effect on the overall performance. Although some studies have argued for [ ,  ] and against [ ,  ,  ] the effects of IQ, those that find effects usually have lower IQ scores in comparison to the ones that do not find this effect (but see ref [ ]). The mean FSIQ in the current meta-analysis was also higher\u2014with averages in the behavioural, eye-tracking and fMRI designs falling between 103 and 112. Thus, it is possible that any variability that may be explained from an IQ perspective might not have been captured in this analysis or in studies where the IQs are above 100. Thus, the present findings may not necessarily be transferable to ASD individuals at the lower end of the IQ distribution. However, since research is usually done on individuals of average or above average IQ, this nuance would not be captured unless more research is adapted and done with individuals on the lower side of the IQ distribution. \n\n\n### Brain and behaviour \n  \nFrom a brain imaging perspective, we aimed to investigate both EEG and fMRI. This was driven by the fact that it has been suggested that individuals with ASD utilise different brain networks when observing biological motion [ ]. \n\nEEG studies, which usually rely on mu-suppression as a proxy for the MNN in ASD, argue for an impaired mirror system in autism [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Specifically, they have consistently found reduced mu-suppression in central electrodes. Similar findings have been indicated by a meta-analysis conducted by Fox et al. [ ]. However, we did not find a significant effect for the difference between ASD and NT individuals. There are two possible explanations for this result. One possibility is that the effect sizes were too small to be considered significantly different from 0. This, however, does not seem to be the case, as there is a good distribution of results on both sides of the no-difference line. The second possibility is that the small sample of studies did not provide enough data points to allow for a stable estimate to be given. This is especially evident by the lower bound of the 95% CI for the overall effect size, as it stays very slightly below 0. Furthermore, the exploratory analysis, which is reported in Additional file  , showed that depending on the frequency used to perform the analysis, the effect size can differ greatly. Thus, for some conclusion to be made from the EEG studies, a common analysis structure needs to be agreed upon. However, Hamilton [ ] argues that support for a difference from these studies is weak and mixed, which also speaks for the unreliable findings. Moreover, it has been argued that mu suppression findings can be unreliable as they are very much dependent on the baseline that is chosen [ ]. Although some of the studies identified here used the same paradigm with the same baseline [ ,  ,  ], this was not the case for all of them [ ,  ], which makes it difficult to compare the findings. Thus, a general standard for data analysis and what constitutes as a baseline needs to be set before any conclusions can be drawn. \n\nFrom an fMRI perspective, we investigated the differences in brain activation between ASD and NT in biological motion perception and emotion recognition. It is noteworthy that emotion perception and BM observation paradigms were analysed together, due to the small sample size. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify significant clusters that overlapped between the studies. However, the exploratory analysis showed that by using a more relaxed threshold, the areas that come up as different between the two groups correspond to the areas that have been identified in the biological motion perception literature. \n\nIn short, we found five clusters where NT individuals showed greater activation than ASD individuals: the left uncus, left middle cingulate gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus and one cluster peaking at the right superior and middle temporal gyri. These findings are consistent with literature showing right hemisphere dominance in the processing of biological motion [ ,  ]. Particularly, the right ITG and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) have been observed to be specifically implicated in the observation of human motion [ \u2013 ]. Additionally, the ITG has been found to be part of the BM processing network of NT in McKay et al.\u2019s [ ] experiment but not in ASD, which corresponds to our findings. Similarly, the MTG is related to the perception of human movement. Peelen and Downing [ ] argue that the MTG is part of the extrastriate body area (EBA) and that its activation during action observation is due to it representing the shape and posture of the body rather than the action. Additionally, Thompson and Baccus [ ] argue that motion and form make independent contributions to the processing of biological motion in the MT areas. Specifically, the MT areas respond a lot more to the motion aspects, and EBA to the representation of human form. However, since these areas overlap [ ] and the observed cluster in these results peaked at MTG and ITG, it could be expected that the activation is due to an interplay between the motion and human form information. This collaborative mechanism has previously been suggested by Downing and Peelen [ ]. If individuals with ASD have problems perceiving the basic human shape and posture, it is understandable why there appeared to be consistent differences in behavioural performance between ASD and NT individuals in all biological motion paradigms investigated here. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, with the increased motion thresholds found within individuals with ASD [ ], it could be expected that impairments would come from both motion and human form detection. \n\nInterestingly, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a region that has been implied to be important in biological motion perception [ ,  ]; however, we did not find higher STS activation in NT in comparison to ASD. Nevertheless, we did find the superior temporal gyrus (STG) to have higher activation in NT. Previous findings [ ,  ,  ] have argued that the STS is involved in social perception, namely it integrates the social context with the actor\u2019s actions. Nevertheless, McKay et al. [ ] also did not find the STS to be involved in simple biological motion perception. Since their paradigm is similar to the paradigms used in the papers, which dominated in the present analysis, it fits that we also did not find STS activation. However, the proximity of the STG to the STS suggests that there might be some potential overlap which could be driven by the inclusion of the emotion-related BM paradigms in the analysis. In fact, the STG has been found to show activation when observing emotional biological motion and in biological motion perception paradigms in general [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nDespite both the low number of studies which were included in the ALE analysis and the exploratory nature of the results, the brain areas found were consistent with BM processing literature. Moreover, differences in these brain areas can and do show differences in behaviour. This finding emphasises the connection between brain differences and behavioural performance. However, due to the small number of studies and the fact that a more constrained threshold did not show any significant values, some caution needs to be taken when interpreting these results. \n\n\n### Methodological limitations \n  \nThe quality of a meta-analysis is only as high as the quality of the studies that it includes. The studies that we included received a relatively high score on our quality assessment measure with little variance between the studies. The major methodological issues of the included studies were the small sample sizes and the fact that on several occasions there were no corrections for multiple comparisons. However, the correction for multiple comparisons should not have affected our results as we used the descriptive or test statistics, rather than the   p   values. Nevertheless, it was evident in the behavioural analysis that the quality of the studies played a significant role in reducing variability and allowing for better interpretability of the statistical results. This indicates that small changes in the quality of a study contributed enough to influence the results. Specifically, it appeared that the higher the quality of a study, the smaller the effect size was; indicating that better controlled studies produced smaller effect sizes. The same finding was observed by the publication bias analysis, which showed that studies with smaller standard errors produced smaller effect sizes. This on its own is an important discovery about the control that is used when developing a study paradigm. It is possible that with a better controlled study, larger amounts of variability are controlled, reducing any additional external effects. Thus, future autism researchers should aim to provide even more methodologically sound results, to allow them to distinguish between external heterogeneity and within-ASD heterogeneity. \n\nAdditionally, in our criteria ,we aimed to include studies that utilised either the gold standard (i.e. ADOS plus ADI; see [ ]) or expert clinical opinion when confirming the ASD diagnosis of their participants. However, during the selection process, we realised that a number of studies did not employ the gold standard and rather used various diagnostic measures. For that reason, we expanded our inclusion criteria to include at least some form of diagnosis confirmation. Worryingly, one of the reasons that studies were not included in the present analysis was that the diagnosis was not confirmed by any means, let alone by using the gold standard. However, the concept of a gold standard is a matter of debate [ ] and it has been noted that the scales do not always capture individuals that have been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome [ ]. Thus, how ASD participants ought to be identified in future studies needs to be explored. \n\nFurthermore, even though it is argued that a quantitative summary on two effect sizes is better than simple counts of positive vs. negative effects [ ], statistical analysis, and the confidence one can give to it, is proportionally dependent to its sample size. Although the three-level model has allowed us to utilise more than one effect size per study, thus increasing the number of cases included, the resulting sample is still small, especially for some of the categories of analysis. This is mainly true for the EEG analysis, where one study provided most of the effect sizes. Thus, when interpreting the results from this meta-analysis, the number of studies in each part needs to be considered. Furthermore, the number of effect sizes that we were able to include in some of the analyses (eye-tracking, RT, EEG and fMRI) did not allow us to investigate important factors such as paradigm and age. This unfortunately limits our ability to interpret the effect of those factors. Nevertheless, if we look at the behavioural results, then we can conjecture that these factors will be important and will also need to be considered, when new paradigm designs are considered, or when interpreting the overall weight of the effects found in the literature. \n\nFinally, we included studies from unpublished sources, such as dissertations and theses in an attempt to reduce the chances of a publication bias. Nevertheless, most of these unpublished sources were significant. However, this does not exclude the \u2018file drawer effect\u2019 where non-significant findings are likely to not be published. It is also possible that the Egger regression method is capturing other types of bias, for example the heterogeneity between the studies themselves, which is expected due to the ASD population being heterogeneous [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions and future directions \n  \nOverall, it appears that individuals with ASD show lower performance measures than NT individuals on tasks involving the detection and interpretation of BM. However, age and the type of paradigm used have a great influence on the size of the difference between ASD individuals\u2019 performance and the performance of NT individuals. We show that there is a developmental delay in BM understanding, which improves with age within the ASD population and explains the high variability in the results established in the literature. Moreover, autistic individuals show consistently lower performance in paradigms requiring the extraction of emotion from BM in comparison to action recognition or simple BM detection. This finding is more meaningful, considering that a main characteristic of ASD is an impairment in social communication and that interaction and emotional portrayal of biological motion has great social relevance. Finally, we find that there appear to be differences between ASD and NT groups in brain activations when viewing BM and those differences can provide an insight to why the behaviour that we observe exists. \n\nFor the field of research to move forward, methodological standards need to be imposed in terms of the age ranges incorporated, and the types of paradigms used. However, interpretation standards need to be considered as well. Although it appears that there is variability in the literature as to whether and how large the effects are, the effects are actually varied due to the combination of various factors. For proper interpretation of the field, the paradigm used and the age of the participants need to be considered as segregating factors. This is important because a child with autism might have difficulty perceiving biological motion, but by the time they reach adulthood, that effect might have subsided. Similarly, individuals with autism might find it much more difficult to extract emotion information from human movement, but they are much better at describing non-affective actions. Finally, as a field, autism research is going to find heterogeneous findings, due to the innate variability between autistic individuals. However, sound methodological principles when developing studies will reduce that variability and allow for better consistency and easier interpretation. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6921539,"text_md5":"dacb136e2f06dfe25b89b2f4c3186cfc","field_positions":{"authors":[0,89],"journal":[90,100],"publication_year":[102,106],"title":[117,190],"keywords":[204,286],"abstract":[299,1736],"body":[1745,79938]},"batch":2,"pmid":31890147,"doi":"10.1186\/s13229-019-0299-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6921539","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6921539"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6921539\">6921539<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6921539  Biological motion perception in autism spectrum disorder: a meta-analysis"}

There is an ongoing debate regarding the belief that people from Eastern cultures possess greater self-control abilities when compared to people from Western cultures. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm to compare 30 studies (719 subjects, 373 foci) that used fMRI to investigate the performance in Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks of participants from Western and\/or Eastern countries. Our meta-analysis found differences between the networks activated in Eastern and Western culture participants. The right prefrontal cortex showed distinct patterns, with the Inferior Frontal gyrus more active in the Eastern group and the middle and superior frontal gyri more active in the Western group. Our findings suggest that Eastern culture subjects have a higher tendency to activate brain regions involved in proactive inhibitory control, while Western culture subjects rely more on reactive inhibitory brain regions during cognitive control tasks. This implies that proactive inhibition may play a crucial role in promoting the collective and interdependent behavior typical of Eastern cultures, while reactive inhibition may be more important for efficient cognitive control in subjects of Western cultures that prioritize individualism and independence. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nCulture is a significant factor in shaping our attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, impacting everything from our communication styles to our decision-making processes and perceptions of the world. While it is evident that individuals from different cultures exhibit inhomogeneous and sometimes peculiar behaviors and cognitive processes, the underlying neural mechanisms behind these differences remain largely unknown. Although studies have explored cultural differences in various psychological processes, it is still unclear whether these differences are governed by the same or different neural networks. However, research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has identified multiple neural circuits that are involved in different psychological processes [ , ]. \n\nIt is commonly believed that individuals from Eastern cultures have a greater capacity for inhibitory control than those from Western cultures, and this idea is a subject of ongoing debate. Research in cultural psychology indicates that there are differences in inhibitory control between individualistic, as are typically considered Western cultures, and collectivistic, as are typically considered Eastern cultures [ , , , , ]. This is likely to be associated with the Eastern philosophy, which conveys the message of the importance of self-control and inner discipline that underlies a collectivist type of culture, where the group and society are very important. \n\nThe basic idea is that what is good for society is also good for the individual, and a balance between individual and society is achieved by modulating self-control through inhibitory abilities [ , , ]. From an early age, Eastern education systems adopt strict parenting and parenting practices that are believed to stimulate and strengthen inhibitory control [ , , ]. Indeed, in studies conducted during early childhood, children aged three to four years old from East Asian nations often demonstrate greater proficiency in measures of inhibitory control, including the Stroop task, when compared to their American counterparts [ , ]. Although it is likely that the difference between people of Western and Eastern cultures may be related to the extent and type of brain regions activated for self-control, when one compares fMRI studies in subjects belonging to the two types of culture, there is a lack of consistency in the neural areas responsible for the respective inhibitory control [ , , , , ]. \n\nThis inconsistency can be attributed to various factors and differences, including the chosen paradigms. In fact, while inhibitory control has been mainly assessed using the Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks interchangeably, these two tasks seem to tackle differently inhibitory components [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. \n\nThere are other relevant factors worth taking into consideration, such as the participants\u2019 ages [ ] or education levels [ ]. Notably, to control for education, it may be useful to also control for cultural proficiency. Inadequate cultural knowledge and\/or adaptation have been linked to decreased performance in tasks that require inhibitory control, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [ ] and the Stroop test [ , ]. Conducting a meta-analysis on the data obtained from previous studies could better clarify the implications of the various circuits in the modulation of cognitive control as a function of the two cultures. As far as we know, no meta-analysis has been carried out to investigate the potential variations in neural correlates associated with inhibitory control in Western and Eastern cultures. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Western and Eastern cultures on the neurobiological underpinnings of inhibitory control while controlling for variables that may affect inhibition, such as task design [ ], aging [ ], and education [ ]. \n\nTo this end, we conducted a meta-analysis and compared 30 studies that used fMRI to investigate the Go\u2013Nogo and Stop Signal Tasks in Western and\/or Eastern participants using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm. Since our primary goal was to explore the brain mechanisms underlying inhibitory control in these cultural contexts, rather than focusing on the differences in behavioral outcomes, we took steps to minimize confounding effects by exclusively analyzing volumes derived from trials where inhibition was successfully achieved and by carefully matching the two groups based on the task design. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria \n  \nWe conducted a systematic and comprehensive literature search to select relevant fMRI studies published up to April 2022 using the databases   PubMed   ( \u2014accessed on 8 April 2022) and   Web of Science   ( \u2014accessed on 8 April 2022). The selected keywords were combined using the Boolean operators AND and OR. The   PubMed   search input was: (\u201cStop-Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cStop Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cGo-NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGoNoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo\/NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo No-Go\u201d) AND fMRI. The   Web of Science   search input was: TS = ((\u201cStop-Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cStop Signal Task\u201d OR \u201cGo-NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGoNoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo\/NoGo\u201d OR \u201cGo No-Go\u201d) AND fMRI). Additional studies were searched from the references of all identified publications. Eligibility was determined via a two-step procedure performed by four of the authors (GG, CN, VB, and MC). First, the titles and abstracts of all identified articles were screened. In the second step, the full texts of studies, according to predefined eligibility criteria, were independently examined, and agreement was reached after discussion. Our study was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ ]. \n\nThe studies were considered eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) whole-brain analysis performed on fMRI data (we excluded studies conducted using positron emission tomography and fMRI in which only results from ROI analysis were reported); (2) availability of coordinates of activation foci clearly provided either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space; (3) studies conducted on healthy adults. Exclusion criteria: studies conducted on children or the elderly; studies using stimuli with emotional content, reward, or other inhibitory tasks; studies with pharmacological treatment or training; non-standard neuroimaging data analysis or procedures. The selection of these strict criteria allowed us to select homogeneous studies in order to obtain more robust measures [ ]. From the pool of potentially eligible studies, we performed further selection in order to identify studies for the comparison (quantitative analysis) between studies on Western vs. Eastern culture matched for the type of experimental paradigm (SST and GoNogo) and participant characteristics (age and education level). See   for details on culture studies included in the Eastern or Western groups of studies. \n\n\n### 2.2. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) \n  \nData were analyzed using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis algorithm implemented in GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ). ALE is a coordinate-based meta-analysis method that uses peak coordinates from functional studies as inputs, and has been described well in previous methodological papers [ , , , ]. The ALE algorithm assesses the convergence of activation foci from different neuroimaging studies, modeled as probability distributions, against null distributions of random spatial associations, while controlling for sample size. To minimize within-experiment effects, the non-additive algorithm described in Turkeltaub et al. [ ] was applied. Inference was made at the cluster level, as this provides the best balance between sensitivity and specificity [ ]. The cluster-forming threshold was set to   p   < 0.005, and the size of the resulting supra-threshold clusters was compared to a null distribution determined by 2000 permutations of the data (with a threshold of   p   < 0.05). The selected studies are outlined in  . \n\nThe first two meta-analyses were performed with the activation foci generated by the Go\u2013Nogo and the SST, and were divided into two (Eastern culture and Western culture) groups of studies. To further examine the shared and differential neural substrates during the inhibition task, the two groups of studies (Eastern culture vs. Western culture) were analyzed. A conjunction analysis was performed to assess the potential overlap among the brain networks from the Western and Eastern culture groups, and a pairwise subtraction analysis was used to identify the differences in activation between these two networks [ ]. The analysis was conducted with a statistical threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.01 and 10,000 permutations, and a cluster-size threshold of 200 mm . \n\nThe neuroanatomical coordinates reported in Talairach space [ ] were transformed to MNI space for all analyses. Whole-brain maps of the thresholded ALE images were visualized in Mango V.4.0.1 ( ), an anatomical image overlay program, superimposed onto a standardized anatomical template. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Results of the Study Search \n  \nA PRISMA flow chart of the article selection process is illustrated in  . Our search yielded 597 potentially eligible studies. After evaluation of the full text of these articles, 73 studies were potentially eligible. This pool of studies included 14 Eastern and 59 Western studies. In fact, we considered 15 studies from Eastern cultures, because one study ( ) presented data with both SST and GoNogo tasks. In order to perform a balanced comparison, a subset of 15 Western studies matching the Eastern group for type of experimental design (SST and GoNogo) and participant characteristics (age and education level) was extracted. Therefore, 30 studies (15 from Eastern culture countries and 15 from Western culture countries) from 2003 to 2022 were included in our quantitative analyses. From these studies, a cumulative number of 719 healthy subjects and 373 foci were obtained. The main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis are reported in the  . \n\n\n### 3.2. ALE Results \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis of the group of studies from Eastern countries ( ;  ) identified the largest cluster size (7408 mm ) in the right cerebral hemisphere extending from the striatum, the claustrum, the caudate, the insula, and the inferior frontal gyrus and comprising small portions of the right precentral gyrus, putamen, and globus pallidus. The second cluster (2232 mm ) included the right striatum and the claustrum, followed by a cluster (1752 mm ) located in the right middle frontal gyrus, a cluster (1640 mm ) in the bilateral cingulate gyrus and extending to its anterior part, and, finally, a cluster (1376 mm ) in the right middle frontal gyrus. \n\nRegarding the Western group of studies ( ,  ), the ALE algorithm converged in a first cluster (4358 mm ) in the right cerebral hemisphere, including the striatum, the claustrum, and the right insula and extending to a small part of the right inferior frontal gyrus, followed by an almost symmetric cluster (2152 mm ) in the left hemisphere, including the insula and claustrum. The third cluster (2120 mm ) was located in the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, whereas the fourth cluster (1768 mm ) was centered in the medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA). Finally, we observed a last cluster (1496 mm ) in the left pre-central gyrus. \n\nAs expected, the conjunction analysis between the Western and Eastern groups revealed almost all the above-listed areas ( ,  ). \n\nThe contrast analysis ( ,  ) between Western and Eastern groups of studies showed, in the former, one cluster (1152 mm ) centered in the left pre-central gyrus, followed by a cluster (624 mm ) located in the right middle frontal gyrus, with one cluster (352 mm ) included in the right insula. Finally, we observed one last cluster (256 mm ) in the right superior frontal gyrus. \n\nThe opposite contrast (Eastern versus Western) showed a first cluster (632 mm ) in the right middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus and the pre-central gyrus, followed by a cluster (312 mm ) in the right inferior frontal gyrus and a cluster (296 mm ) in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Finally, we observed one last cluster (280 mm ) in the striatum. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to explore how belonging to either Western or Eastern cultures may result in the distinct functional recruitment of brain areas involved in cognitive control. To accomplish this, we gathered data from studies investigating cognitive control in Western and Eastern population samples, utilizing fMRI to measure performance in the Stop Signal Task (SST) and Go\/Nogo tasks. \n\nOur meta-analyses revealed that most of the clusters identified via ALE in both Western and Eastern culture groups were located in the same brain regions. This was evident not only in the separate analyses of each group of studies, but also in the conjunction analysis, which allowed us to identify common areas of activation across both populations. The regions observed in the present meta-analysis align with those identified in previous meta-analyses of fMRI studies on the Go\u2013Nogo and SST tasks [ , , ]. Specifically, the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), right prefrontal cortices (r-IFG, r-MFG, r-SFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, claustrum, and thalamus were consistently observed across these studies. \n\nNotably, upon conducting a contrast analysis on the two groups of studies (Eastern vs. Western culture countries), we observed differences between the underlying networks revealed by the ALE. A discernible pattern of significant clusters was distributed over the right prefrontal cortex. In particular, the contrast between Eastern and Western study groups revealed activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, while the opposite contrast (Western vs. Eastern study groups) showed distinct clusters in the right middle and superior frontal gyri. These results indicate pronounced recruitment of the middle and superior regions of the right prefrontal cortex in the Western group, whereas the lower regions (i.e., inferior prefrontal cortex) are more prominently activated in the Eastern group. This finding is particularly noteworthy as the prefrontal cortex is widely recognized as a region responsible for the inhibitory control of cognitive processes [ , , , ], and there appears to be a dissociation between the right inferior frontal gyrus and the middle\/superior frontal gyri depending on the inhibitory phase. To be more precise, the right inferior frontal gyrus (r-IFG) plays a significant role in the attentional aspects of cognitive control and is involved in all stages of inhibition. However, its primary function, according to recent studies, lies in the proactive phase of inhibition [ , , ]. That is, a top-down form of inhibitory control that governs the processes preceding event occurrence, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of motor responses [ , ]. In contrast, the right superior and middle frontal gyri (r-S\/MFG) are pivotal brain regions for reactive inhibition, which is a bottom-up form of inhibitory control. Reactive inhibition is believed to act as a \u201ccut-trigger,\u201d halting an already initiated motor response [ , , , ]. \n\nThe results herein highlight the greater propensity of Eastern populations to activate brain regions that mediate proactive inhibitory control, while those from Western cultures may rely more on reactive inhibitory brain regions to achieve accurate inhibition during cognitive control tasks. This is an intriguing result as it may suggest that proactive inhibition, as reflected in brain activations, may play a crucial role in fostering the collective and interdependent behavior that is commonly observed in people of Eastern cultures. On the other hand, reactive inhibition, as a cognitive control mechanism, may be predominant in achieving efficient cognitive control for cultures that prioritize individualism and independence, which are commonly observed in Western cultures [ , , , , ]. \n\nHowever, from an alternative perspective, we can speculate that the difference in prioritizing reactive control might arise from the Western inclination for swift action, influenced by their fast-paced lifestyles, while the Eastern mindset might tend to favor contemplation and a more meditative approach to life. \n\nAnother difference observed in the contrast between the Eastern and Western groups of studies is the anterior cingulate cortex. This result corroborates our interpretation; in fact, the anterior cingulate cortex is not just a brain region responsible for detecting and resolving conflict [ , , ], but it is also at the basis of the proactive mechanism, as recently pointed out in different studies [ , ]. Indeed, being able to better manage and resolve conflicts is undoubtedly a necessary skill for adapting to more collective cultures such as those in the Eastern countries. Hence, it is not surprising that this brain region has been consistently identified as neuro-anatomically and functionally [ ] different in individuals from Eastern cultures when compared to their Western counterparts. \n\nFinally, we observed greater activation of the striatum in the group of Eastern culture countries and higher activation of the left precentral cortex in the group of Western culture countries. The former finding aligns with the possibility that individuals from Eastern cultures may possess stronger inhibitory control, although this assertion lacks conclusive evidence. Conversely, the latter finding suggests that individuals from Western cultures may exhibit a more impulsive response during the Go\u2013Nogo and SST tasks. Indeed, Gavazzi et al. [ ] reported a positive correlation between impulsivity during the proactive phase of a Go\u2013Nogo task and increased BOLD signals in the left precentral gyrus. This is a result that is consistent with many studies reporting that the left hemisphere is crucial in the link between impulsivity and inhibitory control at the functional and morphometric neuroimaging levels [ ]. Additionally, there is evidence showing that the left hemisphere may be dominant, or is at least involved, in some aspects of inhibitory control [ , ]. Despite the existence of several pieces of evidence linking inhibition and impulsivity, an ongoing debate remains regarding the possibility [ ] that impulsivity may not be directly related to inhibitory control. Therefore, future studies are needed to assess our interpretation of the precentral gyrus. \n\nTaking into account the examination of these findings in the broader ongoing discussion about the complex interplay between culture and the brain, and their reciprocal influence [ ], it is plausible to speculate that environmental factors significantly contribute to the impact of culture on inhibitory neuroprocesses. Notably, the cultural differentiation of the brain appears to be influenced more by the cultural aspects of the environment in which individuals reside, rather than solely by their race or original culture [ ]. However, it is important to note that the involvement of genetic or gene\u2013environment effects cannot be completely discounted. In fact, genetic expression appears to be implicated in cultural aspects, such as the acquisition of cultural norms [ ]. \n\nOverall, the present findings suggest differential activation of the inhibitory network in Eastern-collectivist and Western-individualist cultures. Our meta-analysis corroborates the findings of the few studies conducted to compare inhibitory processes using a cross-cultural design [ , , ]. Namely, differential activations of brain regions embedded in the inhibitory network (i.e., the dACC in relation to prediction error [ ] and the IFG [ , ]) have been reported. Therefore, previous neuroimaging data may support our hypothesis of higher engagement of the proactivity-related brain regions [ ] during inhibitory tasks in collectivist cultures compared to individualist cultures. Interestingly, Telzer et al. [ ] found a greater decline in inhibitory behavioral performance over time in Western participants than in Eastern participants, an effect paralleled by increasing activation of the IFG among the collectivist group, while this neural activation stayed low in the individualist group. Most evidence of cultural differentiation in inhibitory behavioral performance comes from childhood studies, with children from collectivist cultures outperforming those from individualist ones in inhibition efficiency [ , , , , , , ]. Regarding adults, if neural results always point out a cultural differentiation, this is not always the case for behavioral data. Namely, enhanced inhibitory performance for collectivism vs. individualism have been found in some studies [ , ], but not in others [ , , ]. Different task designs or group compositions might represent confounding variables to be taken into careful consideration while interpreting contrasting evidence from these behavioral findings. A dissociation between neuroimaging and behavioral data does not come as a surprise, as behavioral measures, especially when embedded in neuroimaging designs, might lack sensibility. In fact, cultural differentiation in neurocognitive functions might occur even in the absence of purely behavioral evidence thanks to the extra fine-grained level of analysis [ , , ]. \n\nSome limitations should be acknowledged. First, to reach adequate statistical power, we were forced to use broad inclusion criteria for studies examining subjects from Western and Eastern culture countries. In addition, our current methodology did not enable us to eliminate certain potential confounding variables that require further examination in future studies. Specifically, two key factors that necessitate exploration in subsequent research are the lack of measures allowing for the exploration of brain\u2013behavior relationships, and the requirement for a quantitative assessment of the cultural aspects pertaining to the participants included in the studies. Additionally, due to missing data, we were unable to retrieve education information from all of the studies. Finally, it is important to recognize that our meta-analysis did not reveal some commonly observed subcortical brain areas, such as the subthalamic nucleus [ , ]. This limitation has been commonly observed in fMRI studies, as demonstrated by Isherwood et al. [ ]. \n\nFuture studies should aim to utilize larger and more diverse samples, control for more confounding variables, and incorporate culturally sensitive experimental designs to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these cultural differences in inhibitory control and the impact of cultural context on the development and manifestation of these processes. Moreover, understanding how these cultural differences in inhibitory control influence behavior and cognition can have practical implications, such as in educational and clinical settings. For instance, in the case of clinical settings, this knowledge may help to develop customized interventions that align with the cultural context of patients, thereby increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes, enhancing therapeutic alliances, and improving treatment adherence [ , ]. Furthermore, it can aid in identifying at-risk individuals and implementing early interventions to prevent mental health problems. \n\nBy better understanding the neural mechanisms associated with cultural differences, we can gain insights into how culture influences cognition and behavior, and ultimately develop more effective interventions to address cultural disparities in health and well-being. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10295933,"text_md5":"cf35a10a1b157d520758ce207f290a13","field_positions":{"authors":[0,165],"journal":[166,175],"publication_year":[177,181],"title":[192,256],"keywords":[270,388],"abstract":[401,1838],"body":[1847,25674]},"batch":2,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci13060907","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10295933","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10295933"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10295933\">10295933<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10295933  Cultural Differences in Inhibitory Control: An ALE Meta-Analysis"}

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature regarding neuroimaging of reading intervention, with a particular focus on reading difficulties (RD). To locate relevant studies, searches of peer-reviewed literature were conducted using electronic databases to search for studies from the imaging modalities of fMRI and MEG (including MSI) that explored reading intervention. Of the 96 identified studies, 22 met the inclusion criteria for descriptive analysis. A subset of these (8 fMRI experiments with post-intervention data) was subjected to activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis to investigate differences in functional activation following reading intervention. Findings from the literature review suggest differences in functional activation of numerous brain regions associated with reading intervention, including bilateral inferior frontal, superior temporal, middle temporal, middle frontal, superior frontal, and postcentral gyri, as well as bilateral occipital cortex, inferior parietal lobules, thalami, and insulae. Findings from the meta-analysis indicate change in functional activation following reading intervention in the left thalamus, right insula\/inferior frontal, left inferior frontal, right posterior cingulate, and left middle occipital gyri. Though these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies and the disparate methodologies used, this paper is an effort to synthesize across studies and to guide future exploration of neuroimaging and reading intervention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nYoung children who are at-risk for reading difficulties (RD) lag behind their peers in academic achievement and this achievement gap may grow over time  ,  , resulting in a lifelong condition that negatively impacts academic achievement, employment opportunities, and social interaction. Consequently, remediating reading difficulties is a paramount goal of education, requiring research that disentangles the causes and symptoms of reading difficulties and develops effective treatment. RD can involve difficulties with reading at the word level or language processing level. While some children have specific comprehension difficulties, children with word level difficulties (decoding and\/or word recognition) may have comprehension difficulties as well. In the general population, estimates of reading difficulty in children at the word level (dyslexia) range from 6 to 17%   and these children typically have a phonological processing deficit (e.g.,  ). Children with word-level difficulties tend to be identified during the early elementary years  ,  , though some do not experience difficulties until late elementary or middle school years  \u2013 . \n\n### Behavioral Responsiveness to Intervention \n  \nBehavioral interventions have been found effective in remediating reading difficulties in some, but not all, individuals with RD  ,  \u2013 . Interventions that are effective for most children involve explicit instruction and address the reading components of phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension  \u2013 . Determining which children will and will not readily respond to intervention could inform resource allocation such that children who are not likely to respond well could receive more intensive or individually targeted instruction sooner. A review by Al Otaiba and Fuchs   determined that the majority of children who exhibit low responsiveness to intervention have a phonological awareness deficit, and other deficiencies may include problems with phonological retrieval or encoding, verbal ability, behavior, and developmental delays. These findings are supported by meta-analyses showing that individual responsiveness to intervention can be influenced by rapid automatic naming (RAN) skills, problem behaviors, phonological awareness, alphabetic principle, memory, and IQ  , and that pre-intervention differences in real word identification, word attack, and reading comprehension are predictive of gains following intervention  . These studies establish the behavioral characteristics of deficient responsiveness quite well, but perhaps these are overt symptoms of an underlying deficit. Biological factors (genes and the brain) influence cognitive factors which in turn influence behavior, all three of which are impacted by an individual's environment  . Understanding the behavioral profile of differential intervention response is necessary and useful, but to further characterize RD and potential underlying causes, the neurobiology of reading, RD, and responsiveness to intervention should be explored. \n\n\n### Neurobiology of RD and Learning \n  \nThough extensive literature has characterized the behavioral aspects associated with RD, the underlying cognitive causes of RD are not fully elucidated and are currently under investigation. RD in the general population appears to be part of a normally distributed continuum of reading ability  ,  . Growing evidence indicates that the behavioral symptoms of RD are associated with anomalous underlying neurobiology which may be distributed along a continuum as well or perhaps diverges from that of typical readers in different ways according to the type of reading deficit as some structural evidence suggests  . This underlying neurobiology is likely influenced by multiple factors\u2014genetics  , training\/instruction  ,  , nutrition  , epigenetics  ,   and possibly other factors  . The interplay of these factors creates variability in RD and adds complexity to diagnosis and treatment. Understanding the learning process at the neurobiological level and how this process may differ for individuals with RD may improve outcomes in the future for those with RD. \n\n#### Neuroplasticity \n  \nThe capacity to develop neural pathways and adapt to cognitive demands is the essence of neural plasticity. Changes in electrical impulses, chemical signaling, and histology underlie the behavioral aspects of \u201clearning.\u201d Describing the candidate mechanisms of neuroplasticity in detail is beyond the scope of this paper but to illustrate the complexity of processes involved in neuroplasticity we describe some of what is known and refer the reader to several excellent review papers. At the synaptic level, long-term potentiation (LTP) of the postsynaptic neuron in response to repeated presynaptic stimuli is widely believed to be a primary mechanism of long-term memory and learning  . LTP can lead to synaptic modifications that result in enhanced signal transmission  . Though short-term synaptic modification does not require protein synthesis, long-term synaptic changes seem to require protein synthesis and these long-term changes are considered to be the cellular correlates of learning and memory  . Beyond enhancement of synaptic connections through LTP, gray matter structural mechanisms of neuroplasticity include neurogenesis, axon sprouting, dendritic branching (and synaptogenesis), gliogenesis and glial modifications, and angiogenesis  . As numerous gene products are believed to be involved in learning and memory and protein synthesis appears to be required for long-term memory storage, regulation of gene expression is likely to be important in learning processes. Epigenetic mechanisms include histone modification   and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by microRNAs  . Clearly, learning and memory are complex events at the cellular and molecular levels. Yet, what does this mean for children with learning disabilities? Perhaps these processes differ for individuals with RD compared to typically achieving peers. An inefficiency in one mechanism of the intricate processes involved in storing and retrieving information could adversely affect learning. Such neurobiological differences could explain why some children absorb new knowledge effortlessly while others not only struggle to grasp new concepts, but may also have great difficulty in retaining and consolidating information. \n\nIf a characterizable neurobiological anomaly underlies poor response to instruction, identifying these individuals and developing an appropriate intervention could possibly compensate for the deficiency. To illustrate, a critical molecular process related to long-term memory is the effect that CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) has on genetic transcription. CREB is stimulus-inducible in neurons and involved in long-term memory by influencing protein synthesis  . In a mouse study, long term memory was adversely affected by CREB gene disruption, yet interestingly the learning deficit was overcome by increasing the time between the training events  . That is, modifying the behavioral training compensated for a molecular deficiency. Perhaps identifying underlying dysfunction in functional activity can lead to a specific intervention. A challenge lies in understanding these differences and addressing them perhaps in a very prescriptive manner. Whatever the deficiencies may be, characterizing those deficiencies through investigative techniques is a step in the process toward targeted remediation. \n\n\n#### Functional neuroimaging \n  \nNeuroimaging is a tool that can be used to explore brain activity and can make a valuable contribution to understanding neuroplasticity. Brain activity, as determined by imaging modalities such as fMRI and MEG, not only indirectly reflects the underlying tissue structure and physiology (as neurons must be present and functioning to exhibit activity), but also represents which areas of the brain are actively engaged when presented with stimuli of interest. Numerous studies have used imaging techniques to explore brain activity associated with specific cognitive tasks. A growing number of studies are exploring various aspects of reading to determine how the brain accomplishes the complex task of reading. Further investigations are concerned with how the brain differs in functional activity between skilled readers and readers who struggle. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging in typically achieving readers \n  \nStudies with unimpaired adult readers have revealed a left hemisphere reading network comprised of three areas: a ventral posterior region, a dorsal posterior region, and an anterior region  \u2013 . The posterior ventral region is located in an inferior occipito-temporal area. This area appears to be involved in visual processing and recognition of words  ,  \u2013  as even letters and pseudoletters elicit a response in this region  . The posterior dorsal region is comprised of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and angular gyrus (AG) and appears to be involved in phonological processing, transforming orthographic representations to phonological representations, and semantic processing  ,  ,  ,  . The anterior region is located in and around the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The IFG appears to be involved in phonological processing (e.g.,  ) and may be involved in articulatory recoding such that phonological input is converted to speech-gesture articulation output  ,   and semantic processing  . The studies establishing these regions have largely focused on single word reading. However, studies exploring reading comprehension have found left SMG and AG   and bilateral middle temporal gyri (MTG) and STG   to be activated by typical readers during comprehension tasks. While imaging studies of reading in children indicate a large amount of overlap with adults in activation, there are some differences. Some evidence indicates that over the course of development, activation in some more dispersed areas attenuates with age while increases with age are more focal, and these changes are largely independent of performance  ,  . For example, adults show less activation of left SMG and AG, areas involved in phonological processing  . This suggests that children are more actively engaged in using phonology to analyze words as they read, whereas adults have developed such automaticity in word reading that increased use of these phonological processing areas is no longer required. In contrast, adults showed increased activity in frontal and parietal regions thought to be involved in attention and top-down cognitive control  ,  . It is important to consider developmental changes in functional activity when reflecting on whether reading difficulties are more related to a delay in development or to dysfunctional reading networks that encourage development of compensatory mechanisms. Another recent finding in functional developmental changes is that sensitivity to visually presented words (i.e. activation response to detecting a word among progressively decreasing visual noise) increases over the school-age years in the L posterior occipito-temporal sulcus  . This may imply a more refined usage of an area used in visual word reading. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging of reading disabilities \n  \nOver the past two decades, numerous studies have reported differences in brain function during reading tasks for people with reading problems relative to controls with typical reading achievement and several narrative reviews have highlighted the commonalities among studies  ,  ,  \u2013 . The functional differences between RD and typical readers are generally characterized by reduced activity in L hemisphere regions for RD. Reviews of the literature have indicated that RD involves a dysfunction of the aforementioned three-region reading network: general underactivation of L temporo-parietal region (including STG) and ventral occipito-temporal (including lateral extrastriate, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyrus) and overactivation of the L IFG. This overactivation of the L IFG has been presumed to be due to compensatory articulatory effort and evidence that contradicts this portion of the accepted model has recently emerged  . Though less consistent than reduced left hemisphere activation, some studies have also reported increased right hemisphere activation that may signify compensatory activity for people with RD during reading tasks  ,  \u2013  and this compensatory activity may develop as early as second grade  . Adding further complexity, there is evidence that, at times, typical readers exhibit less brain activation in reading areas than do readers with RD. Rimrodt et al   found that adolescents with RD activated more than typical readers in the left middle and superior temporal gyri when reading incongruent sentences, perhaps suggesting more effortful processing of nonmeaningful sentences. Pugh et al   found through manipulating stimuli that for non-impaired adolescent readers, factors that make the word easier to process were associated with relatively reduced activation. However, for readers with RD facilitative factors were associated with increased activation in the same areas, \u201csuggesting that the LH reading circuitry in adolescent RD is poorly trained but not wholly disrupted\u201d  . Less activation may at times be reflective of knowledge consolidation. If cognitive processing is less effortful, then the resulting efficiency may mean less functional activity. Though evidence is limited, some studies have shown that typically achieving novice performers can exhibit increased activation, yet following training or practice, decreased activation is observed  ,  ,  . \n\nWhile the value of the narrative reviews cannot be discounted, meta-analysis provides a statistical approach to synthesizing across studies. In a meta-analysis of adults with reading disabilities compared to controls, reduced activation was reported for L hemisphere ventral occipitotemporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, STG, IFG, and thalamus  . Another recent meta-analysis, which included both children and adults with reading disabilities, identified underactivation in the L hemisphere inferior parietal, superior temporal, middle and inferior temporal, and fusiform regions and also reported underactivation in the L IFG that coincided with overactivation in the primary motor cortex and anterior insula  . In a meta-analysis that compared adults with RD and children with RD, showed similar results except that temporoparietal underactivation was seen only for adults with RD, not for children with RD  .These meta-analyses are consistent with the literature reviews in identifying a dysfunctionally underactivating left hemisphere network in RD. However, the meta-analyses indicate the presence of underactivation of the L IFG in RD rather than the overactivation assumed in the narrative reviews  . The meta-analysis would appear to constitute a consensus across studies, yet appropriate caution should be used when interpreting meta-analyses. Due to the necessary requirement of coordinates of activation to perform functional meta-analysis, not all relevant studies may be included in the analysis. Hence, both the meta-analytic approach and the narrative literature review provide insight into understanding differences between typical readers and those with RD. \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging of Reading Intervention Literature Review and Meta-Analysis \n  \nArising from the growing evidence of RD brain activity differences are questions surrounding how reading instruction can impact individuals with RD at the neurobiological level. In addition, questions arise regarding the relation of neurobiological differences and responsiveness to intervention. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the functional imaging literature associated with reading intervention. We sought studies that explored functional activity differences before, during, and after intervention including studies that examined responsiveness to intervention and associated functional imaging. We sought to include recent studies published since earlier summaries and reviews  \u2013 . In this paper we limit detailed examination to fMRI and MEG, including magnetic source imaging (MSI) which uses MEG in conjunction with MRI. However, it should be noted that in addition to fMRI and MEG, reading intervention has been explored with other methods and modalities. Structural imaging studies have included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  \u2013  and voxel based morphometry (VBM)  . Functional activity studies have used event related potential (ERP)  ,  , magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)  ,   and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment  ,  . \n\nIn an effort to quantify changes associated with treatment, we conducted ALE meta-analysis on a subset of experiments contained in the literature review. Meta-analyses have the potential to identify results that are consistent across studies in a more objective and quantitative manner than can descriptive reviews. The meta-analytic process may reveal commonalities across studies that did not command attention in the original studies because they seemed theoretically uninteresting  . Since its development  , ALE has become available as GingerALE on BrainMap.org   which has greatly facilitated the use of the meta-analytic approach for functional imaging experiments. Modifications have been made  \u2013  such that GingerALE version 2.1.1 supports random effects meta-analysis (rather than fixed effects). Also, values generated by ALE are weighted by sample size of each contributing study. According to the User Manual for GingerALE 2.1, the GingerALE process can be summarized in three steps  . First, an ALE value is computed for each voxel in the brain and the null distribution of each voxel's ALE statistic is determined. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) value is automatically included as it has been empirically determined  . Second, a false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm uses the   p   values from the previous calculation to compute the ALE map threshold. Third, a cluster analysis of the thresholded map is performed based on the selected minimum cluster size. Meta-analyses of neuroimaging of reading disabilities have been published in recent years  \u2013 . As ALE meta-analysis is necessarily restricted to including only experiments that provide coordinates in normalized space (Talairach or MNI), currently few studies are available for inclusion. This analysis explores these limited studies as a step toward synthesizing across studies in an objective and quantitative manner. \n\nThis paper is a review of the literature associated with neuroimaging of reading intervention in children and adults with RD. First, we review the literature regarding brain-based studies of reading intervention. This descriptive review examines studies conducting imaging before and\/or after intervention. Next, we present a coordinate-based ALE meta-analysis using a subset of the studies in the descriptive review. This subset consists of the fMRI studies that provided post-intervention scanning data in sufficient detail required for ALE meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Retrieval of Studies \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nTo obtain studies that examined brain activity associated with reading intervention, six inclusion criteria were stipulated. First, only peer-reviewed, primary research studies were included. Second, only studies with at least some participants designated as having reading difficulties, reading disabilities, dyslexia, or at-risk status for reading difficulties were included. For studies that used imaging to predict future reading scores, the designation of reading difficulties could be determined at posttest. Case studies were excluded. Third, the reading difficulty must have been idiopathic in nature and not the result of head trauma, stroke, or illness. Fourth, the studies were required to describe reading-related instruction that occurred during the experiment. Though the intended focus was upon intervention, studies in which participants received regular (business-as-usual) instruction rather than implementing an intervention were not excluded. Fifth, the studies were required to include neuroimaging in the modalities of either fMRI or MEG and the experimental design must associate the imaging with the reading instruction. Sixth, the functional imaging task must have been a reading task or a task of reading-related skill (e.g., letter sound matched to visual letter). \n\n\n#### Searches \n  \nTwo search strategies were employed to identify relevant studies and these searches were current as of January 2013. First, searches were conducted using two electronic databases,   PubMed   and   Web of Science.   The   Web of Science   search input was (TS\u200a=\u200a((reading disability OR dyslexia OR reading difficulty) AND (neuroimaging OR fMRI OR brain activation) AND (reading intervention OR reading instruction OR reading treatment))) AND Document Types\u200a=\u200a(Article). The   PubMed   search input was (((\u201creading\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201creading\u201d[All Fields]) AND disability[All Fields]) OR (\u201creading\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201creading\u201d[All Fields]) AND difficulty[All Fields]) OR (\u201cdyslexia\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cdyslexia\u201d[All Fields]) AND ((\u201cneuroimaging\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cneuroimaging\u201d[All Fields]) OR (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR (\u201cmagnetic\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cresonance\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201cimaging\u201d[All Fields]) OR \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201cfmri\u201d[All Fields]) OR ((\u201cbrain\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cbrain\u201d[All Fields]) AND activation[All Fields])) AND (((\u201creading\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201creading\u201d[All Fields]) AND (\u201cIntervention\u201d[Journal] OR \u201cInterv Sch Clin\u201d[Journal] OR \u201cintervention\u201d[All Fields])) OR ((\u201creading\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201creading\u201d[All Fields]) AND (\u201cteaching\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cteaching\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201cinstruction\u201d[All Fields]))). The   Web of Science   search yielded 75 articles. The   PubMed   search yielded 49 articles. The resulting 124 articles were examined and those that did not meet criteria were systematically eliminated ( )  . Next, using references from studies that met inclusion criteria, additional studies were considered. Additionally, Google Scholar searches were performed to locate papers that have cited some of the studies that met inclusion criteria. \n   Systematic review flow diagram.  \n(PRISMA template; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group, 2009). \n  \n\n\n### Data collection \n  \nData were gathered from articles, supplemental material, and from other works referenced in the paper as needed (e.g.,detailed descriptions of participants or interventions published separately from imaging analysis). Information describing participant groups, neuroimaging techniques, and whether or not the study only charted reading growth or implemented a reading intervention (in which case reading intervention approach was included) is presented in Results. Of the twenty-two studies included in the qualitative review, 21 included an intervention and 1 only charted reading growth (with no intentional intervention, but some participants received various interventions outside the study). Of the eight studies included in the ALE meta-analysis, all included an intervention. \n\n\n### ALE meta-analysis \n  \nfMRI studies that included either Talairach or MNI coordinates in their results were included in the meta-analysis. Data presented in MNI coordinates were converted to Talairach coordinates using Lancaster conversion provided on brainmap.org  ,  . Data presented in Talairach coordinates were included as presented in the original paper regardless of conversion method. Activation likelihood meta-analysis was conducted using GingerALE v.2.1.1  ,  ,  ,  . Only one experiment or contrast per study was included in the meta-analysis such that each participant group is not represented multiple times in analysis. When available, we selected experiments that contrasted activation increases for postscan over prescan in the RD group  ,  \u2013 . When RD Post > Pre contrasts were not available we used RD Followup > Pre  . When only postscan data were available, we used group contrasts RD > Control   and Responders > Nonreponders and Controls  . Eight experiments were included, with a total of 173 participants and 90 activation foci. Of the 90 foci, 1 fell outside the mask, 1.1% of the total. It is typical for a small percentage of foci to fall outside the mask  . A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and the recommended minimum cluster volume of 264 mm  (generated by GingerALE2.1.1) were used and images were viewed using Mango version 2.6  \n\nIt should be noted that we included foci of activation increases that the Eden et al   study stated fell short of their significance thresholds of   p  <0.001 and   k  >80. For the Richards et al study , we included only the orthographic experimental group as these are the coordinates that were reported and the group that showed significant change in associated with treatment. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe literature search resulted in 22 studies that met criteria for inclusion in the descriptive literature review ( ). The studies are presented in chronological order with their participant groups, interventions used, and intervention dosages in  . The imaging modalities, functional tasks, and imaging findings are listed in  . Descriptively synthesizing across studies, key findings by anatomical region are presented below. Following this qualitative synopsis, we summarize the findings of the ALE meta-analysis of the eight studies with post-intervention fMRI data. \n   Participant groups and interventions.         Imaging and Findings.        \n### Descriptive Findings \n  \nNumerous brain regions were found to be associated with reading intervention in these studies. These regions included not only frontal, temporo-parietal, and occipital cortex, but also sublobar and subcortical areas. Below we describe the findings involved in each region in depth. \n\n#### IFG \n  \nThe IFG was found to be associated with intervention across multiple studies. Following reading intervention, previously underactivating L IFG in RD more closely resembled controls  ,  ,   with one study showing underactivation of at-risk children shifting to overactivation following intervention  . Interestingly, Richards & Berninger   found that children with RD showed higher functional connectivity than controls for the L IFG as related to R and L supplemental motor areas and L precentral gyrus as well as R superior frontal gyrus. Following intervention, no difference was observed between children with RD and controls. An additional functional connectivity study   similarly found that L and R inferior frontal connectivity was the same following treatment for RD as compared to controls, but in somewhat of a contrast, found that nonresponders to intervention showed less functional connectivity than did responders. Hoeft et al   found that activity in the pars triangularis of the L IFG was positively correlated with reading gains, whereas L IFG\/Insula activity was negatively correlated. To summarize, it seems that L IFG involvement may be that of underactivation prior to intervention relative to controls, followed by normalization after treatment; however, there is not complete consensus among the studies in this review. \n\nThe right IFG is also prominent in findings related to intervention. Prior to treatment, at-risk children showed underactivation in R IFG  . Activation increases in R IFG were seen following intervention  ,  ,   and at follow-up   and considered to be normalized to the level of controls  . Prior to treatment, higher R IFG activity predicted higher reading gains for children with RD  . Following treatment, responders exhibited greater R IFG activation than did nonresponders and controls  . Nonresponders showed increased duration of activity in bilateral frontal areas  , and exhibited less functional connectivity between left and right inferior frontal regions than did responders and controls  . \n\n\n#### Additional frontal areas \n  \nWhile the IFG was the most consistently involved region in intervention, other frontal regions emerged in some studies with several studies presenting results in superior frontal (SFG) and middle frontal (MFG) gyri. Prior to intervention, children with RD showed underactivation in R SFG   and increases in activation were seen following treatment   and at follow-up  . Activity in the L SFG was positively correlated in predicting response to intervention  . At follow-up to intervention, children with RD showed increased activation in L SFG\/cingulate  . Prior to intervention, children with RD showed underactivation in L MFG   and L MFG activity contributed to whole-brain multivariate patterns that predicted responsiveness to intervention  . Pre-treatment activation levels in R MFG negatively correlated with posttest decoding scores  . Following intervention, children with RD exhibited increased levels of activation in R MFG  ,   whereas adults showed increased activation in R and L MFG  . More isolated frontal lobe findings include at-risk children underactivating in bilateral frontal orbital cortex at pre-treatment   and responders showing increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation . \n\n\n#### STG and MTG \n  \nSome consistencies emerged among studies in temporo-parietal areas, particularly in the STG and MTG. Before treatment, participants with RD showed underactivation relative to controls in posterior STG and temporo-parietal cortex that increased or normalized to the level of controls after intervention  ,  ,  ,  . Increased L STG activation was evident at follow-up as well  ,  . Responders to intervention showed greater activation than nonresponders in L STG prior to treatment  ,   and following treatment  . Also, responders to treatment showed increased duration of activity in posterior L STG and the L hemisphere sequence of activation changed for responders such that temporoparietal areas activated prior to frontal areas, such that after treatment responders much more closely resembled  . In young children considered at-risk for RD, underactivation was seen in the R posterior STG prior to treatment. In adults, increases in R posterior STG\/AG activation were seen following treatment  . While in one MEG study, responders exhibited bilateral temporal-parietal activation  , another study showed nonresponders having increased R temporo-parietal activation  . Because of the lesser spatial resolution of MEG, these areas are more general than in fMRI. \n\nThough the STG seemed to be the temporo-parietal region with the most consistent findings across studies, the MTG also emerged in findings from several studies. At pre-treatment, relative underactivation of the L MTG was seen, with activation increases observed following treatment  ,  ,  ,  . As for responsiveness, higher L MTG activity was predictive of better response to intervention  ,   and responders activated more than controls in L MTG\/AG following intervention  . In addition to the L MTG, increases in activation were also shown for RD in the R MTG following treatment  ,  . However, Shaywitz et al   found that R MTG activity was higher in RD at pre-treatment than at follow-up and Odegard et al   found that after treatment non-responders showed greater activation relative to controls and responders in R MTG. In addition, one study found that responders had increased activity at baseline in R mesial temporal cortex, an area not identified in other studies  . \n\n\n#### Other temporo-parietal areas \n  \nThough less consistent across studies than the STG and MTG findings, activity in other temporo-parietal areas, including inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), inferior parietal lobule, SMG, and AG, was associated with reading intervention in a few studies. In the ITG, children with RD underactivated in the L hemisphere relative to controls at baseline, a difference that was no longer present following treatment  , a finding in congruence with Gebauer, Fink, Kargl et al   that showed increased activation in L ITG for poor spellers\/readers at post-intervention. In adults, increases in activation were seen following treatment in R and L inferior parietal lobule and left intraparietal sulcus  . At pretreatment, at-risk children underactivated in bilateral SMG, and following treatment activated more than controls in R SMG  . Pre intervention L SMG and angular gyrus activity positively correlated with post-intervention fluency gains  . Following intervention, responders showed increased activation of L SMG   and activated more than controls in L MTG\/AG (BA 39). Adults showed increased activity following intervention in R STG\/AG (BA 22\/39)  . \n\n\n#### Occipital and fusiform \n  \nChildren with RD underactivated in the occipital\/fusiform region   and superior lateral occipital cortex   prior to intervention. Baseline activation in the R fusiform and R fusiform\/mid occipital gyri positively correlated with later decoding scores  . At baseline, children who were responders to intervention showed greater activation than non-responders in L ventral occipitotemporal region  . Post treatment L fusiform activation positively correlated with future gains in letter knowledge for young children  . Following intervention, increases in activation were seen in adults in the L fusiform gyrus   and in children in the L lingual gyrus  . Onset latency increased in R lateral occipitotemporal cortex  . Of interest, the only region in which children who were on track for typical reading achievement activated more than at-risk children who had received treatment was in the L superior lateral occipital cortex  . At a one-year follow-up, increased activation was seen in occipitotemporal regions for children with RD  . \n\n\n#### Pre\/postcentral \n  \nLimited evidence indicates possible differences in activity in precentral and postcentral gyri associated with intervention. Following treatment, children considered at-risk for RD showed increased activity relative to controls in L precentral gyrus  . Responders exhibited increased onset latency   of premotor cortex. Increases were seen in R inferior postcentral gyrus (BA 43) in adults following intervention   and in bilateral postcentral gyrus in children at follow-up  . \n\n\n#### Subcortical \n  \nPost-intervention increases in activation were found in adults with RD in the L hippocampal gyrus  . Increases in thalamus activity were observed in the left hemisphere following intervention for adults  , bilaterally for children following intervention  , and in L hemisphere for children at follow-up  . Following treatment, children with RD showed increased activation in L putamen relative to controls  . At follow-up in the same study increased activation was seen in L and R insula\/putamen. \n\n\n#### Insula \n  \nFollowing treatment, increased activation was seen in R insula\/IFG  ,   and at follow-up in bilateral insula\/putamen  . Prior to intervention, bilateral insular activity contributed to predicting response to intervention with a positive correlation for R insula and a negative correlation for L insula  . \n\n\n#### Additional sublobar\/medial areas \n  \nPrior to intervention, the R precuneus contributed to prediction of responsiveness  . At treatment follow-up, children with RD showed greater activation than controls in R precuneus  . Children with RD showed greater activation than controls in R anterior cingulate after treatment   and at follow-up  . Prior to treatment, L posterior cingulate activation was negatively correlated in whole-brain multivariate patterns predicting responsiveness to intervention  . At post-intervention, poor spellers\/readers showed increased activation in R posterior cingulate cortex when compared with a no-treatment group  . At treatment follow-up, children with RD showed greater activation than controls in R posterior cingulate  . \n\n\n\n### Results of ALE meta-analysis \n  \nOf the 22 studies in the qualitative literature review, eight provided sufficient information (i.e., coordinates for cluster maxima of activations at posttest when available or at follow-up when posttest was not available) to be included in ALE meta-analysis ( ). Results from the meta-analysis are presented in   and  . ALE revealed five clusters when using FDR of   q  \u200a=\u200a0.05 and a cluster threshold of 264 mm , the experimentally determined recommended threshold. These clusters were located in L thalamus, R Insula\/IFG, L IFG, R posterior cingulate, and L middle occipital gyrus. \n   ALE results.  \nClusters exceeding the recommended 264  threshold are L thalamus, R insula\/inferior frontal gyrus, L inferior frontal gyrus, R posterior cingulate, and L middle occipital gyrus (FDR,   q  <.05; Talairach,   z  \u200a=\u200a12). \n     Contrasts Used in fMRI Analyses of Studies Included in ALE.         Results of ALE meta-analysis of reading intervention.        \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Descriptive Review \n  \nThough relatively few studies have examined the neurobiology associated with reading intervention and differing methodologies have been employed, some commonalities among studies have emerged in this review. Our descriptive literature review revealed that across studies, reading intervention may be associated with differential activation in bilateral IFG, STG, MTG, MFG, and SFG, as well as bilateral occipital regions, postcentral gyri, inferior parietal lobule, and insulae, among others. In almost all of these regions, differences involve underactivation for RD prior to intervention with relative increase following intervention. These results seem to be consistent with literature that describes underactivation in these areas for RD relative to typical readers and points toward normalization through remediation. \n\nNot all of the patterns that emerged across these intervention studies were consistent with previous literature addressing imaging of RD. Several studies in this review indicated underactivation of L IFG prior to intervention for RD. Interestingly, while these findings are similar to that revealed in meta-analyses of RD   they are in contrast to the accepted model of L hemisphere dysfunction that includes L IFG overactivation in RD as a compensatory mechanism for underactivating temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal regions  ,   In the studies we reviewed, reading intervention was generally associated with increased L IFG activation to normalizing levels. However, as one study   showed overactivation in the L IFG (among other areas) in RD following intervention, there may be support for the conventional model of RD overactivating L IFG subsequent to intervention. One proposed hypothesis that would account for this pattern is that of an inverted U activation curve  . In this model, children with RD may have a different starting point on the curve when performing a reading task. They may start at (and remain longer) at the low point of activation. With intervention, they may exhibit increased activation in relevant areas. In contrast, unimpaired readers may start out with higher activation, but over repeated exposures or training will decrease in activation. While still speculative, the inverted U should be considered when conducting imaging studies with RD, even if the study is not directly concerned with intervention as perhaps undocumented or inadvertent treatment could be underlying increased activity. \n\n#### Responsiveness to intervention \n  \nIn addition to exploring the differences in activity associated with intervention, we were interested in finding predictors of intervention response and differences among responders and nonresponders. Individuals may vary in their neurobiological receptiveness to training or instruction. Exploring these differences may eventually facilitate the targeting of intervention to individual needs. A few studies have begun the investigation of neural predictors of reading improvement in children with RD. Pre-intervention fMRI activity in the R IFG   L MTG, L STG, L ventral occipitotemporal, and MEG activity in the R medial temporal cortex   predicts response to intervention. Hoeft et al   found that brain measures were more predictive of reading gains for adolescents with dyslexia than were behavioral measures, with greater activation in the R IFG during rhyme-judgment predicting greater reading improvement over the next 2 \u00bd years. Another study of adolescents who struggled with reading showed that brain activity prior to intervention was predictive of behavioral response to a year-long intervention that emphasized vocabulary, comprehension, word study, and fluency. Higher MEG activity in L middle, superior temporal, ventral occipitotemporal regions,and R medial temporal cortex predicted better response as demonstrated by word reading efficiency than was predicted by pre-intervention reading accuracy or fluency measures alone  . These areas overlap with the previously discussed posterior areas involved in reading. In general, this suggests that adolescents with neurobiological profiles more closely resembling typically achieving readers are more likely to respond well to intervention. \n\nThe studies which looked at differential responsiveness and post-intervention imaging indicated that children who demonstrate behavioral response as evidenced by standardized test scores, exhibited more activation in left middle temporal and posterior superior temporal areas  ,   and left inferior parietal region   following intervention as compared to children who did not respond to intervention. Nonresponders (a year after intervention) had increased right middle temporal lobe during a letter-sound task  . Functional connectivity data indicate that responders and non-impaired readers exhibit connectivity between inferior frontal regions that is absent in nonresponders  . Identifying these patterns of responders and nonresponders may provide insight into determining if these children are somehow at an optimal state to grow or unknowingly primed to respond to intervention, so that the lesser responders can be moved into that zone. \n\n\n#### Changes: Normalizing or compensatory \n  \nGiven that change in functional activity appears to be associated with reading intervention leads to consideration of what the quality or type of change is. That is, does reading intervention lead to readers with RD becoming more like typical readers or does intervention lead to compensatory changes that enhance reading ability? While the limited studies available may not present a definitive answer, they do provide some insight. Several of the studies reviewed provide evidence of normalizing changes  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , including normalized functional connectivity  . However, a few studies showed evidence of possible compensatory mechanisms  ,  ,  . Interestingly, one study presented evidence that responders to intervention exhibit normalization while nonresponders exhibit compensation  . Though the evidence is limited, this may be indicative of differing types or severities of RD (i.e., less severe RD responds better both behaviorally and neurologically to intervention). Alternatively, it is possible that the responders are typical readers who have not previously received adequate instruction and when provided with adequate instruction show the functional activation profile of typical readers. Another study   showed adults exhibiting both normalization and compensation, illustrating that not only can adults with RD be remediated but also that the capacity for both normalizing and compensating mechanisms remains intact into adulthood. \n\n\n\n### ALE of Post-Intervention fMRI \n  \nThe narrative review of studies provides valuable information. However, synthesizing across studies is challenging when so many brain regions are involved and results are descriptive rather than quantitative. Precision may be gained by using specified coordinates of cluster activation maxima in standardized space which can then be included in meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of eight studies experiments with post-intervention data given in specified maxima coordinates statistically overlapped with the findings summarized in the narrative review; however, some of the regions that appeared most prominent in the qualitative review were not the ones revealed in the ALE analysis. \n\nThe meta-analysis showed that following intervention, participants with RD exhibited increased activation in L thalamus, R insula\/IFG, L IFG, R posterior cingulate, and L middle occipital gyrus. These regions have been found to be active in processes that would presumably enhance reading ability. The L IFG likely serves multiple roles including phonologic processing and perhaps articulatory recoding  ,  ,  . The right IFG may play a role in attention and detection of important task related cues  . The finding of increased R insula activity may relate to increased coordinated relay of information and heightened detection of salient events  , useful processes in developing the skill of reading. The role of the L thalamus appears to be complex, but activity may be indicative of the role of the left thalamus in language and verbal memory  . While the posterior cingulate is believed to be involved in the default mode network, a role that does not particularly coalesce with these results, the posterior cingulate also appears to be involved in memory, language, and as a hub for information exchange  ,  . \n\nWhile all the regions of the ALE results could be contextualized within the qualitative review (i.e., they overlapped with those reported to show increased activation following intervention), the regions that were statistically significant by the ALE analyses did not include some of the primary ones that are generally discussed in the literature (e.g.,L MTG and L STG). There are two possible explanations for this. On the one hand, it may simply be a result of bias due to small sample size. The meta-analysis only examined functional differences following intervention and was limited to studies that reported coordinates of activation. Because this produced a restricted subset of the studies that were in the literature review, the resulting areas that emerged are unavoidably biased and differed somewhat from the regions that predominated in the descriptive review. Alternatively, these findings could reflect the salient features of growth; that is, while the other regions may also play a role, those found in the ALE results may be the most critical regions that distinguish growth. For example, the thalamic findings are especially intriguing given the thalamus' fundamental role across many types of cognitive processes. As such, it may be a strong predictor of those who are able to compensate through other mechanisms or pathways. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has its limitations. First among these is the limited number of studies that have explored neuroimaging and reading intervention. Even within these studies there are shared participants (i.e., appears to be identical groups or overlap among studies as noted in  ), such that this review is fairly limited in the number of unique participants. Also, due to the limited number of studies, we included studies that differed in several respects. For instance, we included one study that was performed with adult participants, though it has been established that adults and children differ in reading activation in both typical readers and those with RD  ,  ,  . In addition, we included studies that greatly differed in treatment type and treatment dosage. In a study with typical adults, Sandak, Mencl, Frost, Rueckl et al   showed that differences in treatment affect brain activation. Clearly, if differences in functional activity are related to treatment, type and dosage of treatment would be important factors. Additionally, though our focus was on RD, there is not a single definition for RD or being at-risk for RD and we found that the definition of RD varied by study. \n\nA further limitation of the study is that neither the narrative review nor the ALE meta-analysis considered the statistical thresholds for imaging analysis used by each experiment. Not all studies approach data analysis in the same way, which presents a concern when synthesizing across studies. An experiment with more liberal thresholds of significance or cluster size would have its coordinates entered into the ALE meta-analysis with equal weight to that of an experiment (of comparable size) that used more stringent thresholds. In some instances, journal articles do not provide all details of their methods and analysis. In more recent years, a call for more explicit description of experiment methodology and data analysis has occurred  . As the functional imaging field has grown and evolved, reporting of methods and results have generally improved with the understanding of what information is necessary to the reader. This is a natural progression for a field in its infancy, so it is with this perspective that we acknowledge that shortcomings in earlier works were likely due to limitations of the time. Nonetheless, it is important to state that at least one study appears to have used an uncorrected significance threshold and in several of the studies the reporting of methodology and statistical analysis is somewhat opaque. In one respect, our analyses are limited by the analyses performed in the original studies. In another respect, meta-analytic techniques are useful in identifying commonalities across studies and could add validity to studies that did not use stringent statistics if the results are consistent across studies. \n\nAnother limitation of this study is that we did not address task difficulty in our analyses. Task difficulty may have an effect on functional activity and this effect may differ depending on reading proficiency. As Pugh et al   showed, factors that make words easier to read (i.e., frequency, imageability, consistency) result in higher activation in reading related brain areas for RD while non-impaired readers exhibit, reduced activation. Interestingly, there is indication that even in a resting state condition, proficient readers show activation in reading networks  . This is an area of research that needs further exploration. \n\nAnother important consideration is we did not directly examine age-related differences. Gray matter development is not uniform. Rather, while areas involved in basic function such as motor and sensory areas mature early, areas involved in executive function, attention, and motor coordination mature later, with areas involving spatial orientation, speech and language development maturing in-between. As stated previously, functional changes occur over the course of development as well  . As such, when considering activity in a certain region of the brain, it is worthwhile to consider the typical course of functional activity in that region. \n\n\n### Conclusion and Future Directions \n  \nDespite the limited number of studies and the disparate methods of experiments included due to this low number, this analysis is a start at examining reading intervention and neuroimaging not only in a broad descriptive sense, but also in a quantitative manner. While acknowledging the limitations, the current results suggest that there are differences in brain activity associated with intervention. More studies using neuroimaging to explore reading intervention are needed to gain fuller understanding of functional activity and its relation to treatment. As reporting of functional data increasingly includes coordinates of cluster maxima, future meta-analyses will be able to incorporate more experiments. Also, we did not explore differences in type of intervention or dosages with regard to corresponding imaging data. Recently, an fMRI study of novel pseudoword learning indicated that the type of training used in new word learning may matter more to less skilled readers than to highly skilled readers  , so there is certainly a need to explore this in future analyses. As neuroimaging studies become more numerous and investigators become more adept at analyzing and reporting the data in sufficient detail, more targeted meta-analyses can be conducted. \n\nThis paper is an effort to review functional imaging findings that are associated with reading intervention. Using neuroimaging to explore intervention is not a new concept  , yet because these studies are complex, expensive, and time consuming, relatively few have been conducted. This is an early examination of an area of research that has substantial room to grow. Accordingly, caution should be used in interpreting results. Few conclusions can be drawn at this early stage, but this is an effort to guide future research and to underscore the need for larger scale studies. At this point, we are approaching this as a basic science question, seeking to better define one piece of a very complex puzzle. It is far too soon to suggest any practical implications, yet future studies may lead to practical applications that eventually impact treatment of RD. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3888398,"text_md5":"274810451226491d48f5fa68b6b283d5","field_positions":{"authors":[0,59],"journal":[60,68],"publication_year":[70,74],"title":[85,191],"keywords":[205,205],"abstract":[218,1846],"body":[1855,55154]},"batch":2,"pmid":24427278,"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0083668","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3888398","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3888398"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3888398\">3888398<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3888398  Neuroimaging of Reading Intervention: A Systematic Review and Activation Likelihood Estimate Meta-Analysis"}

It is most prevalent in elderly hospitalized patients and related to poor outcomes. Predisposing risk factors, such as older age, determine the baseline vulnerability for delirium, while precipitating factors, such as use of sedatives, trigger the syndrome. Risk factors are heterogeneous and the underlying biological mechanisms leading to vulnerability for delirium are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that delirium and its risk factors are associated with consistent brain network changes. We performed a systematic review and qualitative meta-analysis and included 126 brain network publications on delirium and its risk factors. Findings were evaluated after an assessment of methodological quality, providing N=99 studies of good or excellent quality on predisposing risk factors, N=10 on precipitation risk factors and N=7 on delirium. Delirium was consistently associated with functional network disruptions, including lower EEG connectivity strength and decreased fMRI network integration. Risk factors for delirium were associated with lower structural connectivity strength and less efficient structural network organization. Decreased connectivity strength and efficiency appear to characterize structural brain networks of patients at risk for delirium, possibly impairing the functional network, while functional network disintegration seems to be a final common pathway for the syndrome. \n   Highlights  \n  \nDelirium is consistently associated with functional network impairments. \n  \nRisk factors are associated with lower structural connectivity strength. \n  \nRisk factors are associated with a less efficient structural network organization. \n  \nStructural impairments make the functional network more vulnerable to deterioration. \n  \nFunctional network disintegration seems to be a final common pathway for delirium. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBrain network organization is fundamentally related to cognitive functioning ( ) and disturbed in various neurological and psychiatric disorders ( ). These impairments can even be a fingerprint of a specific disorder ( ) or a marker for vulnerability ( ;  ). Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by an altered level of attention and awareness with other cognitive deficits, due to another medical condition ( ). Delirium has several clinical manifestations: hypoactive, hyperactive and a mixed type. Hypoactive delirium is characterized by lethargy and reduced psychomotor activity and speech. Patients with the hyperactive subtype, however, demonstrate features of restlessness, hyper vigilance and agitation. In the mixed type, hypoactive episodes alternate with periods with hyperactivity ( ). Delirium is a common and serious clinical complication, affecting 10-50% of hospitalized elderly patients and related to poor outcomes, such as long-term cognitive impairment and death ( ). Delirium has been hypothesized to be a disconnection syndrome, caused by breakdown of brain networks ( ;  ;  ). \n\nSeveral risk factors for delirium have been recognized. However, known risk factors are heterogeneous and the underlying biological mechanisms leading to vulnerability for delirium are poorly understood. Risk factors for delirium can be distinguished into predisposing and precipitating factors ( ). Predisposing risk factors determine the baseline vulnerability for delirium, for example due to older age or cognitive impairment. Precipitating risk factors are acute changes that trigger the syndrome, for example sedation. Here, we evaluate if various predisposing risk factors induce similar brain network alterations, creating a more vulnerable (i.e. less connected and\/or less integrated) brain network. Network vulnerability may lower the threshold for a transition from a healthy state towards disturbed brain activity and connectivity. Precipitating factors may then cause an acute alteration in brain dynamics, that results in a global loss of functional brain interactions as a final common pathway to delirium. \n\nGraph theory provides tools to quantitatively analyze network organization from a whole brain perspective. A graph represents a network of nodes and connections between the nodes, i.e. the edges. On a macro level, structural brain networks can be reconstructed using anatomically defined regions as nodes and white matter tracts connecting these brain regions as edges. It is possible to map these brain networks with neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The communication between brain regions (i.e. statistical relations or synchronization between time series of neural activity, recorded from different brain areas) is regarded as functional connectivity, which can be used to reconstruct a functional network. These functional brain networks can be characterized with imaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), but also using neurophysiological measurements, such as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) ( ). In the latter case, nodes are the electrodes of the EEG recording, and synchronized activities between brain regions are considered as edges. The EEG signal consists of different oscillations, i.e. delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (>30Hz) band. All frequency bands show different functional network characteristics and can be analyzed separately. When the edges in a network are binary, i.e. a threshold is used to define if a connection is either present or absent, this is called an unweighted network ( ). A weighted network by contrast takes the connectivity strength or the weight of an edge into account ( ). Once a brain network is reconstructed, measures from graph theory can be used to further characterize network organization, which is illustrated in Fig. A.1. \n\nThe aim of this investigation was to compare graph theoretical studies on delirium and its risk factors to test the hypothesis that a disturbance in network organization is a final common pathway in the pathophysiology of delirium. The inclusion of risk factors was based on a recent landmark review on delirium ( ). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic review \n  \n#### Risk factors for delirium \n  \nIn this systematic review and qualitative meta-analysis, we based the inclusion of risk factors on a recent landmark review that described 29 recognized risk factors for delirium ( ). Dementia; cognitive impairment, i.e. cognitive problems without the clinical diagnosis of dementia; history of delirium; functional impairment; visual impairment; hearing impairment; comorbidity; severity of illness; depression; history of transient ischemic attack or stroke; alcohol misuse; and older age were considered as predisposing risk factors for delirium ( ). Polypharmacy; psychoactive drugs; use of sedatives or hypnotics; use of physical restraints; use of bladder catheter; acute kidney injury; decreased serum albumin; decreased sodium; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; metabolic acidosis; infection; iatrogenic disease; surgery; recent trauma; urgent admission; and previous coma were considered as precipitating risk factors for delirium ( ). \n\n\n#### Delirium \n  \nAs delirium is regarded as a manifestation of encephalopathy ( ;  ;  ), we included articles on either term, and grouped these into one category denoted as 'delirium'. \n\n\n#### Network outcomes \n  \nSince graph theory studies may include a variety of outcomes, we focused on the outcomes that are more commonly analyzed and have a straightforward interpretation, i.e. (connectivity) strength, global efficiency, local clustering and modularity (Fig. A.1). \n\n\n#### Search term and search strategy \n  \nReferences for the systematic review were identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from inception to September 2018, by use of relevant terms \u201cconnectivity\u201d, \u201cnetwork\u201d, \u201cgraph\u201d, \u201cdisconnection\u201d, \u201cdementia\u201d, \u201ccognitive impairment\u201d, \u201chistory of delirium\u201d, \u201cfunctional impairment\u201d, \u201cvisual impairment\u201d, \u201chearing impairment\u201d, \u201ccomorbidity or severity of illness\u201d, \u201cdepression\u201d, \u201c(history of) transient ischemic attack or stroke\u201d, \u201calcohol misuse\u201d, \u201caging\u201d, \u201cpolypharmacy\u201d, \u201cpsychoactive drugs\u201d, \u201csedatives or hypnotics\u201d, \u201cphysical restraints\u201d, \u201cbladder catheter\u201d, \u201cacute kidney injury\u201d, \u201caltered serum albumin level\u201d, \u201caltered sodium, glucose or potassium level\u201d, \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d, \u201cinfection\u201d, \u201ciatrogenic disease\u201d, \u201csurgery\u201d, \u201ctrauma admission\u201d, \u201curgent admission\u201d, \u201ccoma\u201d, \u201cdelirium\u201d, \u201cencephalopathy\u201d, \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d, \u201celectroencephalography\u201d, \u201celectrocorticography\u201d, \u201cdiffusion tensor imaging\u201d, \u201cresting state\u201d, \u201cmagnetoencephalography\u201d, \u201cbrain\u201d, \u201cneuroimaging\u201d, \u201cfunctional neuroimaging\u201d, \u201cpositron-emission tomography\u201d, \u201cstaining\u201d, \u201cneurophysiology\u201d, \u201cdiffusion tractography\u201d, \u201cdiffusion magnetic resonance imaging\u201d, and \u201cnear infrared spectroscopy\u201d (for the exact search term see Tables A.1 and A.2). Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those publications were reviewed on the relevance of the title and the abstract by two authors (SVM and AA). The full text of potentially relevant articles were evaluated by two authors (SVM and AA). \n\n\n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nWe included articles (a) published in English, (b) assessing whole brain graph analysis, (c) in humans (d) during delirium or during a state that is considered to be risk factor, (e) with use of a control group, (f) for functional imaging with measurements conducted during resting state without intervention, and (g) assessing one or more of the following outcomes: (normalized) connectivity strength of the global network, (normalized) global efficiency or (normalized) path length of the global network, (normalized) local clustering of the global network, and\/or (normalized) modularity of the global network (Fig. A.1). If eligibility for inclusion was uncertain, we discussed the article with a third author (EVD) and included the paper by consensus of all three authors. \n\n\n\n### Quality criteria \n  \nPrevious literature has indicated that network analyses may be subject to various methodological choices, for example the use of adequate connectivity measures ( ;  ;  ;  ) and the definition of nodes and edges ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These methodological choices can introduce bias and strongly influence the outcomes of graph analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, we developed a priori quality criteria based on state-of-the-art methodological studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Consensus papers from experts in the field of interest ( ;  ;  ) were used to assess the quality of the studies and quantify their impact ( , Appendix text Section A.1). Based on these, two authors (CK and LM) evaluated each study independently and categorized the quality as excellent, good or moderate. If the scores differed between authors, a third author (EVD or SVM) evaluated the study, and the quality score was determined after consensus of all three authors.   \nCriteria used in this qualitative meta-analysis to quantify the quality of the included studies. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Qualitative meta-analysis \n  \n#### Case-specific results \n  \nStructural and functional brain network studies were separately analyzed for the different risk factors. As different imaging modalities measure various aspects of the structural and functional networks which should be interpreted differently, studies were grouped according to the imaging modality, i.e. white matter networks based on DTI, grey matter networks based on T1 structural MRI, functional networks based on fMRI and functional networks based on EEG or MEG. fMRI and EEG or MEG can be considered to give complementary information about functional interactions between brain areas, where the spatial resolution of fMRI provides more accurate anatomical information, whereas EEG and MEG provide a higher temporal resolution of functional connectivity. All good and excellent quality studies for each modality (DTI, MRI grey matter networks, fMRI\/PET, EEG\/MEG) were compared per risk factor and outcome measure (connectivity strength, global efficiency, local clustering and modularity). Results of the outcomes were selected from the articles by two authors (AA and SVM) independently and checked by two other authors independently (LM and CK). If comparison of the outcomes extracted by both authors produced contradictory results, the authors discussed this with a third author (EVD), and adapted the outcome after consensus of all three authors. If a publication explored more than one risk factor separately, we took the comparison of each risk factor as a separate result, referred to as case. \n\n\n#### Composite scores \n  \nAs methods used to perform graph analyses were not equal between the different included studies, a quantitative meta-analysis appeared not to be feasible. However, to study whether delirium and its risk factors are associated with consistent brain network changes we performed a qualitative meta-analysis, in which we summarized results of the different included studies in composite scores. A composite score for each modality (DTI, MRI grey matter networks, fMRI\/PET, EEG\/MEG) and each outcome measure (connectivity strength, global efficiency, local clustering and modularity) was calculated. After exclusion of the moderate quality studies, all studies were given an equal weight in the composite score of the risk factor. The result of the composite score was one of the following: (a) \u201cno effect\u201d, i.e. outcome was assessed, but the majority of studies found no effect of the risk factor on this outcome, (b) \u201chigher\u201d outcome value, i.e. the majority of investigations found an increase of this outcome measure associated with the risk factor, (c) \u201clower\u201d outcome value, i.e. the majority of studies found a decrease of this outcome measure associated with the risk, (d) \u201cinconclusive\u201d outcome value, the more than 50% of the investigations reported contradictory results, (e) \u201cnot measured\u201d, i.e. no studies assessing this outcome were available for this risk factor. The composite score was accompanied with the percentage of studies representing the score (i.e. \u201cno effect\u201d, \u201chigher\u201d, \u201clower\u201d). For example, if 5 DTI studies on the risk factor aging assessed the outcome global efficiency, of which 4 studies found a decreased global efficiency in older subjects, the composite score was \u201clower: 4 out of 5\u201d. Outcomes of moderate studies were qualitatively described in the results section if no good or excellent quality studies were available. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur literature search resulted in 24442 hits of which 126 studies met our inclusion criteria (Fig. A.2). These 126 publications described in total 151 cases on different predisposing risk factors, precipitating risk factors or delirium (i.e. if a publication explored more than one risk factor separately, we took the comparison of each risk factor as a separate case) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For a detailed overview of included studies, investigated risk factors, measurement techniques, outcomes and quality scores see Table A.3. After scoring, 118 cases were graded as qualitatively \u2018good or excellent\u2019, of which 99 on predisposing risk factors, 11 on precipitation risk factors and 7 on delirium, and included in our risk factor composite scores.   show findings for each modality: structural networks based on MRI grey matter similarity, structural networks based on DTI, functional networks based on fMRI, and functional networks based on EEG. Below we describe findings on risk factors with at least 2 good or excellent quality studies, if not otherwise specified.   \nOverview of composite scores of graph studies on (I) predisposing risk factors for delirium, (II) precipitating risk factors for delirium and (III) delirium, grouped by modality. \n  Table 1     \n\n### Predisposing delirium risk factors and structural networks \n  \n#### White matter networks \n  \nDTI-based structural network studies generally showed an association of predisposing risk factors for delirium with lower connectivity strength and lower network efficiency ( , part 1A). Aging (2 out of 2 (2\/2) studies), cognitive impairment (2\/2 studies) and depression (2\/3 studies) were associated with lower connectivity strength ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Aging (2\/2 studies), cognitive impairment (5\/7 studies), dementia (3\/4 studies) and visual impairment (1 study) were all associated with lower network efficiency ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Depression (6\/7 studies) showed however no effect on efficiency and stroke (N=2) showed contradictory findings on efficiency ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The majority of risk factors showed no effect on local clustering ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Mixed results were found for different risk factors for modularity: while one study on aging showed no effect ( ), a study on dementia showed increased modularity ( ). \n\n\n#### Grey matter networks \n  \nEvidence for grey matter network alterations due to delirium predisposing risk factors was scarce ( , part 1B). The two studies on aging both showed an association between aging and loss of efficiency ( ;  ). However, no effect on grey matter network efficiency was found for cognitive impairment (N=5), dementia (N=6) and depression (N=6) in at least 50% of studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Inconsistent results were found for various delirium risk factors on strength, local clustering and modularity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Predisposing delirium risk factors and functional networks \n  \n#### fMRI and PET \n  \nfMRI-based functional network studies generally showed an association of predisposing risk factors for delirium and lower connectivity strength ( , part 1C). Aging (2\/3 studies) and dementia (2\/3 studies) were associated with lower fMRI connectivity strength ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The same effect was found for cognitive impairment (2\/2 studies) ( ;  ), but these studies were of moderate quality. Regarding efficiency, most of the risk factors reported conflicting results on fMRI and PET networks (cognitive impairment: N=10, dementia: N=11 and hearing loss: N=2) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Aging (3\/4 studies) and depression (4\/7 studies) were associated with no effect on efficiency in fMRI and PET studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). For local clustering, fMRI and PET studies on dementia (N=11) and hearing impairment (N=2) showed conflicting results as well ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), while most fMRI and PET studies on cognitive impairment (6\/9 studies) and depression (5\/6 studies) showed no effect ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Although all studies on aging (4\/4 studies) showed decreased modularity ( ;  ;  ;  ), studies on other risk factors showed inconclusive findings (cognitive impairment: N=6) or no effect on modularity (4\/5 studies) ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### EEG and MEG \n  \nEEG and MEG-based functional network studies showed mixed results with a tendency towards lower connectivity strength in the alpha band ( , part 1D). Specifically, aging (2\/2 studies) and cognitive impairment (2\/3 studies) were associated with a decreased EEG connectivity strength in the alpha band ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Studies on alpha band connectivity strength in dementia showed mixed results of decreased connectivity strength (1\/2 studies) and no effect (1\/2 studies). However, two moderate quality studies also showed decreased alpha band connectivity strength ( ;  ). No effects were found for other frequency bands. Mixed results for different risk factors were found on efficiency, local clustering and modularity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Precipitating delirium risk factors and functional networks \n  \n#### fMRI \n  \nEvidence for fMRI network alterations due to delirium-precipitating risk factors was scarce ( , part 2A). Sedation (2\/3 studies) and renal failure (N=1) were associated with decreased efficiency ( ;  ;  ), but coma (N=2) and neurotrauma (N=1) showed no effect on efficiency ( ;  ;  ). Mixed results for different risk factors were found for strength, local clustering and modularity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n#### EEG and MEG \n  \nEEG and MEG-based functional network studies generally showed an association of precipitating risk factors for delirium with lower efficiency and a higher local clustering in the alpha band ( , part 2B). Sedation (2\/3 studies) and neurotrauma (N=1 of moderate quality) were associated with a decreased efficiency in the alpha band ( ;  ;  ;  ). Sedation (2\/2 studies) and neurotrauma (N=1 of moderate quality) were further associated with increased local clustering in the alpha band ( ;  ;  ). No effect was found in these two risk factors on connectivity strength ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Delirium and functional networks \n  \n#### fMRI \n  \nEvidence for fMRI network alterations in delirium was scarce ( , part 3A). Only one fMRI study during delirium was detected, showing a loss in efficiency and local clustering ( ). Modularity was not assessed in this study. Three fMRI studies on hepatic encephalopathy ( ;  ;  ) (of which one of moderate quality ( )) did not show loss of efficiency, and reported decreased local clustering ( ;  ;  ). Two fMRI studies on hepatic encephalopathy (of which one of moderate quality ( ) showed decreased modularity ( ). \n\n\n#### EEG \n  \nEEG-based functional network studies showed an association of delirium with lower connectivity strength in the alpha band ( , part 3B). A decreased connectivity strength in the alpha band was reported in the available EEG publications (3\/3 studies) ( ;  ;  ), but two of these were based on the same dataset. No effect on local clustering ( ;  ) was found (2\/2 studies). An inconclusive effect on alpha band efficiency was found due to methodological differences between studies ( ;  ). Using the minimum spanning tree (MST) diameter, a less biased measure of efficiency than the path length of a weighted network ( ;  ), a decreased alpha band efficiency was observed. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe evaluated the evidence for alterations in the structural and functional brain network related to delirium and its risk factors ( ). On a structural level, predisposing risk factors were generally associated with lower connectivity strength and less efficient organization of white matter connections. On a functional level, a decrease of functional connectivity strength was found in most fMRI- and some EEG studies related to predisposing risk factors. The limited fMRI and EEG data available on precipitating factors generally indicated less efficiency of functional networks. During delirium, functional brain networks were characterized by decreased alpha band EEG connectivity and lower fMRI network integration. Taken together, we found evidence that a less connected and less integrated brain network is a common mechanism in the pathophysiology of delirium.   \nBrain network disintegration as a final common pathway for delirium. During the healthy state the structural white matter network and the functional network show an integrated and efficient organization. Predisposing risk factors were found to be associated with loss of connectivity strength and loss of efficiency of the white matter network and some evidence was found for a loss of connectivity strength in the functional network. Little evidence was available on precipitating risk factors, but sedation was associated with a loss of efficiency in the functional network. During delirium the functional network was found to be weakened and less integrated. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n### Effects of predisposing delirium risk factors on brain networks \n  \nAlthough all studied risk factors were generally associated with decreased strength and loss of efficiency, most conclusive evidence for brain network alterations was found for aging, dementia and cognitive impairment. However, depression showed an aberrant effect in global efficiency of structural networks. A possible explanation is that depression is a more heterogeneous disorder with a largely unknown biological substrate ( ), making it difficult to compare studies within this risk factor. The risk factor age showed a stronger risk factor-specific pattern compared to other risk factors. Investigations on aging showed decreased efficiency in grey matter MRI studies and loss of modularity in fMRI studies, while findings on other risk factors were inconclusive or absent. Aging is known as a key risk factor for delirium ( ;  ), which may be related to its extensive impact on brain network topology. \n\n\n### Effects of precipitating delirium risk factors on brain networks \n  \nThe small number of available studies on precipitating factors for delirium generally showed loss of efficiency of the functional network. Sedation and renal failure were associated with loss of efficiency, but coma and neurotrauma did not show this effect. A possible explanation is that sedation and renal failure are manifestations of acute brain changes, whereas coma and neurotrauma were studied in the subacute phase. Loss of network efficiency could initially have been present in the acute phase of coma or neurotrauma, but this may have normalized thereafter ( ). However, the evidence was limited, so more studies are needed to unravel the exact mechanism. \n\n\n### Effects of delirium on brain networks \n  \nDuring delirium, a variety of network changes have been observed, i.e. reduced connectivity strength, reduced global efficiency, reduced local clustering and reduced modularity, although the number of investigations was small. In general, the strongest evidence was found for a less connected and disintegrated network during the syndrome. Due to the limited number of studies, we are currently unable to distinguish specific network alterations to the different clinical subtypes of delirium. \n\n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nThe framework of graph theory provides new opportunities to study the development of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our rigorous systematic review and qualitative meta-analysis revealed new insights on the pathophysiology of delirium. The development and use of the quality criteria for network studies, largely based on recent consensus papers on methodological approaches, allowed us to assess the robustness of findings ( ;  ;  ;  ). These quality criteria can be used and adapted for future investigations on other topics. \n\nWe studied a variety of presumed delirium risk factors in relation to brain network alterations. As there is no general consensus which factors increase the risk of delirium, it could be argued that inclusion of some of these factors may have biased our analyses. In the absence of strong epidemiological evidence on the exact risk profile of delirium, we included delirium risk factors based on a recent landmark article published in a high-impact medical journal ( ). \n\nComparing brain network outcomes of different studies in a qualitative way may be unconventional. The outcomes of the studies were similar, but some studies differed in study design and exact calculations of the outcomes. Moreover, efficiency estimates may be biased by connection strength ( ;  ;  ), which may be relevant for our qualitative analysis. A qualitative assessment suggested that efficiency loss due to delirium risk factors may at least partially be explained by lower connectivity strength, but average connectivity was not reported as outcome measure in the majority of cases (results in Appendix text Section A.2). Future work, implementing recently introduced corrections for this possible confounder ( ;  ), is needed to show if efficiency loss is present independent of connectivity strength effects. Observations of decreased connectivity strength and loss of network efficiency have been associated to other disorders as well, and may therefore not be specific for the pathophysiology of delirium ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs positive and negative results are not equally reported in the literature ( ;  ), our review may have been influenced by publication bias. We have attempted to reduce this bias by defining the risk factors for delirium on a previously published landmark paper ( ), by using a predefined systematic search term and by conducting our search in two different libraries, i.e. PubMed and EMBASE. However, like in other systematic reviews and meta-analyses, unpublished negative studies could not be included. \n\nDelirious patients can be restless or agitated ( ), which may have influenced the quality of EEG and fMRI measurements ( ;  ). Although in EEG analyses artifact-free epochs were used and usage of fMRI motion correction was part of our quality criteria, the results shown in this study may still have been (partly) effected by motion. Future studies on delirium may benefit from strict motion correction. In addition, patients with delirium always suffer from an underlying physical condition and may use a variety of medication, which may have influenced the functional network status. However, the included studies on delirium all used a clinically matched control group to minimize medication (and other hospitalization) effects, and in some studies patients were even matched on (specific types of) medication use. Furthermore, antipsychotics such as haloperidol may not particularly influence measures of brain function( ). Likewise, delirious patients could suffer from brain damage, which might have led to differences in brain function ( ;  ). This may however not be the essential factor for network disruptions during delirium as studies that strictly corrected for brain lesions in their study sample report similar results as studies that did not ( ;  ). \n\nNeuropsychiatric disorders may be associated with alterations of hubs in the network ( ;  ). Hubs were not considered in the current study because of the lack of a formal definition of hubs, together with the small number of studies using hubs as a comparable outcome measure. Not all factors influencing vulnerability for delirium have been studied in relation to brain network alterations. Future work is needed to validate our hypothesis for other delirium risk factors and to integrate the framework of graph theory and brain networks with other biological processes underlying delirium. \n\n\n\n## A network model of delirium \n  \nOur findings suggest that delirium predisposition is associated with a less connected and less efficient structural network, and a less connected functional network. Structural and functional network organization are closely related ( ), and this relation may be of particular relevance for the pathophysiology of delirium. Computational studies have shown that reduced structural connectivity strength as characterized by reduced white matter volume, can cause decreased functional connectivity strength and efficiency ( ;  ). Moreover, weakening of structural network efficiency may decrease global spreading of information in the functional networks, disabling cooperative effects between network components ( ). Precipitating delirium risk factors may cause further loss of functional brain network efficiency towards a critical transition ( ;  ), consequently inducing an acute global loss of functional interactions and network integration, as seen in functional connectivity studies in delirium patients ( ;  ;  ). Accordingly, white matter network studies on delirious patients or patients at risk for delirium, specifically show disturbances in white matter network strength and efficiency ( ;  ), strengthening the evidence for our proposed network model of delirium. \n\nThe theory of alterations of brain networks does not have to replace other hypotheses on the pathophysiology of delirium. Important theories on the etiology of delirium include persistent neuroinflammation, an aberrant stress response and alterations of neurotransmission ( ). It remains to be studied to what extent these are associated with brain network alterations. A recent modeling study showed that EEG phenomena associated with delirium, including connectivity and network alterations, may be the result of imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activity, as well as increased fluctuations in subcortical information ( ). Particularly an altered balance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to network vulnerability ( ). Previous studies have shown GABAergic medication, including benzodiazepines, as precipitant of delirium ( ) and reduced network connectivity ( ). \n\nAt present, management of delirium consists of symptomatic treatment and treatment of underlying conditions, while there is no proven intervention that directly improves the underlying brain dysfunction. There is therefore a need for targeted interventions focused on the pathophysiology of the disorder. Non-invasive targeted brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), may normalize the functional brain network and can have beneficial therapeutic effects in several groups of (neuro)psychiatric patients ( ;  ). Based on the proposed model for delirium, we suggest that these network-based interventions, such as targeted brain stimulation, will be studied for delirium treatment. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDecreased connectivity strength and efficiency seem to characterize structural brain networks of patients at risk for delirium, while functional network disintegration appears to be the final common pathway for the syndrome. \n\n\n## Disclosures \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6461601,"text_md5":"26cf3d21d17f8210d15842334f49359b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,140],"journal":[141,156],"publication_year":[158,162],"title":[173,291],"keywords":[305,367],"abstract":[380,2366],"body":[2375,34643]},"batch":2,"pmid":30981940,"doi":"10.1016\/j.nicl.2019.101809","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6461601","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6461601"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6461601\">6461601<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6461601  Brain network disintegration as a final common pathway for delirium: a systematic review and qualitative meta-analysis"}
{"text":"Bedini, Marco and Olivetti, Emanuele and Avesani, Paolo and Baldauf, Daniel\nBrain Struct Funct, 2023\n\n# Title\n\nAccurate localization and coactivation profiles of the frontal eye field and inferior frontal junction: an ALE and MACM fMRI meta-analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nPrefrontal cortex\nSaccades\nWorking memory\nCognitive control\nActivation likelihood estimation\nMeta-analytic connectivity modeling\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThe frontal eye field (FEF) and the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) are prefrontal structures involved in mediating multiple aspects of goal-driven behavior. Despite being recognized as prominent nodes of the networks underlying spatial attention and oculomotor control, and working memory and cognitive control, respectively, the limited quantitative evidence on their precise localization has considerably impeded the detailed understanding of their structure and connectivity. In this study, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) fMRI meta-analysis by selecting studies that employed standard paradigms to accurately infer the localization of these regions in stereotaxic space. For the FEF, we found the highest spatial convergence of activations for prosaccade and antisaccade paradigms at the junction of the precentral sulcus and superior frontal sulcus. For the IFJ, we found consistent activations across oddball\/attention, working memory, task-switching and Stroop paradigms at the junction of the inferior precentral sulcus and inferior frontal sulcus. We related these clusters to previous meta-analyses, sulcal\/gyral neuroanatomy, and a comprehensive brain parcellation, highlighting important differences compared to their results and taxonomy. Finally, we leveraged the ALE peak coordinates as seeds to perform a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis, which revealed systematic coactivation patterns spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. We decoded the behavioral domains associated with these coactivations, suggesting that these may allow FEF and IFJ to support their specialized roles in flexible behavior. Our study provides the meta-analytic groundwork for investigating the relationship between functional specialization and connectivity of two crucial control structures of the prefrontal cortex. \n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007\/s00429-023-02641-y. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOwing to the capabilities that likely derive from the massive expansion in the cortical surface area\u00a0allowed by the folding patterns of the cortex (Van Essen  ; Zilles et al.  ), which particularly involved the prefrontal and association cortices (Donahue et al.  ; Toro et al.  ), humans possess one of the most complex behavioral repertoires in nature (Mesulam  ; Miller and Cohen  ). A fundamental aspect of functional specialization in the human brain is its relationship with cortical neuroanatomy (Van Essen  ). Microstructural features pertaining to cortical architecture (i.e., cyto- and myelo-architecture), such as cell types and layer organization, are a major determinant of the functional organization of the brain, and they provide important information about regional segregation (Amunts et al.  ). Over the past 30\u00a0years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; and in particular, fMRI) became the dominant technique for investigating this organization non-invasively and in vivo (Eickhoff et al.  ). Although regional delineations inferred based on architectonic criteria (e.g., cytoarchitecture) generally agree well with information gathered from MRI (Amunts and Zilles  ), such correspondences should be always interpreted with caution. These criteria may be weak predictors of functional organization in highly heterogeneous regions, for example when regions sit at the boundary of different Brodmann areas (BA; Amunts and Zilles  ; Brodmann  ). Moreover, this relationship may be affected by strong inter-individual differences, which were not taken into account in most of the previous invasive studies characterized by relatively small sample sizes (Amunts and Zilles  ). In addition to the previous prevalent invasive and lesion-based approaches, another way of conceptualizing functional organization and, more in general, the relationship between cognitive processes and their neural substrate, emerged from fMRI research with the functional localization approach (Kanwisher  ). Specialized processes are performed by brain regions that can be reliably identified across individuals with fMRI using standard tasks (hence referred to as functional localizers; Kanwisher  ; Rosenke et al.  ). In combination with the functional localization approach, research on structural MRI has shown that, despite the remarkable inter-individual variability in the organization of the gyri and sulci (Desikan et al.  ; Destrieux et al.  ; Ono et al.  ; Petrides  ), these functional modules can also be localized based on anatomical landmarks (Fischl et al.  ), which suggests a developmental link between the functional differentiation of brain regions and the mechanisms of cortical maturation (Zilles et al.  ). \n\nIn sum, in the human brain, functional specialization appears to be tightly linked and possibly follows from brain structure, although it remains to be established exactly to what degree this principle holds within specific systems. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), two lateral structures, the frontal eye field (FEF) and the inferior frontal junction (IFJ) have largely overlapping but complementary roles, being involved in several orchestrating functions such as attention, working memory, cognitive control, and other top-down processes (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini and Baldauf  ). In our previous review, we argued that despite these overlaps, it is their patterns of neural selectivity to spatial (FEF) vs non-spatial information (IFJ) that allow the dissociation of their role across these different functions (Bedini and Baldauf  ). This functional specialization may in turn provide an effective way to localize these regions with MRI. While the FEF has been studied extensively in humans and non-human primates, its precise localization and relationship to sulcal morphology in humans, and correspondence to the macaque FEF has proven to be difficult to establish (Amiez and Petrides  ; Petit and Pouget  ; Schall et al.  ; Tehovnik et al.  ; but see Koyama et al.  ). Neuroimaging evidence also suggests that FEF localization may be affected by substantial individual differences (Amiez et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Paus  ; see Bedini and Baldauf   for a discussion). The prevailing view is that the human FEF lies in the ventral bank of the superior precentral sulcus (sPCS), near its junction with the superior frontal sulcus (SFS; see Paus   and Vernet et al.  , for a meta-analysis and a review of FEF localization, respectively). However, some authors have argued that instead, a region localized ventrally in the dorsal branch of the inferior PCS (iPCS), termed the inferior FEF (iFEF, or sometimes the lateral FEF) may be the putative homolog of the macaque FEF (Kastner et al.  ; Schall et al.  ). Moreover, it has been raised the related question of whether the inferior FEF has been under-reported in the fMRI literature (Derrfuss et al.  ). In topographic mapping studies, peaks corresponding to the iFEF have been already reported (Kastner et al.  ; Mackey et al.  ) albeit they were not as consistent as FEF peaks in their presence across subjects and relative localization. Moreover, one study reported activations in the iFEF using a saccadic localizer task, which were clearly segregated from those elicited by a Stroop task (Derrfuss et al.  ). These analyses were performed in native space on an individual-subject basis, which is a very powerful approach that allows for carefully studying dissociations in adjacent neuroanatomical regions (Fedorenko  ). The IFJ, a region found ventrally and anteriorly relative to the iFEF, is typically localized near the junction of the iPCS with the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), sometimes encroaching into its caudal bank (Derrfuss et al.  ). The IFJ was only much more recently characterized as a separate brain region (based on structural; Amunts and Von Cramon  ; and functional criteria; Brass et al.  ) that performs\u00a0both\u00a0specialized (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini and Baldauf  ; De Vries et al.  ) and general domain processes (Assem et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ), in line with the multiple-demand hypothesis (Duncan  ). Currently, however, due to the interspersed and close arrangement of specialized and multiple-demand regions near the IFJ, common activation foci resulting from various cognitive processes have not been reported yet across experiments (see, however, Assem et al.  ). \n\nClearly, there is a need to better characterize the relationship between anatomy and functional specialization within the PFC. This is particularly critical, as the large inter-individual variability in the organization of the prefrontal areas and sulci (Germann et al.  ; Juch et al.  ) complicates the interpretation of the results of previous studies and may partly explain the discrepancies in the findings reported across research groups and methods. That such a link can in principle be successfully accomplished has been demonstrated in the visual system, where studies have shown that despite the inter-individual variability in the surface area of the early visual cortex (Benson et al.  ), specific anatomical landmarks (i.e., sulci) coincide very well with the borders of early visual areas as derived from various sources of data, including cytoarchitecture, retinotopic mapping, myelin content and resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (Abdollahi et al.  ; Fischl et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ; Sereno et al. 1995). Hinds et al. ( ) used surface-based registration methods (Fischl et al.  ) to identify V1 in new subjects from cortical folding information (i.e., the stria of Gennari) and showed that these methods outperformed volumetric methods in labeling this structure. Similarly, Benson et al. ( ) used folding information to predict visual responses within the striate cortex to a retinotopic mapping fMRI protocol. When moving up into the cortical visual hierarchy, however, the relationships between cortical folding and other neuroanatomical information become more difficult to establish and interpret (Coalson et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ). Wang et al. ( ) created a probabilistic atlas of 25 topographic visual areas and showed that anatomical variability (as measured by the variance in gyral-sulcal convexity across subjects) and the overlap of functional activations (measured as peak probability values) were negatively correlated, particularly in higher-order visual areas, suggesting that the former may play an important role in shaping their functional organization. In one of the most comprehensive efforts to parcel the cortical surface with high-resolution non-invasive methods, Glasser et al. ( ) found that the lateral PFC is one of the brain districts where the intrinsic neuroanatomical variability is higher than in the rest of the brain (see also Juch et al.  ), as measured by a decrease in the test\u2013retest reliability of their multimodal parcellation (MMP1). While the former limitations (i.e., the weaker association between cortical folding and function, and inter-individual variability, which particularly affects volumetric group-level analyses; Coalson et al.  ) have posed significant challenges to the interpretation of the relationship between cortical folding and functional specialization in higher-order visual regions, several studies have shown that adopting an individual-level approach in defining sulci may bear important implications for understanding cognitive function within the PFC (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Fedorenko  ; Miller et al.  ). For example, the study by Frost and Goebel ( ) showed that, by leveraging the former approach and improving the alignment in the cortical folding patterns using a technique termed curvature-driven cortex-based alignment, the overlap in FEF localization increased by 66.7% in the left hemisphere and 106.5% in the right hemisphere compared to volume-based registration in a sample of 10 subjects. These results suggest that the FEF is indeed strongly bound to a macro-anatomical location (Paus  ), and more generally the presence of a strong structure-to-function relationship in this region (see also Wang et al.  ). In the study by Derrfuss et al. ( ), which again was carried out using an individual-level approach, 13 out of 14 subjects showed activations localized between the caudal bank of the IFS and the iPCS that corresponded to the anatomical description of the IFJ in a task-switching paradigm. Taken together, these studies point to the need to better characterize the relationship between sulcal morphology and functional specialization within the PFC. This research line may in the future allow predicting functional activity from neuroanatomical information alone, thus accomplishing one of the fundamental goals of contemporary cognitive neuroscience in terms of inferring structure-to-function relationships (Amiez et al.  ; Osher et al.  ; Passingham et al.  ; Saygin et al.  ). In summary, the organization of the regions localized along the banks of the major sulci of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the SFS, the sPCS, the iPCS, and the IFS, has yet to be clarified spatially. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to accurately localize the FEF and IFJ based on standard fMRI localizer tasks. In particular, we wanted to reassess the precise localization of the FEF in standard space, and its relationship with the localization of the iFEF as inferred using saccadic functional localizers in the light of recent fMRI evidence (see Grosbras et al.  , Jamadar et al.  , and Paus  , for previous meta-analyses using fMRI and PET experiments). Further, we also wanted to re-examine the precise localization of the IFJ in standard space by inferring the convergence of activations across paradigms (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ). This information may provide important clues for better-interpreting activations in the posterior-lateral PFC based on combined structural and functional criteria. Coordinate-based meta-analyses offer a convenient way to summarize and model the uncertainty in the activations found across several PET\/fMRI experiments (Fox et al.  ) based on specific paradigms and contrasts of interest, overcoming inter-individual variability, and allow to establish adequately powered brain-behavior relationship. Here, we employed the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analytic technique to accurately infer the localization of the FEF and IFJ activation peaks in standard space By using the inferred ALE peak coordinates as seeds, we also performed a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) analysis (Langner and Camilleri  ) to investigate the coactivation profiles of FEF and IFJ in fMRI studies across paradigms in a data-driven fashion. Overall, the goal of our study\u00a0is to offer some consensus and anatomical priors to localize these regions with fMRI, and to guide future non-invasive brain stimulation studies. In addition, our study also aims to provide meta-analytic groundwork to investigate the relationship between the functional specialization and connectivity of the FEF and IFJ in large multimodal neuroimaging datasets (e.g., the Human Connectome Project; Van Essen et al.  ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Activation likelihood estimation fMRI meta-analysis method \n  \nThe ALE is a powerful meta-analytic technique that allows for assessing the spatial convergence of the activations reported in the neuroimaging literature (Eickhoff et al.  ). As a coordinate-based technique, ALE takes as input the activation peaks reported by several independent neuroimaging studies and tests their significance against a null distribution of the foci across the whole brain (Eickhoff et al.  ). This ALE feature is particularly useful given that in the neuroimaging literature results are usually reported and summarized as   x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates in standard space (Talairach or MNI), rather than as full activation maps accompanied by a statistical summary of the effect sizes, and even more rarely shared in that form (for important initiatives in neuroimaging data sharing see, however, NeuroVault:  , Gorgolewski et al.  , and OpenNeuro:  , Markiewicz et al.  , among other initiatives). This aspect becomes crucial in the case of brain regions that may be under-reported in the fMRI literature (such as the iFEF; Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ) or which only recently began to be included in the brain atlases taxonomy (such as the IFJ; Bedini and Baldauf  ; Sundermann and Pfleiderer  ). Here, we exploited this ALE feature by applying this technique to analyze two independent collections of fMRI studies performed over the last 30\u00a0years with the primary aim of accurately inferring FEF and IFJ localization in MNI152 space using the GingerALE software (v. 3.0.2;  ). In the ALE procedure, each set of foci reported in a study is modeled as a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered around the coordinates and whose width is determined based on the experiment sample size (Eickhoff et al.  ). Larger sample sizes result in tighter Gaussians, which reflects lower uncertainty about the \u2018true\u2019 location reported, whereas lower samples lead to larger Gaussians that are more spread around the respective peak coordinates, thus conveniently reflecting lower confidence about their corresponding locations. These activations are then combined into a modeled activation map for each experiment of a study. Importantly, in the revised ALE algorithm, within-study effects that could result from the summation of adjacent foci are minimized, so that studies that reported activation in a higher number or more densely organized foci would not drive the ALE results disproportionately (Turkeltaub et al.  ). By computing the union of all these modeled activation maps, an ALE score for each voxel in the brain is obtained (Eickhoff et al.  ). The significance of these scores is then assessed by comparing them with the null distribution obtained by randomly reassigning the modeled activations across the whole brain with a permutation approach. Finally, the thresholded p-values are usually corrected for multiple comparisons using either voxel-level or cluster-level family-wise error (FWE). The use of uncorrected p-values and false discovery rate is instead generally not advised since it can lead to spurious findings (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\nThe present meta-analysis focused on specific cognitive functions (described more in detail in the ' ') in which the FEF and IFJ and the associated brain networks are relatively well-known to be involved. More specifically, in what we will refer to in the following as the \u2018FEF sample\u2019, we applied the ALE technique to several independent fMRI studies requiring the planning and execution of visually guided and voluntary eye movements, as a considerable number of previous studies clearly showed that these types of tasks elicit activation in the FEF, and other eye fields (for previous meta-analyses see Cieslik et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ; Paus  ). In particular, tasks requiring the execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted against a fixation baseline are the most prevalent and consensually established FEF functional localizer in the human fMRI literature (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Kastner et al.  ). In the case of the \u2018IFJ sample\u2019, it is arguably more difficult to pinpoint a widely employed functional localizer for this region, We, therefore, anticipate that in this sample we analyzed data from a more heterogeneous collection of fMRI studies investigating covert attention, working memory, and cognitive control across a wider range of paradigms. \n\n\n### Study selection criteria \n  \nThe selection criteria of the sample of studies for the present meta-analysis followed the best-practice recommendations and guidelines by M\u00fcller et al. ( ). Multiple bibliographic searches were performed between May 2019 and January 2021 (cutoff date). A final search was conducted with the same criteria and cutoff dates (i.e., January 1, 1990\u2013January 1, 2021) by the first author MB to comply with the updated PRISMA guidelines (Page et al.  ) and as a sanity check. The selection procedure is reported in Figures S1 and S2 (created based on the PRISMA flow diagram; Page et al.  ), which refer to the \u2018FEF sample\u2019 and the \u2018IFJ sample\u2019, respectively. All the bibliographical searches were carried out using the Web of Science ( ). We searched records in the Web of Science Core Collection using the keywords \u2018fMRI\u2019 AND \u2018frontal eye field\u2019 (all fields) in the first instance, and \u2018fMRI\u2019 AND \u2018inferior frontal junction\u2019 (all fields) in the second. We complemented these results with other sources (Google Scholar, personal collection of articles and references cited by the studies retrieved) by one of the authors (MB). In the FEF sample, our search identified a total of 711 records, from which we removed all the review papers. 665 records were further screened, and 470 of these were sought for retrieval to assess their adequacy with respect to the inclusion criteria (described below). In the IFJ sample, 375 results were identified, from which, after removing the\u00a0review papers, 356 records were further screened, and 142 of these were sought for retrieval to assess their adequacy with respect to our inclusion criteria. The general inclusion criteria consisted of the following. Each study selected: 1. Reported coordinates in standard space (either MNI or Talairach); 2. Was an fMRI study (we decided to not include PET studies as our goal was to keep our samples as homogeneous as possible in terms of the signal measured, the spatial resolution and analysis pipelines (Botvinik-Nezer et al.  ) to make our results specific to the fMRI field); 3. Performed on a scanner of 3\u00a0T or higher field; 4. Tested and reported results from healthy adults (18\u201360\u00a0years old; or an appropriate control group in the case of clinical studies); 5. The study acquired whole-brain fMRI data or with a FOV that was sufficiently large to cover the posterior frontal lobe (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for the FOV of each study). The last group of inclusion criteria is specific to each sample (the FEF or the IFJ) and is primarily related to the type of experimental paradigm utilized in the fMRI study and the specific contrasts analyzed. Here, we strived to find a balance that would adequately represent the various localization methods that have been pursued in the fMRI literature, while also assigning a higher weight in the sample to the more standardized and replicated localization approaches. \n\n\n### FEF sample inclusion criteria \n  \nThe human FEF is a well-characterized region in the fMRI literature (Bedini and Baldauf  ), although some uncertainties persist regarding the correspondence of its localization obtained from fMRI compared with other methods (i.e., brain stimulation; Vernet et al.  ) and with the macaque FEF (Koyama et al.  ; Petit and Pouget  ). The region is crucially involved in the top-down control of eye movements and spatial attention (Astafiev et al.  ; Beauchamp et al.  ; Corbetta et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ), and it is considered a prominent node of the dorsal attention network (Corbetta and Shulman  ; Fox et al.  ; Yeo et al.  ). A very simple and time-efficient yet effective way to localize the FEF with\u00a0fMRI is to have participants perform an experimental block of visually guided saccades toward an unpredictable peripheral target and contrast this activation with a fixation block (Amiez et al.  ). The resulting activations\u2014usually found near the junction of the SFS and the sPCS\u2014are then assumed to correspond to the FEF (Paus  ). However, depending on the statistical thresholds and analytical approach adopted, in addition to this superior cluster, often this type of contrast reveals a more widespread pattern of activity along the banks of the iPCS (Beauchamp et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Luna et al.  ). Therefore, this localization method does not seem to have adequate functional specificity if not combined with the additional anatomical criteria mentioned above. Building on this approach, the antisaccade task and its neural mechanisms have been extensively studied in the non-human primate neurophysiology literature (Munoz and Everling  ), and this task has been employed as a measure of inhibitory control in healthy and clinical populations in humans (Hutton and Ettinger  ). Briefly, in the antisaccade task, the subject is required to keep fixation until a visual target appears and to look at its mirror location. Computationally, this requires at least two mechanisms: the first one inhibits a reflexive saccade towards the visual onset, and the second is responsible for executing a saccade towards the opposite location (the endpoint is in this case endogenously generated; Munoz and Everling  ). fMRI studies comparing the regions involved in prosaccades vs antisaccades have found overlapping activations in the FEF, although the antisaccade task recruits additional regions that seem to reflect the greater executive demands of this task (McDowell et al.  ). Within FEF, there is also increased activity in the antisaccade compared to the prosaccade task, which is particularly evident during the preparatory phase (Curtis and Connolly  ; DeSouza et al. 2003: Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2018; Jarvstad and Gilchrist 2019). Based on these results, it could be hypothesized that contrasting antisaccade vs and prosaccade trials may offer better specificity to localize clusters of activity within the FEF compared to the prosaccade vs fixation blocked design described earlier. Previous studies did not address this hypothesis directly, and it still needs to be tested in a within-subject design by examining the activation topographies at the individual subject level. Finally, in modified versions of the spatial cueing paradigm (e.g., Fan et al.  ), univariate analyses contrasting valid vs neutral\/invalid trials are often used to localize all the main regions belonging to the dorsal attention network, which are subsequently used as ROIs for functional and effective connectivity analyses (for examples see Vossel et al.  , and Wen et al.  ). It can be argued that, even though these adaptations are not generally employed as independent functional localizers for the FEF, they may be well adept at isolating this region under the assumption that covert and overt shifts of spatial attention have a shared and overlapping source in this region, which seems well supported by fMRI (Astafiev et al.  ; Beauchamp et al.  ; Corbetta et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ; Jerde et al.  ) and comparative evidence (Buschman and Miller  ; Moore and Fallah  ; reviewed in Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ). Indeed, the studies that directly investigated this question generally reported a strong degree of spatial overlap, although they also suggest that the signal measured in covert paradigms tends to be weaker than in overt tasks (Beauchamp et al.  ; de Haan et al.  ) and thus possibly less robust across fMRI data analysis pipelines (Botvinik-Nezer et al.  ). Thus, an open question is whether oculomotor and covert spatial attention tasks are equally efficient in localizing the FEF. \n\nIn summary, for the reasons introduced above, we included in the FEF sample all the studies that investigated the planning and execution of visually guided and voluntary eye movements (prosaccades and antisaccades) as well as covert spatial attention using both blocked and event-related designs (see Figure S1 for an overview of the selection procedure following the PRISMA2020 guidelines; Page et al.  ), analyzing mainly the following contrasts: 1. prosaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 2. antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 3. prosaccades & antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation; 4. antisaccades\u2009>\u2009prosaccades; 5. valid\u2009>\u2009neutral\/invalid trials. Combining these contrasts allowed us to carry out our main analysis complemented by three control analyses, respectively, designed to replicate a previous study (Cieslik et al.  ) and to investigate two additional research questions (see Supplementary Information p. 8). In our main localizer analysis, we pooled together all studies that reported at least a contrast related to the planning and execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted with a fixation baseline. \n\n\n### IFJ sample inclusion criteria \n  \nIn contrast to the FEF, the IFJ does not have a well-established homolog in the macaque (Bedini and Baldauf  ; see, however, Bichot et al.  ,  , and Neubert et al.  ) and its role started to be investigated only much more recently with fMRI (Brass et al.  ). Its functional profile remains to date not well understood and is characterized by a remarkable functional heterogeneity (Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Ngo et al.  ). Consistent with this idea, recent high-resolution fMRI studies showed that the IFJ (and in particular, the posterior IFJ as defined according to the MMP1 by Glasser et al.  ) belongs to the core multiple-demand system of the brain (Assem et al.  ), which identifies a set of regions that are engaged in multiple processes often across different cognitive domains (Duncan  ). This particular position in the cognitive processing architecture arguably poses a severe challenge in trying to define a gold standard for an fMRI localization method for this region, which would allow for effectively segregating it from adjacent coactive regions. Several promising approaches to localize the IFJ at the individual level have nevertheless previously been reported from different research groups ranging from attention and working memory to cognitive control paradigms (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ). The studies led by Brass, Derrfuss and colleagues were critical in establishing the IFJ as a region involved in task preparation and more generally in cognitive control (reviewed in Brass et al.  ). In more recent studies, these processes are reflected in the distinct components of executive functions, such as updating and shifting the task set, which consistently recruit this region (Nee et al.  ; Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.  ; Worringer et al.  ). \n\nBased on the evidence introduced above, in the IFJ sample, we decided to include attentional (i.e., rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) and endogenous cueing paradigms), working memory (primarily n-back paradigms; Rottschy et al.  ), and cognitive control paradigms (i.e., task-switching and Stroop tasks; Worringer et al.  ; see Figure S2 for an overview of the selection procedure following the PRISMA2020 guidelines; Page et al.  ). These inclusion criteria were based on Derrfuss et al. ( ), who investigated switching and Stroop paradigms, and we extended them to attentional and working memory paradigms that also tap cognitive control. The main contrasts analyzed were, therefore, quite heterogeneous, but can be broadly grouped into the following primary ones: 1. Oddball\u2009>\u2009Target trials in covert attention paradigms (e.g., RSVP paradigms); 2. Functional connectivity with a seed perceptual region (e.g., V4, V5, FFA) in the Attend\u2009>\u2009Ignore condition in n-back paradigms; 3. Switching\u2009>\u2009Repetition trials in task-switching paradigms; 4. Incongruent\u2009>\u2009Congruent trials in Stroop paradigms. We carried out exploratory ALE contrast analyses to examine potential spatial discrepancies between the IFJ peaks derived from splitting up the localizer sample according to the main cognitive function investigated (see Supplementary Information p. 9 and 20\u201322). \n\nIn conclusion, the final sample of the included papers for our ALE meta-analysis was   n  \u2009=\u200951 for the FEF, and   n  \u2009=\u200930 for the IFJ sample (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Information for a summary of the studies, respectively). The number of experiments was 35 for the FEF localizer sample, and 32 for the IFJ localizer sample. Both sample sizes were within the recommended range (i.e., a minimum of 20 experiments) to have adequate statistical power with ALE as derived from empirical simulations (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation procedure \n  \nAll the foci from the experiments included were mapped from Talairach to the MNI152 space using the function provided by GingerALE (v. 3.0.2; Eickhoff et al.  ; Lancaster et al.  ; see Supplementary Information p. 8 for details about this step). \n\nFor the main localizer analyses (FEF and IFJ localizer samples), the ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 was applied (Eickhoff et al.  ) with a minimum cluster size of 50\u00a0mm  (corresponding to 6 voxels). Compared to cluster-level FWE inference, which can only allow inferring that a given cluster is above a significance threshold as a whole, but critically, not that any putative region that is included in the cluster is individually significant on its own, voxel-level FWE allows to more readily interpret all the cluster extent as well as its peak location from the main localizer samples anatomically (Eickhoff et al.  ). Moreover, our sample sizes ensured that these clusters would not be driven by a contribution exceeding 50% of any individual study (Eickhoff et al.  ), therefore allowing us to interpret individual voxel ALE values as a proxy for the most active location across experiments. When retrieving the relevant foci, we first grouped the studies by a subject group rather than by experiment. This was done because grouping by subject group further minimizes within-study effects (Turkeltaub et al.  ). When a single experiment reported multiple contrasts of interest, we, therefore, pooled them under the same subject group. We note that however, in all cases in which the studies reported more than one contrast of interest they were drawn from the same experiment (with very few exceptions; see Tables S1 and S2), so our strategy did not unfairly pool together partially independent observations and was practically almost equivalent to grouping by experiment. When an experiment failed to report significant activation for some ROIs, we used the lower number of subjects that had above threshold activations in all ROIs from a contrast of interest if this information was available. To validate the results of the main ALE analyses and to further assess the reliability of the ALE peaks found, we also carried out a leave-one-experiment-out procedure (LOEO; Eickhoff et al.  ) on the main FEF and IFJ localizer samples using the same foci grouping strategy. Since we found identical ALE peaks as in the main ALE analyses using 1000 threshold permutations, we performed the LOEO procedure with the same parameter to reduce computational times. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation control analyses \n  \nWe carried out two control analyses in the FEF and IFJ localizer samples to rule out potential biases in our main ALE results. As we were mainly interested in inferring the localization of the FEF and IFJ, we decided to include studies with partial brain coverage. We motivated this choice by accepting the tradeoff between having access to a larger sample of experiments for these regions, as opposed to having less sensitivity in detecting other regions that are consistently active during the tasks included (which, however, are not the main focus of the present study), but not reported simply due to the lack of whole-brain brain coverage. The inclusion of studies with partial brain coverage is, however, generally not recommended in ALE analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). In our first set of control analyses, we have, therefore, excluded those studies based on the FOV parameters reported in the study (see Tables S1 and S2) or the author\u2019s description of the fMRI data acquisition. This led to the exclusion of two experiments from the FEF sample (Amiez and Petrides  , and Berman et al.  ), and one study in the IFJ sample (Sreenivasan et al.  ). For this control analysis, the ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 with a minimum cluster size of 50mm . The second set of control analyses was carried out to rule out another potential source of biases, namely ROI analyses (M\u00fcller et al.  ). These analyses imply restricting the assessment of statistical significance by some form of spatial masking. In this case, we excluded all the studies that either carried out ROI analyses or that only reported their results for specific ROIs (or even only FEF and IFJ foci; see Tables S1 and S2). This led to an important decrease in both the FEF and IFJ localizer sample sizes (to 16 and 22 eligible experiments, respectively). The ALE parameters were set to 5000 threshold permutations and a voxel-level FWE of 0.01 with a minimum cluster size of 50\u00a0mm , as in our main localizer analyses. \n\n\n### Comparison method of the ALE clusters and peaks with previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, relationship to macro-anatomical information and the MMP1 \n  \nTo interpret our results more carefully, we compared the clusters obtained from our ALE main localizer analyses with the results from previous meta-analyses results and brain atlases (Derrfuss et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ; Klein and Tourville  ; Paus  ). First, we described the anatomical location of each cluster and assigned the corresponding BA using the Talairach Daemon in GingerALE (Lancaster et al.  ). Second, to compare our results with previous meta-analyses (Derrfuss et al.  ; Paus  ), we mapped our ALE peaks to the Talairach space using the transformation developed by Lancaster et al. ( ) with GingerALE (MNI (FSL) to Talairach; see Table  ). Third, to relate our results to surface-based atlases (Klein and Tourville  ; Glasser et al.  ), we followed two distinct approaches. The Mindboggle 101 atlas (Klein and Tourville  ) describes the macro-anatomical organization of the human brain as delineated by sulcal and gyral information. The atlas was recently mapped to the MNI152 non-linear symmetric template (Manera et al.  ), thus we manually imported this atlas in FSL and in FSLeyes as described in this GitHub repository:  . We assigned one of the Mindboggle 101 labels to each of the ALE peak coordinates using the atlasquery command-line tool with FSL (v. 6.0.3; Jenkinson et al.  ). For atlases that were released and best interpreted in a surface format, such as the MMP1 (Glasser et al.  ; see Coalson et al.   for an in-depth discussion), we instead employed the mapping technique developed in Wu et al. ( ) to register our ALE results from the MNI152 space to FSaverage (Fischl et al.  ). A version of the MMP1 mapped to the FSaverage surface was made available using the method described in Mills ( ;  ). Once we mapped the ALE clusters to this surface, we also mapped the MNI152 coordinates corresponding to each ALE peak to a vertex on the inflated surface and we assigned each of these to the respective MMP1 labels (Table  ). To describe the anatomical labels associated with each ALE cluster using more specific labels (compared to the Talairach Daemon), we used a volumetric version of this atlas for convenience. The source files that were used to import the atlas are the same as in Huang et al. ( ). The volumetric version of the MMP1 was manually imported in FSLeyes as described in this GitHub repository:  . \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling method \n  \nWe exploited the ALE peaks obtained from the main localizer analyses to perform a data-driven analysis of the coactivation patterns of the FEF and the IFJ across the whole brain to uncover their task-based fMRI functional connectivity fingerprint (Langner and Camilleri  ). We, therefore, retrieved all the papers matching specific criteria (described below) from the BrainMap database using Sleuth ( ; Fox and Lancaster  ), and we analyzed these foci by employing the MACM technique (Langner and Camilleri  ). This technique leverages the ALE algorithm and allows inferring all the regions that coactivate with a given seed region that is selected a priori. This analysis also allowed us to perform a reverse inference on these coactivation patterns (Poldrack  ). More specifically, we sought to functionally decode and characterize the various behavioral domains that are significantly associated with each of these using a standardized taxonomy (Fox et al.  ) via the Mango software (v. 4.1) behavioral analysis plugin (v. 3.1; Lancaster et al.  ). \n\nThe studies were retrieved from the BrainMap database using Sleuth according to the following fields (all linked using the \u2018AND\u2019 operator): in the Experiment field, the \u201ccontext\u201d field was set to \u201cnormal mapping\u201d, in the \u201cactivation\u201d field we searched for \u201cactivations only\u201d, with \u201cImaging modality\u201d being set to \u201cfMRI\u201d. Finally, four separate searches were conducted in the BrainMap database by setting the \u201clocations\u201d field as corresponding to each left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) seed region (LH FEF, RH FEF, LH IFJ, and RH IFJ). We first transformed each seed location from MNI152 to Talairach space (which is the standard in Sleuth and also used internally by Mango\u2019s behavioral plugin) using the transformation by Lancaster et al. ( ; the FSL transformation) and we created cuboid seeds of 6\u00a0mm centered around the respective ALE peaks. With these criteria, we were able to retrieve a range of 19 to 53 studies across seed locations. We retrieved 26 studies (27 experiments) for the LH FEF seed, 19 studies (19 experiments) for the RH FEF seed, 53 studies (59 experiments) for the LH IFJ, and 31 studies (31 experiments) for the RH IFJ. We note that the different number of studies retrieved possibly reflects a combination of the increased base probability of finding activations within a specific ROI (Langner et al.  ) but also the fact that some ROIs tend to participate in multiple functional networks (Langner and Camilleri  ), which seems to fit well with the role of the IFJ in the frontoparietal network (Cole et al.  ). Crucially, these sample sizes allowed for adequately powered inference using ALE (Eickhoff et al.  ). Therefore, we used all the foci retrieved separately from each seed location as inputs for GingerALE. The ALE parameters were set to an 0.001 uncorrected   p   value, 1000 threshold permutations, and a cluster-level FWE of   p  \u2009<\u20090.01. In the functional decoding analysis, we used the same 6\u00a0mm cuboid seeds as in the MACM analysis centered around the respective FEF and IFJ ALE peaks. Associations with behavioral domains were considered statistically significant when their   z   score was\u2009\u2265\u20093, corresponding to a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (Bonferroni corrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### FEF and IFJ localizer samples ALE main clusters \n  \nIn the FEF localizer sample, the activations converged most strongly in two main clusters localized in the left and right posterior dorsolateral PFC. Two ALE peaks were found near the junction of the sPCS with the SFS, localized in the anterior (in the LH) and posterior (in the RH) banks of the sPCS (Fig.\u00a0 ). These peaks match well the classical description of the human FEF as inferred with fMRI (Petit and Pouget  ; Vernet et al.  ). Our LOEO procedure overall confirms the reliability of the localization of these ALE peaks (see Table  ; LH: 26\/35; RH: 23\/35). In the IFJ localizer sample, the activations converged most\u00a0strongly in two main clusters localized in the left and right posterior ventrolateral PFC. These clusters extended both in the dorsal and ventral portion of the iPCS, partially encroaching on the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The cluster in the right hemisphere was slightly smaller and spatially more focused compared to the cluster in the left hemisphere. Crucially, in both clusters, we found that the ALE peaks were localized along the posterior bank of the iPCS, near its ventral junction with the IFS, which closely matches the description of the IFJ (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ). Again, our LOEO procedure overall suggests that these ALE peaks are highly reliable across experiments (see Table  ; LH: 31\/32; RH: 24\/32).   \nFEF and IFJ localizer samples\u2014ALE main clusters.   A   ALE results from the FEF localizer sample. Two main clusters were found in the posterior dorsolateral PFC, which corresponds to the description of the anatomical location of the FEF (Paus  ; Vernet et al.  ). The FEF peaks were localized at the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, in the anterior (in the LH) and posterior (in the RH) banks of the sPCS.   B   ALE results from the IFJ localizer sample. Two main clusters were found in the posterior ventrolateral PFC, and their respective peaks were localized along the posterior bank of the iPCS, near its ventral junction with the IFS. The location of these peaks and the corresponding MNI152 coordinates match the description of the IFJ (Derrfuss et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ) \n  \n\n\n### FEF localizer sample ALE results\u2014FEF lateral peak and other significant clusters \n  \nIn the left hemisphere, we also found a lateral peak within the main FEF cluster, which was localized on the bank of the iPCS, dorsal to its junction with the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This lateral peak corresponds to what has been previously referred to as the inferior or the lateral FEF (Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Luna et al.  ). In addition to the main FEF clusters in the left\/right PFC, the ALE technique revealed three other consistently activated clusters. These clusters were localized in the medial frontal gyrus and the left\/right posterior parietal cortex (Table  ). The cluster in the medial frontal gyrus comprised the SCEF (Amiez and Petrides  ) and the dorsal cingulate motor cortex (Glasser et al.  ). In the posterior parietal cortex, two bilateral superior clusters spanned the precuneus and the SPL (Scheperjans et al.  ,  ), and an additional cluster was found in the right anterior intraparietal area (Glasser et al.  ; Numssen et al.  ).   \nFEF localizer sample ALE results\u2014FEF lateral peak and other significant clusters. In the FEF localizer analysis, we also found a lateral peak in the LH, which was localized near the bank of the iPCS, dorsal to its junction with the IFS, corresponding to the iFEF (Derrfuss et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ). It is unclear whether this region should be considered part of the FEF proper (Glasser et al.  ; Mackey et al.  ). We found three other significant clusters localized in the supplementary and cingulate eye field (SCEF) and the dorsal cingulate motor cortex, and the precuneus\/superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the right anterior intraparietal area. These areas form some of the core control structures of the oculomotor network (Coiner et al.  ) \n    \nFEF localizer sample ALE results \n  \n\n\n### IFJ localizer sample ALE results\u2014other significant clusters \n  \nIn addition to the main IFJ clusters in the left\/right PFC, we found seven consistently activated clusters forming a broad frontoparietal network (see Fig.\u00a0 ). In the frontal cortex, the first cluster was localized in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and SCEF (Amiez and Petrides  ; Glasser et al.  ), a second in the left precentral gyrus (within the putative FEF), and finally, two other clusters were localized in the bilateral insular cortex and claustrum (Table  ). Posteriorly, we also found a cluster in the left SPL\/inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and a smaller cluster in the right SPL\/IPL (Numssen et al.  ; Scheperjans et al.  ,  ).   \nIFJ localizer sample ALE results\u2014Other significant clusters. In addition to the bilateral IFJ clusters, we found significant activations in the dACC\/SCEF, the left FEF, in two clusters in the insular cortex and claustrum (not visible in the\u00a0LH), and finally, in the SPL\/IPL. Given that these areas were activated across different paradigms, we suggest that they could be associated with the \u201cencoding and updating of task-relevant representations\u201d as first hypothesized by Derrfuss et al. ( ; see also Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.  ). These areas mostly belong to the frontoparietal network (Yeo et al.  ) \n    \nIFJ localizer sample ALE results \n  \nNA = Not Available \n  \n\n\n### Control analyses ALE results \n  \nThe results of the control analysis excluding studies with partial brain coverage replicated our main localizer results, both in terms of the inferred ALE peaks and of the number and anatomical localization of the significant clusters. In the FEF sample, the ALE peaks coincided with the main analysis, and the only difference that emerged was a minor shift of the left iFEF peak (from MNI152:\u2009\u2212\u200948,\u2009\u2212\u20092, 40 to\u2009\u2212\u200946,\u2009\u2212\u20092, 38). In the IFJ sample, the ALE peaks again coincided with the results of our main analysis. The results of the second control analysis where we excluded all ROI analyses again matched well with our main results in terms of the inferred ALE peaks but had important differences regarding the number and anatomical localization of the significant clusters. The results of this control analysis are reported in the Supplementary Information (see Tables S6 and S7 for the FEF and IFJ samples, respectively). In the FEF sample, the cluster with the highest ALE value was now localized primarily in the left medial frontal gyrus, including the SCEF. The second and third larger clusters were, however, again localized in the left and right FEF, respectively, and were of the same size approximately. The inferred FEF ALE peaks were almost identical to our main results (LH main:\u2009\u2212\u200928,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 54 vs no ROI control:\u2009\u2212\u200928,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 56; and RH main: 30,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 50 vs no ROI control: 28,\u2009\u2212\u20096, 50; all the coordinates are in MNI152 space). However, in contrast to our main analysis results, the left FEF cluster did not spread onto the iPCS and there was not any peak corresponding to the iFEF. Interestingly, we also found a second peak in the right FEF cluster, which was lateral relative to the first, although still localized within the sPCS (40,\u2009\u2212\u20094, 50). In the IFJ sample, the most prominent\u00a0clusters were localized in the left and right IFJ, replicating our main analysis results. Their ALE peak exactly matched those from our main results in the left hemisphere (\u2212\u200942, 6, 30) but had some slight differences in the right hemispheres, where we found two peaks with similar ALE values (main: 46, 12, 28 vs no ROI control: 46, 10, 26, and 42, 8, 30). This indicates some residual variability in the localization of the right IFJ, which was not detectable in our main analysis results. \n\n\n### Spatial relationship of the main FEF and IFJ ALE\u00a0clusters and peaks with previous coordinate-based meta-analyses, macro-anatomical information and the MMP1 \n  \nThe comparison of the FEF and IFJ ALE peaks from the localizer samples analyses overall shows good spatial correspondence with results from previous meta-analyses and the MMP1, but with some important differences that are worth examining in detail (see Table  ). The FEF ALE peaks from our results are localized much more medially and posteriorly relative to the results reported in Paus ( ), highlighting marked spatial differences with this landmark FEF meta-analysis. In contrast, the IFJ ALE peaks are virtually identical to those reported in the study by Derrfuss et al. ( ; with slightly less agreement in the RH), where the authors also employed the ALE technique in one of its earlier implementations. Macro-anatomically, according to the Mindboggle 101 atlas (Klein and Tourville  ; Manera et al.  ), the LH FEF and RH FEF peaks lie within the caudal middle frontal gyrus (in BA 6) and not in the precentral gyrus, as previously assumed based on non-human primate evidence (Bruce et al  ; Schall et al.  , and Tehovnik et al.  , for reviews). These results are consistent with the few pieces of evidence available on the delineation of this region based on cytoarchitecture in   post-mortem   studies (Rosano et al.  ; Schmitt et al.  ). While the left IFJ ALE peak was found in the precentral gyrus (in BA 6), interestingly the right IFJ ALE peak was instead localized within the pars opercularis (in BA 9). The distinctive architecture of the IFJ remains elusive, but these peaks agree with the evidence that this area is localized in several Brodmann areas (BA6, 8, 9, 44 and 45), and may correspond to a specific cyto- and chemo-architecture found dorsal to BA44 (Amunts and Von Cramon 2006; for a recent fine-grained analysis of its architecture see Ruland et al.  ).   \nComparison of the ALE peaks with previous meta-analyses and brain atlases \n  \n\nFinally, in our opinion, the most interesting results of these comparisons were those obtained from the projection of our main FEF and IFJ clusters on the FSaverage surface using the method from Wu et al. ( ) where we could carefully examine their spatial relationship with the MMP1 (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The FEF clusters covered almost the entire middle and anterior part of the FEF (as defined by the corresponding MMP1 label) but also large parts of the middle and posterior 6a region. Moreover, the left and right hemisphere ALE peaks were found within area i6-8 and area 6a, anteriorly and dorsally relative to the FEF, respectively. The IFJ clusters instead spanned multiple MMP1 labels, including areas PEF, 6r, IFJp and IFJa. While in the left hemisphere, the majority of the vertices of the cluster were localized in the middle and posterior aspect of the IFJp, in the right hemisphere most of the vertices were localized in the ventral 6r region. Crucially, in both hemispheres, however, the ALE peaks were localized in the latter region, ventral to the IFJp.   \nProjection on FSaverage of the FEF and IFJ main clusters and comparison with the MMP1.   A   Vertices corresponding to the FEF clusters. Both clusters covered the middle and rostral parts of the FEF label as defined according to the MMP1 atlas, but they also covered large parts of area 6a. In the LH, vertices were also localized in the iFEF, which matches almost exactly the boundaries of area PEF from the atlas. The LH FEF ALE\u00a0peak was localized within area i6-8, just anterior to the FEF, and the RH FEF ALE\u00a0peak was localized within area 6a, dorsal to FEF. Despite this difference, both peaks were localized near the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, in the anterior bank and the posterior banks of the sPCS, respectively.   B   Vertices corresponding to the IFJ clusters. They showed a similar elongated shape that approximately followed the posterior iPCS and encroached onto the IFS, and they spanned multiple MMP1 areas. Importantly, we found that in both hemispheres the IFJ ALE\u00a0peaks were localized near the junction of the iPCS and the SFS within area 6r, posteriorly to the IFJp \n  \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling results \n  \nThe MACM analysis of the FEF and IFJ revealed a broad set of regions that coactivated with these seeds in the BrainMap database encompassing the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The LH FEF seed coactivated with six other clusters (see Fig.\u00a0 A), and the RH FEF coactivated with eight other clusters (Fig.\u00a0 B). Interestingly, while these FEF coactivations included as expected medial oculomotor regions (the SCEF) and the SPL\/IPL, in both analyses we found coactivated clusters in the bilateral ventral PFC, which included parts of the iFEF and the IFJ based on their localization relative to the iPCS and the IFS. The LH IFJ coactivated with a broad set of other nine clusters (Fig.\u00a0 C), and the RH IFJ coactivated with five other clusters (Fig.\u00a0 D). The coactivations of these bilateral seeds spread onto the IFS and ventrally in the insular cortex and claustrum. Again, these coactivations included clusters in the SCEF, the SPL\/IPL and the angular gyrus. In contrast to the FEF coactivations, where the bilateral IFJ was always coactivated, we did not find FEF coactivations in the IFJ MACM results, except for the ipsilateral FEF in the LH IFJ MACM analysis. Another crucial difference was that in this analysis, we found a large cluster in the left temporal lobe that included the fusiform gyrus and the inferior occipital cortex. We confirmed these patterns by performing an ALE contrast analysis between the FEF and IFJ MACM results in each hemisphere (see Supplementary Information p. 23). To summarize, while the FEF MACM analysis showed that this region is consistently coactivated with the ventrolateral PFC and regions in the posterior parietal cortex across paradigms, the IFJ had more widespread coactivation patterns (particularly in the LH), being more strongly connected with the rest of the PFC and with the insular cortex and claustrum, and possessing a differential connectivity pattern with regions of the inferior temporal cortex. In contrast, we found differential coactivations of the LH and RH FEF with the ipsilateral precuneus\/SPL and lateral intraparietal areas. In addition to revealing the task-based functional connectivity fingerprint of these regions, our functional decoding approach also allowed us to uncover the behavioral domains significantly associated with each of them (Fig.\u00a0 , right side of each panel; see Supplementary Information p. 23 for a summary of these results).   \nMeta-analytic connectivity modeling results.

On the right side of each panel: decoding results of the significant associations with behavioral domains (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, Bonferroni corrected) \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe PFC is essential to several aspects of flexible goal-driven behavior that are mediated by specialized brain regions (Fuster  ; Miller and Cohen  ; O\u2019Reilly  ). The FEF and the IFJ have been primarily implicated in covert spatial attention and oculomotor control on the one hand (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Vernet et al.  ), and attention, working memory, and cognitive control on the other (Bedini and Baldauf  ; Brass et al.  ). Their localization has been traditionally associated with the major sulci of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the SFS and the sPCS, and the iPCS and the IFS, respectively (Amiez et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ). Due to the large body of empirical work that has accumulated over the past years on these regions (Bedini and Baldauf  ) and the parallel development of more robust meta-analytic techniques for neuroimaging data (Fox et al.  ), we felt the need to re-examine the previous results in light of the current evidence, with a specific focus on overcoming discrepancies in the definition and localization of these regions using fMRI in humans. In particular, in this study, we sought to accurately estimate the precise localization of these regions in standard space by performing a coordinate-based meta-analysis using the ALE technique (Eickhoff et al.  ). To model the spatial convergence of activations within the FEF, we analyzed data from 35 fMRI studies (35 experiments) that investigated the planning and execution of prosaccades and antisaccades contrasted against a fixation baseline in 449\u00a0subjects. To model the spatial convergence within the IFJ, we analyzed data from 30 fMRI studies (32 experiments) that investigated visual attention, working memory, and cognitive control, in 563\u00a0subjects. In contrast to previous ALE meta-analyses that relied on the false discovery rate (Derrfuss et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ), our study implemented a much more conservative method for multiple comparisons correction, namely voxel-level FWE, following the recommendations of Eickhoff et al. ( ). We also included only higher field fMRI studies (3\u00a0T and 4\u00a0T) to make our inference spatially more reliable. Moreover, testing for significance in each voxel individually enabled us to carry out a fine-grained assessment of activations across experiments. Crucially, we found that by modeling activity across studies (thus partially overcoming inter-individual variability), sulcal landmarks are indeed consistently associated with both regions, as indicated by the location of the ALE peak values (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). Our results thus suggest a robust association of structure and function in these higher PFC regions (Frost and Goebel  ; Miller et al.  ; Van Essen  ; Wang et al.  ), analogous to what previous studies have shown in early visual regions (Benson et al.  ; Hinds et al.  ). We suggest that this association should be examined by future fMRI studies more systematically at the individual-subject level (Amiez et al.  ; Amiez and Petrides  ; Derrfuss et al.  ,  ). Given the limitations of previous meta-analyses (Derrfuss et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ; Paus  ), we recommend using the coordinates reported in the present study to define the FEF and IFJ based on the ALE technique. \n\n### FEF localization in standard space \n  \nThe FEF is arguably one of the most important regions of a network involved in the planning and execution of saccadic eye movements and has been extensively studied in primates (Schall et al.  ; Tehovnik et al.  ). In humans, this network comprises a set of regions in the lateral and medial frontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and subcortical nuclei (Corbetta et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ), and has been mainly investigated with fMRI over the past 25\u00a0years, enabling to characterize their respective functions (Coiner et al.  ; McDowell et al.  ). Following the crucial foundation set by non-human primate neurophysiology (Bruce et al.  ; Buschman and Miller  ; Moore and Fallah  ), the human FEF has not only been implicated in visually guided and voluntary saccades, and other oculomotor behaviors (Vernet et al.  ), but also in covert shifts of spatial attention, spatial working memory, and also more complex executive functions (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Vernet et al.  ). Converging lines of research suggest that the FEF acts as a spatial priority map (Fiebelkorn and Kastner  ; Jerde et al.  ; Sprague and Serences  ). The localization of the human FEF is, however, highly debated and affected by strong spatial variability (Bedini and Baldauf  ; Vernet et al.  ), possibly due to inter-individual differences that are obscured when reporting group-level results. Previous ALE meta-analyses provided evidence of consistent activations within FEF across PET and fMRI experiments investigating prosaccades and antisaccades (Cieslik et al.  ; Grosbras et al.  ; Jamadar et al.  ). However, given the coarser spatial resolution of PET and low-field strength MRI scanners (i.e., 1.5\u00a0T) and acquisition methods that were included in these previous meta-analyses, these studies were only partially able to accurately infer spatial convergence across experiments, as well as dissociations across paradigms and contrasts. In addition, some of these studies relied on earlier implementations of the ALE technique, which allowed for within-study effects (Turkeltaub et al.  ), and critically, more liberal statistical thresholds and multiple comparisons correction methods (Eickhoff et al.  ). Finally, another aspect that is difficult to evaluate retrospectively was the finding of two\u00a0errors in the multiple comparisons correction step in earlier implementations of GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ), which presumably\u00a0affected the meta-analyses published prior to that report. In this study, we attempted to overcome some of these limitations by applying a conservative multiple comparisons correction method and by including higher field fMRI studies (i.e., 3\u00a0T or 4\u00a0T) to accurately infer the localization of the human FEF in standard space. Our ALE results, obtained by analyzing prosaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation, antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation, and prosaccades and antisaccades\u2009>\u2009fixation contrasts across 35 fMRI experiments (see Table S1), show that the highest spatial convergence based on the ALE value was found within two bilateral clusters in the dorsolateral PFC, localized in the anterior bank of the sPCS, near its junction with the SFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table  ). The comparison with one of the most comprehensive brain parcellations available to date (the MMP1 by Glasser et al.  ) revealed some interesting spatial relationships with our results. We found that the FEF ALE peaks did not match the corresponding label from the atlas, suggesting that there may be important differences in the way the FEF is defined across methods. The MMP1 was created by a careful semi-manual delineation combining structural MRI (cortical thickness and myelin ratio), resting-state fMRI connectivity, and retinotopic mapping techniques (Glasser et al.  ). Additionally, fMRI contrasts from nine tasks were also employed to infer areal boundaries, which were chosen to optimally balance breadth vs depth and scan time (Elam et al.  ). Although we regard the MMP1 as a step change in our understanding of brain organization, and of the fine-grained organization and structure of the PFC in humans and non-human primates (Donahue et al.  ), we would like to suggest that more information gathered from task-based fMRI will be needed to better understand the functional subdivision of the posterior-lateral PFC. More specifically, following the labeling scheme proposed by the MMP1, major efforts should be made to isolate FEF activity from posterior activity in the premotor cortex on the one hand (area 6d), and from a newly discovered language selective region (area 55b) that borders the FEF ventrally on the other (Glasser et al.  ). Ultimately, future developments of a functional localization method will facilitate the convergence of atlas-based and meta-analytic fMRI information to allow the delineation of anatomical clusters of activation within FEF with adequate functional specificity. \n\nIn this direction, the seminal fMRI study by Mackey et al. ( ) identified three distinct visual field maps in the PFC localized in the sPCS (sPCS1 and sPCS2) and the iPCS. By examining the correspondences between their results and the MMP1 (see Fig.\u00a08 from their study), they found that the sPCS2 corresponded to the FEF, while the sPCS1 corresponded to areas 6a and 6d. Interestingly, they also reported that in all subjects and both hemispheres, the foveal representation was localized in the fundus of the sPCS, at its intersection with the SFS. This description closely matches the localization of our ALE peaks, which raises the question of whether the fMRI contrasts we included in the present meta-analysis could be targeting specific neural populations within the FEF. It is well established that in the macaque, a population of neurons shows increased firing rates when the animal is fixating and is inhibited when executing saccades (hence termed \u2018fixation\u2019 neurons; Hanes et al.  ; Lowe and Schall  ). Are these neural populations also present in humans, and how are they distributed within the FEF? What is the role of saccadic amplitude in isolating peaks of activity within the FEF (see Grosbras  )? An additional aspect that may be worth investigating is whether the activations found in one or more of these clusters (for example, the iFEF) are dependent on some artifacts present in the experimental design or analysis. In the 35 experiments we analyzed, 10 did not record eye movements in the scanner (see Table S1), leaving open the possibility that some of these clusters may have also been driven by spurious neural activity that was not exclusively related to saccadic behavior. It is well documented that eye blinks can contaminate BOLD signal (Bristow et al.  ; Hup\u00e9 et al.  ), and this fact was invoked to explain discrepancies in the oculomotor organization in primates (Tehovnik et al.  ) and as a signal driving iFEF responses (Amiez and Petrides  ; Kato and Miyauchi  ). In conclusion, we strongly agree with the general caveat that the way the FEF is defined is ultimately constrained by the technique employed (Schall et al.  ; Vernet et al.  ), and in particular its spatial resolution. The localization and the extent of the FEF cluster should be inferred based on the convergence of multiple criteria (primarily architectonic, sulcal, functional, connectional, and also comparative). In the present study, we provided a standard using ALE, which we suggest can lead to clarifying how inter-individual variability affects FEF localization and its relationship to sulcal organization (Amiez et al.  ; Glasser et al.  ). Refinements in the careful mapping of the human FEF will be essential to bridge research in humans and non-human primates and for testing hypotheses about homologies in the organization of the PFC across species, for example, based on connectivity information (Hutchison et al.  ; Mars et al.  ; Neggers et al.  ; Sallet et al.  ). \n\n\n### IFJ localization in standard space \n  \nThe study of the role of the ventrolateral PFC in various cognitive functions such as visual attention, working memory, and cognitive control led to the definition of the IFJ as a separate brain region involved in critical aspects of all these functions (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Brass et al.  ; Derrfuss et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ). This region appears to be tightly coupled with specific sulcal landmarks (Derrfuss et al.  ) and belongs to the frontoparietal network (Cole and Schneider  ; Yeo et al.  ). In this study, we pooled together results from the various tasks that have been used to localize this region (see Table S2) ranging from attentional (i.e., RSVP\/oddball; Asplund et al.  ; and endogenous cueing paradigms; Baldauf and Desimone  ; Zhang et al.  ), working memory (primarily n-back paradigms; Rottschy et al.  ; Zanto et al.  ), and cognitive control paradigms (i.e., task-switching and Stroop tasks; Derrfuss et al.  ). Following a previous ALE meta-analysis (Derrfuss et al.  ), we reasoned that the spatial convergence across these paradigms (rather than a single task and\/or contrast) would allow us to accurately infer the localization of the IFJ in standard space. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found two prominent clusters of activation in the ventrolateral PFC. Based on the ALE peak values, the highest convergence was found in the posterior bank of the iPCS, approximately at the height of its ventral junction with the IFS (see Fig.\u00a0 ; Table  ). The comparison of these results with the MMP1 revealed additional interesting topographic differences. The IFJ ALE peaks were localized just ventral and slightly posterior to the corresponding labels from the atlas (IFJa and IFJp), and the ALE clusters included vertices from several other brain regions. These results suggest that many of the paradigms that target the IFJ will also tend to involve adjacent multiple-demand regions, which may conceal its exact boundaries. \n\nAn interesting approach combining different paradigms and using a conjunction analysis to localize the IFJ was presented by Stiers and Goulas ( ), which may overcome some of the previous limitations. The authors analyzed the voxel responses across three different tasks (Eriksen flanker task, back matching or n-back task, and a response scheme switching task) to define the prefrontal nodes of the multiple-demand system in 12 subjects. A manipulation of task difficulty in each of the previous tasks was used to identify voxels that were modulated by increasing cognitive demands, which were used to define ROIs in each subject in a conjunction analysis across tasks for further analyzing their relative task preference and functional connectivity patterns. This analysis revealed local maxima of activity within the IFJ, where voxels with different task preferences exhibited distinct functional connectivity patterns with the rest of the brain (Stiers and Goulas  ). Based on these results, it may be argued that no single task alone would adequately capture the selectivity patterns of neural populations within the IFJ; rather, manipulations of task difficulty combined with the administration of different paradigms could provide an unbiased way of localizing this region in individual participants. The present study provides a standard using ALE, which should help further understand how inter-individual variability affects IFJ localization and its relationship to sulcal organization (Derrfuss et al.  ). Future meta-analyses should better clarify how activations from different tasks that tap cognitive control functions map onto the ventro-lateral PFC and assess whether they may recruit distinct subregions near the IFJ (Nee et al.  ), which was, however, outside the scope of our present work (see Rodr\u00edguez-Nieto et al.   for a comprehensive meta-analysis). \n\n\n### Whole-brain coactivation patterns of the FEF and IFJ \n  \nAn additional\u00a0goal of the present study was to uncover the task-based functional connectivity fingerprint of the FEF and the IFJ in a data-driven fashion. We retrieved from the BrainMap database all the studies that reported activations within a cuboid seed centered around the FEF and IFJ standard coordinates found in our ALE main localizer analyses and we employed the MACM technique to uncover their coactivation profiles (Langner and Camilleri  ). Importantly, while previous studies already performed MACM analyses on the FEF (Cieslik et al.  ; Genon et al.  ) and the IFJ (Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Sundermann and Pfleiderer  ), our study is to our knowledge the first that used this technique on the results of an ALE analysis specifically aimed at localizing these regions (and not a manual or atlas-based delineation) using a narrow seed extent (6\u00a0mm). Our MACM analysis allowed adequately powered inference in each seed region (Eickhoff et al.  ) and revealed broad networks of coactivations that encompassed the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The most remarkable differences between FEF and IFJ coactivation patterns were that on the one hand, the LH FEF\u00a0and RH FEF coactivated with the bilateral ventrolateral PFC (iFEF and IFJ), whereas only the LH IFJ coactivated with the LH\u00a0FEF in the experiments retrieved. On the other hand, the LH IFJ had stronger and more widespread coactivations in PFC and the insular cortex and was also coactivated with the inferotemporal cortex. These coactivation patterns may be essential for the IFJ to perform its role in feature- and object-based attention tasks (Baldauf and Desimone  ; De Vries et al.  ; Liu et al.  ; Liu  ; Meyyappan et al.  ; Soyuhos and Baldauf  ; Zhang et al.  ) and could be in turn supported by its underlying anatomical connectivity patterns (Baldauf and Desimone  ; Bedini et al.  ). These results are consistent with the idea of a dorso-ventral segregation of frontoparietal coactivations forming a \u2018spatial\/motor\u2019 and a \u2018non-spatial\/motor network\u2019, which are in turn associated with the first and third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, respectively (Parlatini et al.  ). In addition, the MACM contrast between the coactivation patterns of FEF and IFJ fit very well with a recent report of these regions\u2019 functional connectivity in source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data, which showed stronger connectivity of the\u00a0FEF with the dorsal \u2018where\u2019 visual pathway (especially in the alpha and beta bands), and stronger connectivity of the\u00a0IFJ with the ventral \u2018what\u2019 visual pathway (especially in the delta and gamma bands; Soyuhos and Baldauf  ). Finally, our functional decoding results suggest that these systematic coactivation patterns allow these regions to support multiple yet specialized roles in flexible goal-driven behavior (Assem et al.  ; Genon et al.  ; Muhle-Karbe et al.  ; Ngo et al.  ; Ruland et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study provides the accurate localization of two regions of the posterior-lateral PFC, namely the FEF and the IFJ. These regions are tightly coupled with sulcal landmarks as measured using fMRI across over 400 and 500\u00a0subjects,\u00a0respectively, with the FEF being localized at the junction of the sPCS and the SFS, and the IFJ at the junction of the iPCS and the IFS. Functionally, they appear to be organized according to a dorso-ventral gradient, going from areas responsible for sensorimotor transformations and action execution (FEF, iFEF), to areas that are involved in maintaining and updating behavioral goals according to internal representations (IFJ; Abdallah et al. 2022; Nee et al.  ; O\u2019Reilly  ). Taken together, our findings aim at proposing a consensus localization of these regions in standard space, and meta-analytic groundwork to investigate the relationship between functional specialization and connectivity in large publicly available neuroimaging datasets (e.g., Markiewicz et al.  ; Van Essen et al.  ), as well as to guide future non-invasive brain stimulation studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":10147761,"text_md5":"26b332bf8ad605062a5e14b62455d36d","field_positions":{"authors":[0,75],"journal":[76,94],"publication_year":[96,100],"title":[111,249],"keywords":[263,392],"abstract":[405,2404],"body":[2413,77122]},"batch":2,"pmid":37093304,"doi":"10.1007\/s00429-023-02641-y","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10147761","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10147761"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC10147761\">10147761<\/a>","list_title":"PMC10147761  Accurate localization and coactivation profiles of the frontal eye field and inferior frontal junction: an ALE and MACM fMRI meta-analysis"}

We adopted the Activation Likelihood Estimation technique to obtain a quantitative summary of previous fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies of acceptance and test different hypotheses on its mechanisms of action. The main meta-analysis included 13 experiments contrasting acceptance to control conditions, yielding a total of 422 subjects and 170 foci of brain activity. Additionally, subgroups of studies with different control conditions (react naturally or focus on emotions) were identified and analysed separately. Our results showed executive areas to be affected by acceptance only in the subgroup of studies in which acceptance was compared to natural reactions. In contrast, a cluster of decreased brain activity located in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)\/precuneus was associated with acceptance regardless of the control condition. These findings suggest that high-level executive cortical processes are not a distinctive feature of acceptance, whereas functional deactivations in the PCC\/precuneus constitute its specific neural substrate. The neuroimaging of emotional acceptance calls into question a key tenet of current neurobiological models of emotion regulation consisting in the necessary involvement of high-level executive processes to actively modify emotional states, suggesting a complementary role for limbic portions of the default system. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRecognition of the value of emotional acceptance for emotional well-being has philosophical and religious roots that date back thousands of years ( ). In the context of the scientific investigation, acceptance has been conceptualized as a regulation strategy based on an open and welcoming attitude towards emotions, thoughts or events ( ). It consists of a mental stance characterized by openness and a non-judgemental attitude towards on-going emotional experiences ( ;  ), without trying to control, change, suppress or avoid them. Acceptance also refers to a sense of curiosity about emotions. This entails a perspective that does not see emotions and thoughts as threatening, but rather as mental phenomena that are temporary, transient, interesting or at least neutral, sources of information about one\u2019s current mental state, and not to be feared, changed or expunged. Early mentions of theoretical issues relevant to acceptance emerged from the thought suppression literature, which argued for the paradoxical pathogenetic effects of attempts at mental contents control ( ;  ). More recently, the revival within clinical psychology of ancient Buddhist traditions of mindfulness meditation\u2014a set of techniques that raise awareness by paying attention in a non-judgmental way to mental activity ( )\u2014has led to a growing interest in the adaptive value of non-judgemental attitudes towards emotions as a means to achieving positive mental health effects. This line of inquiry has produced evidence that emotional acceptance may be effective in diminishing emotional reactivity and physiological arousal in response to aversive emotions ( ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, self-reported acceptance may positively influence perceived daily stress ( ) and is associated with better mental health outcomes ( ;  ). Based on the findings on its effect on coping with negative emotions and stress, acceptance may be considered as an emotion regulation strategy ( ;  ). \n\nThe relevance of emotional acceptance to mental health is also widely recognized in clinical practice. It occupied a position of primary importance in early humanistic\u2013experiential therapy approaches ( ;  ;  ). More recently, acceptance-based techniques have been proposed as a specific therapeutic factor in mindfulness-based interventions (where they play a prominent role,  ), dialectical behaviour therapy ( ), acceptance and commitment therapy ( ;  ), schema therapy ( ,  ), short-term dynamic therapies ( ;  ) and emotion-focused therapy ( ;  ). Acceptance-based treatments have been shown to be effective in the treatment of several forms of psychopathology ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). More generally, in most psychotherapy approaches, patients are encouraged to freely observe and explore their own mental activity. Hence, acceptance may be considered a non-specific, common outcome across different psychotherapy approaches ( ;  ). \n\nThe unquestionable clinical relevance of acceptance, however, is in contrast with the poor empirical investigation of this emotion regulation strategy in the clinical and affective neurosciences, at least when compared to other strategies (such as reappraisal). A reason of this relative neglect can be attributed to the fact that acceptance was not originally considered by influential models of emotion regulation (such as Gross\u2019s process model,  ). In this respect, the concept of acceptance breaks with the established tradition in affective neuroscience that identifies emotion regulation with cognitive control, as this latter is recruited \u2018to actively modify an emotional state in terms of quality, strength, length, or frequency of emotion\u2019 ( ). Within the affective neurosciences, evidence for this view of emotion regulation has been sought in neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, in which participants were exposed to negative emotional stimuli and were instructed to modify (the opposite of acceptance) their emotional reactions ( ). In these studies, findings of increased activation of cortical areas associated with working memory and executive function\u2014such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex\u2014together with decreased activity in subcortical areas (the amygdala) have been marshalled in support of a dual-process model that describes emotion regulation as the result of interactions between prefrontal cognitive control systems accounting for \u2018top-down\u2019 modulation and subcortical systems that support \u2018bottom-up\u2019 emotional reactivity ( ;  ;  ). Even if some acceptance instructions included attentional components, which would account for the involvement of controlled processes (see  ), they always precluded any deliberate attempt to modify emotional states. Therefore, the resulting response comes much closer to a \u2018let it be\u2019 non-interference attitude towards emotions, thoughts and bodily reactions associated with emotions, which consequently differs substantially from emotional control. In the following, we will refer to emotion regulation strategies based on changing affect aroused by stimuli as the \u2018traditional\u2019 strategies to distinguish them from acceptance-based strategies. \n  \nOverview of acceptance studies included in the meta-analysis \n  \nN foci A > C = Number of foci for acceptance versus control condition. \n\nN foci C > A = Number of foci for control condition versus acceptance. \n\nIAPS = International Affective Pictures System. \n\nGAD = Generalized Anxiety Disorder. \n\nF = female. \n  \nDue to the relevance of top-down control in traditional emotion regulation models, a first question of this study regarded the involvement of executive areas in acceptance-based regulation. Neuroimaging studies of acceptance have provided mixed evidence in this respect. In some studies, prefrontal activations of the dorsal attention network have been reported in acceptance, consistently with recruitment of cognitive control as in traditional emotion regulation strategies ( ;  ). In other studies, even if prefrontal activations were reported, they were less than in traditional strategies and\/or located more medially ( ;  ;  ). Finally, yet other studies reported that acceptance of emotions occurred in the absence of detectable increases in prefrontal cortical areas associated with top-down control ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nBesides executive areas associated with cognitive control, the neuroimaging literature has drawn attention to the possible involvement of the Default Mode Network (DMN) ( ), a set of areas usually deactivated during attention-demanding tasks ( ) associated with mind-wandering ( ;  ;  ). Since mind-wandering has been considered as the opposite of mindfulness ( ), it has been suggested that the \u2018interruption\u2019 of ruminative processing that characterizes mindfulness-based emotion regulation strategies may modulate the DMN activity ( ). This suggestion is consistent with findings of hyper-activation of the DMN in depression ( ;  ), anxiety ( ) and more in general in conditions of emotional dysregulation ( ;  ). A further reason to investigate the involvement of the DMN is its relationship with semantic association areas ( ). In the context of emotion regulation, the DMN and the surrounding association cortex have been hypothesized to be involved in regulation by modulating semantic processing of emotional stimuli ( ;  ,  ). \n\nIn summary, the strategy of acceptance to regulate emotions calls into question a key tenet of current neurobiological models of emotion regulation, consisting in the involvement of top-down control associated with recruitment of cortical areas associated with working memory and executive processes. Available studies have produced mixed evidence concerning the involvement of substrates of the executive system. An alternative hypothesis consists of the modulation of the activity of the DMN. To shed light on this issue, we adopted a meta-analytic approach, which allowed us to combine data across neuroimaging studies with a similar experimental design. In the present study, the coordinates-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method ( ) was used to obtain an objective, systematic and quantitative summary of previous neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation which have considered acceptance as emotion regulation strategy. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nNeuroimaging studies on acceptance were collected through advanced searches in Google Scholar ( ) and PubMed ( ) of all articles that mentioned in the title the terms \u2018acceptance\u2019 and\/or \u2018mindfulness\u2019 together with the terms \u2018fMRI\u2019 (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or \u2018neuroimaging\u2019. Additional studies were obtained reviewing the references of papers using the Google Scholar database. We excluded from the retrieved studies those that investigated neural effects of meditation or meditation trainings, that involved meditators participants and that investigated acceptance and\/or mindful attitude as a personality trait. We included all studies that used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of acceptance using a typical emotion regulation design in which participants were exposed to emotional stimuli and instructed to use acceptance to regulate emotional reactions compared to a control condition (see   for a review of stimuli and task instructions). As shown in  , when operationalizing acceptance, researchers use different instructions, stressing one or more components of acceptance, such as willingness to take in emotions, being present (mindfulness), cognitive defusion, self as a context, and concentration on values and commitment. This variety of instructions has been previously observed also in reviews of behavioural studies ( ;  ). Following these criteria, a total of 10 papers and more than 400 participants were examined (the main features of included studies are shown in  ). All reported significant reductions of negative emotions in the acceptance condition, compared to the control condition (with the exception of   that did not report behavioural results). Studies with two different experimental conditions ( ) or with different groups of participants analysed separately ( ;  ) were considered as separate samples (these studies are reported in   as \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 to mention different conditions), yielding a total of 13 studies. From these studies, we extracted foci reported in three-dimensional (3D) coordinates (  x, y, z  ) in stereotactic space that resulted significantly activated for the contrast between an acceptance regulation condition   vs   a control condition (increased brain activity in acceptance) and control condition   vs   acceptance regulation (decreased brain activity in acceptance). Verbatim instructions of acceptance regulation and control conditions are reported in  . \n\nAmong the selected studies, we noted that two subgroups of studies differed in the control condition used in the experimental design. In the first subgroup (Contrast to Natural Reaction\u2014CNR), in the control condition, participants were instructed to naturally \u2018look\u2019 or \u2018react\u2019 to the experimental stimuli. In the second subgroup (Contrast to Focus on Emotions\u2014CFE), more complex instructions were given to increase the focus of participants on their emotional experience. Example of these instructions was \u2018to focus on the specific feelings\u2019 ( ) or \u2018become completely absorbed by feeling\u2019 ( ). Due to possible systematic discrepancies in the patterns of brain activity across studies attributable to differences in control conditions used as baseline for contrast analysis, we also conducted explorative meta-analyses of CNR and CFE subgroups considered separately. Among the 13 studies, 7 experiments were included in the CNR subgroup, and 6 experiments were included in the CFE subgroup. \n\n\n### Meta-analytic procedure \n  \nTo conduct the meta-analyses, the ALE method for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data was used ( ). This method is based on the evaluation of the overlap between foci of brain activity reported in different studies and treats the reported foci not as single points, but as centres for 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing their spatial uncertainty. An algorithm is used to identify clusters of brain activity that show a convergence of activation across experiments and determine if the clusters obtained occur more frequently than in the null distribution arising from random spatial distribution of foci across the experiments. The procedure weights foci of brain activity reported in single studies by the number of participants, yielding a quantitative estimate of the probability of activation identifying common activations across studies ( ). Significance values were obtained with permutation tests. The observed values in the ALE distribution are then compared to the null distribution in order to assign probability estimates to the observed data. \n\nALE meta-analyses were carried out using GingerALE 2.3.2 software as distributed by the BrainMap project ( ). The \u2018non-additive\u2019 method was used, which models each focus with a Gaussian function defined by a full width at half-maximum kernel size empirically determined by finding the maximum across each focus\u2019s Gaussian. The non-additive method allows the modelling of the spatial uncertainty of each focus arising from inter-subject and inter-study variability. The meta-analyses were performed in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Coordinates reported in studies in Talairach coordinates space were transformed into MNI using the Lancaster transform, icbm2tal algorithm in Ginger ALE ( ). The probability maps were threshold at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 and corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate approach ( ). SurfIce software ( ) was used to obtain brain renderings. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of all acceptance studies \n  \nThe analysis of the contrast between acceptance   vs   all control conditions included the data collected from 13 experiments, for a total of 422 subjects, yielding 61 foci of brain activations. No significant clusters of increased brain activity emerged from this analysis. \n\nThe analysis of the contrast between the control conditions   vs   acceptance included the data collected from 10 experiments (3 experiments did not analyse this contrast; see   for information concerning reported foci of brain activity), for a total of 364 subjects, yielding a total of 109 foci of significant brain activity. A significant cluster of decreased brain activity in the acceptance condition relative to control emerged from this analysis. This cluster was located in the posterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus (PCC), insula and limbic subcortical areas such as the thalamus and the parahippocampal gyrus (see  ;  ). \n  \nFoci of significant brain activity in control conditions compared to acceptance condition \n  \nBA, Brodmann\u2019s areas. \n    \nDecreased (cold colours) and increased (warm colours) brain activity associated with all acceptance studies (A), CFE studies (B) and CNR studies (C). \n  \n\n### Explorative subgroup analyses \n  \n#### CNR subgroup. \n  \nSeven experiments reported results of the contrast acceptance   vs   natural reactions, yielding a total of 164 subjects, and 38 foci of brain activations. Four clusters of increased brain activity were found for acceptance relative to control. These clusters were located bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus, extending to the anterior insula and the putamen on the left side and to the frontal pole and the medial prefrontal cortex\/anterior cingulate cortex (see  ). \n  \nSignificant clusters of brain activity in CNR and CFE subgroups \n  \nFour experiments reported results of the contrast natural reaction   vs  , acceptance, yielding a total of 106 subjects, and 15 foci of brain activations. Significant clusters of decreased brain activity in acceptance relative to natural reaction were located in the posterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus (PCC), right hippocampus and right superior temporal gyrus (see  ). \n\n\n#### CFE subgroup. \n  \nWith regard to the analysis of the contrast acceptance   vs   focus on emotions (increased brain activity for acceptance), 6 experiments reported significant results and were included in the analysis, yielding a total of 258 subjects, and 23 foci of brain activations. No significant clusters emerged from this analysis. \n\nIn the contrast focus on emotions   vs   acceptance, 6 experiments reported significant results, yielding a total of 258 subjects, and 94 foci of brain activations. One significant clusters of decreased brain activity in acceptance relative to focus on emotion was located in the posterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus (PCC), thalamus and parahippocampal gyrus. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present meta-analytic study, we provided a synthesis of functional neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of regulating emotions through acceptance-based strategies, in which participants were instructed to take on a non-judgemental attitude towards on-going emotional experiences, contrasted to naturally react or focus on negative emotions control conditions. Due to their relevance for neurobiological models of emotion processing and regulation, we were interested in clarifying the involvement of executive areas and of the DMN in the acceptance strategy. \n\nWhen we tested the presence of increased brain activity in all studies included in the present meta-analysis (the main contrast acceptance   vs   control conditions)\u2014despite decreased activity in limbic regions in acceptance (thalamus and hippocampus\/parahippocampal gyrus) accounting for regulation efficacy ( ;  )\u2014no areas associated with executive processes resulted to be significantly activated by acceptance (or indeed any other cortical area). This result is in line with previous studies that reported the absence of increased activity in executive areas, and more generally with reports of the absence of increased brain activity in association with acceptance in the whole brain ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, when we explored the involvement of substrates of executive functions in two different subgroups of studies differing in the control condition contrasted to acceptance, we found a significant increased activity in executive areas only in the subgroup of studies characterized by the use of natural reaction as the control condition (Contrast to Natural Reactions\u2014CNR; e.g. \u2018  react naturally  \u2019). In contrast, no significant clusters of increased brain activity were observed in studies that used more complex instructions related to increasing the focus on emotional experience (Contrast to Focus on Emotions subgroup\u2014CFE; e.g.   \u2018become completely absorbed\u2019  ). \n\nThe involvement of executive areas is consistent with previous attempts to conceptualize acceptance as a specific variety of reappraisal ( ;  ) and with the presence of attentional element in acceptance instructions (see  ). However, this effect was not significant when acceptance was compared to control conditions requiring some amounts of cognitive load (CFE), even if these control conditions did not include instructions to down-regulate emotional response. The increased activity of executive areas only in the CNR subgroup may result from a difference in cognitive effort between the acceptance and the natural reaction control conditions, rather than a specific regulation effect. Indeed, the prefrontal effects of acceptance in the comparison with the natural reaction control condition in the CNR group overlapped with those reported in a meta-analysis of the effects of task difficulty across tasks ( ). \n\nBeyond the effects of acceptance in executive areas associated with top-down control, a remarkable aspect of many of these studies is given by frequent reports of decreased activity in acceptance relative to the control conditions, even in studies in the CNR subgroup ( ;  ;  ). These findings are upheld by the second result of the present study, which was the decrease of brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)\/precuneus, posterior insula and limbic lobe in the acceptance compared to control conditions. There are two reasons for attributing this effect to acceptance, rather than to the control conditions. First, this finding was obtained regardless of the control condition. The PCC cluster was significant also when considering the two CNR and CFE subgroups separately, even if these groups differed in the control conditions they used. Second, previous meta-analyses of traditional emotion regulation studies ( ;  ), did not report effects in this area in any of the considered contrasts, even if these meta-analyses were conducted on a larger database of studies than the present one. \n\nHowever, effects in the PCC have been reported in individual studies in the emotion regulation literature. Activations of PCC have been reported in emotion regulation processes that, on the contrary of acceptance, have included aspects of emotional avoidance. For instance, PCC modulations have been reported in self-distancing from negative emotional pictures ( ), in down-regulating the reaction to a negative stimulus by self-distraction ( ), in association with amount of eye movements to directing gaze so as to avoid aversive emotional stimuli ( ) and in association with individual differences in spontaneous avoidance of emotional words ( ). PCC activity modulation has also been observed after psychotherapy ( ). Thus, emotional avoidance and acceptance studies seem to show two sides of the same coin, possibly highlighting a neglected component of emotion regulation which has its neural correlate in the PCC. Future studies, specifically designed to test the association of PCC activity modulation with effective down-regulation of negative affect, may provide further evidence in support of this hypothesis. \n\nWith regard to the nature of the contribution of PCC to emotion regulation, the literature offers several hypotheses. A first interpretation emerges from considering brain activity as the result of activation and deactivation patterns in large-scale connected networks ( ). The PCC is a key part of the DMN, associated with mind-wandering ( ;  ;  ) and ruminative processes ( ;  ). Hence, the present findings would be consistent with the hypothesis that modulations of PCC activity during acceptance may be associated with the interruption of ruminative, self-reflective processes over emotions (especially when acceptance is compared to focus on emotion, which can be viewed as related to ruminative processes). Also, the posterior insula may contribute to this process, due to its role of bringing visceral sensation to the posterior network ( ;  ). Note, however, that ruminative processes, which may be expected to be most prevalent during the baseline or fixation phase rather than in a control condition, were not directly investigated in the studies included in the present meta-analysis. \n\nA second alternative interpretation of the present findings posits that PCC would be normally activated in response to emotional stimuli and the use of acceptance strategy may modulate this activation appearing as decreased activity in the contrast with control conditions. This interpretation also accounts for the fact that in the meta-analysis, only PCC, and not the whole DMN as in mind-wandering, was found to be modulated by acceptance. However, a study specifically looking at this issue found that PCC was deactivated while appraising emotional material relative to the fixation baseline ( ). \n\nA third interpretative approach, which is also compatible with the hypothesis of interruption of ruminative processes associated with DMN modulations, recognizes deactivation of PCC as the neural substrate of acceptance. The idea of functional deactivations related to stimulus processing is not new in the literature ( ). Research and theories are converging on the notion of brain function as computing a hierarchical predictive model of the world in which functional processing hierarchies are not confined to sensorimotor systems but terminate in heteromodal association areas where predictions are generated ( ). The most innovative aspect of these models is to realize that these heteromodal association areas are organized around a core constituted by the DMN ( ), which is usually deactivated by the task. Indeed, together with cortical limbic areas, heteromodal association areas are precisely those where functional deactivations are observed ( ), justifying the current interest on neural inhibition as a mechanism to select representations at the top of the sensory processing hierarchy ( ). This suggests that a simple dichotomy between top-down and bottom-up processes may not adequately describe emotion regulation processes as a whole ( ). \n\nIn line with this notion, the role of cortical limbic areas, including the PCC, has been recently redefined considering their involvement in representing sensory input based on past experience, placing them at the top of the predictive hierarchy ( ). Mental processes implicated in avoidance   vs   acceptance of emotional reactions may be associated with recruitment of specific hubs of the DMN, in which deactivations of PCC are functionally related to acceptance. Hence, emotion regulation may act at this level of cortical processes influencing the impact of emotional events independently of the involvement of high-level executive cortical processes, instead modulating emotion processing through the recruitment of emotional and schematic representations ( ,  ;  ). \n\nThe insights gained in the present study may be useful to understand the mechanism of psychotherapy. The traditional conceptualization of emotion regulation as a form of cognitive control is only partially compatible with models of psychotherapy. Considering the neural substrates of emotional and schematic representations may help elucidate the mechanisms of cognitive restructuring of dysfunctional cognitions that characterize cognitive-behavioural therapies ( ), where this restructuring has been shown to be a mediator of the therapeutic outcome ( ;  ). In contrast, the concept of cognitive control is not consistent with the putative mechanism of action of \u2018expressive\u2019 psychotherapy approaches, which encourage individuals to experience their emotions, related thoughts and bodily sensations fully to put them in contact with their own internal experiences (instead of controlling emotions). These mechanisms also appear to apply to psychodynamic therapies ( ;  ) and \u2018third-wave\u2019 behavioural therapies ( ,  ). In this context, we have argued for limiting the importance of executive functions only to specific forms of emotion regulation, emphasizing the importance of enlarging neurobiological models of emotion regulation beyond cognitive control ( ,  ). Moving the focus of emotion regulation models from executive to semantic processes may bridge the gap between clinical models of psychotherapeutic interventions and affective neuroscience. Regardless of the specific psychotherapy model, psychotherapy theories are often concerned with changes in semantic representations of the self, past experiences interpersonal situations (including the therapeutic relationship) that function as \u2018schemas\u2019 ( ) or internal working models ( ) to organize and interpret the emotional significance of everyday emotional experiences. \n\nThe present study has some limitations. First, the number of studies that have investigated acceptance-based regulation strategies is relatively exiguous. Due to the scarcity of available studies, we were not able to statistically compare the interaction between acceptance and the CNR and CFE subgroups (contrast analysis is unlikely to have enough statistical power to show significant differences with less than about 15 experiments in each data set). Second, the analyses provided here using the ALE methodology were based solely on reported peak activation coordinates. Therefore, we were unable to take into account information on the whole extent of estimated effects. Third, the definition of acceptance, together with instructions provided to the participants, remains somewhat inconsistent in the literature. For example, some definitions emphasize the attention to body sensations, whereas others are more focused on emotions and thoughts. All these issues should be considered in future studies. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7943364,"text_md5":"d4070e6aa20d79eae1ff9e91f243f603","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,85],"publication_year":[87,91],"title":[102,235],"keywords":[249,350],"abstract":[363,1863],"body":[1872,30364]},"batch":2,"pmid":33475715,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsab007","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7943364","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7943364"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7943364\">7943364<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7943364  Neurobiological models of emotion regulation: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of\u00a0acceptance\u00a0as\u00a0an\u00a0emotion regulation strategy"}
{"text":"Spindler, Carolin and Trautmann, Sebastian and Alexander, Nina and Br\u00f6ning, Sonja and Bartscher, Sarah and Stuppe, Markus and Muehlhan, Markus\nSci Rep, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nMeta-analysis of grey matter changes and their behavioral characterization in patients with alcohol use disorder\n\n# Keywords\n\nAddiction\nAddiction\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAlcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is associated with reductions in grey matter (GM) volume which can lead to changes in numerous brain functions. The results of previous studies on altered GM in AUD differ considerably in the regions identified. Three meta-analyses carried out between 2014 and 2017 yielded different results. The present study includes the considerable amount of newer research and delivers a state-of-the art meta-analysis in line with recently published guidelines. Additionally, we behaviorally characterized affected regions using fMRI metadata and identified related brain networks by determining their meta-analytic connectivity patterns. Twenty-seven studies with 1,045 AUD patients and 1,054 healthy controls were included in the analysis and analyzed by means of Anatomical Likelihood Estimation (ALE). GM alterations were identified in eight clusters covering different parts of the cingulate and medial frontal gyri, paracentral lobes, left post- and precentral gyri, left anterior and right posterior insulae and left superior frontal gyrus. The behavioral characterization associated these regions with specific cognitive, emotional, somatosensory and motor functions. Moreover, the clusters represent nodes within behaviorally relevant brain networks. Our results suggest that GM reduction in AUD could disrupt network communication responsible for the neurocognitive impairments associated with high chronic alcohol consumption. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) has a high worldwide prevalence and is associated with an enormous health burden, as well as increased mortality . AUD also leads to impairments and problems at work (e.g., not meeting job requirements), elevated risk of injuries (e.g., endangerment or traffic accidents) and negative consequences in social and family contexts (e.g. neglect of social relationships, aggression toward family members) . \n\nAUD trajectories are characterized by changes in numerous cognitive and affective processes that play a vital role for disorder development, maintenance and relapse . Continuously high levels of alcohol consumption can lead to long-term functional changes, such as impairments in visuo-spatial functioning, i.e. perceiving and remembering locations  and in higher cognitive functioning, such as self-control, planning, inhibition, reasoning and explicit emotion regulation . Changes in affective processes such as emotional instability  and mood disturbances may also be related to heavy alcohol consumption  and might explain the high co-morbidity of AUD with depressive disorders . AUD-induced impairments of cognitive and affective functions are furthermore associated with poorer therapeutic outcomes . \n\nAmong other factors, functional impairments in AUD can be explained by changes in grey matter (GM) structure, resulting from the neurotoxicity of alcohol in chronic high consumption patterns . Numerous studies indicate widely distributed GM volume reductions in AUD patients compared to healthy controls . The results of these individual studies refer to various cortical and subcortical regions that are altered by alcohol consumption. However, the identified brain regions vary considerably across these different studies. The inconsistency of individual neuroimaging results may be explained by study characteristics such as sample size, comorbidity, analytical and experimental variability . In order to interpret the existing findings and quantitatively integrate effects across individual studies, meta-analytic approaches have been developed . Thus far, three meta-analyses  integrated the results of studies that analyzed GM changes in AUD patients compared to healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM ). Xiao et al.  identified nine eligible VBM studies (published from January 2000 to November 2014) and included neuroimaging data from 269 AUD patients compared to 359 healthy controls in an effect-size based meta-analytical approach. Their resulting meta-analytic maps indicated significantly reduced GM in both hemispheres comprising parts of the prefrontal cortices (PFC), anterior cingulate cortices (ACC), striatal and insular regions and parts of the posterior cingulate cortices (PCC) in AUD patients compared to healthy controls. \n\nYang et al.  identified twelve eligible VBM studies (published from January 2000 to December 2014). They also compared whole-brain GM differences between 433 AUD patients and 498 healthy controls with an effect-size based meta-analytical approach. In this meta-analysis, AUD patients showed decreased GM in the left and right insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG), striatum, precentral gyri, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) as well as the left thalamus and right hippocampus, relative to healthy controls. \n\nA third meta-analysis conducted by Klaming et al.  examines shared GM changes across AUD and posttraumatic stress disorder. They conducted meta-analyses for each condition compared to healthy controls. Here we only report the results on the AUD vs. HC contrast. The authors identified thirteen eligible studies (published from January 2000 to December 2017) and included the data of 456 AUD patients compared to 522 healthy controls in another effect-size based meta-analytical approach. Their results indicate GM reductions in AUD patients in middle and anterior cingulate cortices, insulae and lenticular nuclei and superior frontal gyri of both hemispheres. \n\nIn sum, prior studies have shown changes in GM volume of different brain regions that may be subject of functional changes in AUD. Three meta-analyses have integrated the existing evidence from GM changes in AUD over a period from 2000 to 2017. The results from all three meta-analyses indicate GM changes located in different parts of the PFC, ACC, striatum and the insulae. However, the studies also differed markedly in their results. The findings from Xiao et al.  of reduced GM in the left and right posterior cingulum were not replicated, instead, Yang et al.  additionally detected GM alterations in left and right precentral gyri as well as in subcortical regions like the left thalamus and right hippocampus. Klaming et al.  did not identify these subcortical regions, but additional clusters in the left and right superior frontal gyri. Those inconsistencies could be due to methodological differences (e.g. differences in inclusion criteria or liberal statistical thresholds). Furthermore, according to the current guidelines , the three meta-analyses are also underpowered (insufficient number of included studies), which bears the risk that the results are driven by a few dominant study results. \n\nThe aim of our study was therefore to re-visit the area of GM changes in AUD and to calculate the convergence of the individual findings using a state-of-the-art meta-analysis. Moreover, since 2017, new studies have continued to investigate the links between AUD and changes in GM. The inclusion of a larger number of studies facilitates the detection of smaller effects, increases robustness to generalizations, and may help resolve divergent previous findings . Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE)  was chosen as the method of analysis. It ensures an excellent spatial weighting of the isolated coordinates. Additionally, we extend prior findings by characterizing the resulting ALE-clusters with regard to their behavioral profile using metadata from the BrainMap database . This data-driven approach provides a better understanding of behavioral profiles related to AUD. Finally, we perform a meta-analytic connectivity modelling analysis (MACM)  using the same database to determine in which neural networks the resulting clusters could represent potential nodes. This behavioral profile and MACM approach provides a reliable basis for future functional analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nDetails of the protocol for this meta-analysis were registered on PROSPERO and can be accessed at  . \n\n### Literature search, study selection and data extraction \n  \nThe search for neuroimaging studies investigating GM differences in patients with AUD and healthy controls was conducted on PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases (up to June 1, 2020) and by reference-tracing of the retrieved articles. Keywords were: (Alcohol Dependence OR Dependence, Alcohol OR Alcohol Addiction OR Addiction, Alcohol OR Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic OR Chronic Alcoholic Intoxication OR Intoxication, Chronic Alcoholic OR Alcohol Use Disorder OR Alcohol Use Disorders OR Use Disorder, Alcohol OR Use Disorders, Alcohol OR Alcohol Abuse OR Abuse, Alcohol) AND (voxel-based morphometry OR VBM OR structural MRI). We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) written in English language and peer-reviewed, (2) statistical comparison of GM voxel-based-morphometry data from a group of patients diagnosed with AUD (DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10) and a healthy control group. We refer to AUD (as specified in DSM-5) as a disorder continuum subsuming DSM-IV criteria of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence as well as ICD-10 criteria of harmful use and dependence syndrome of alcohol . (3) Results were reported as 3-D coordinates in a standard reference space (e.g. MNI or Talairach) . \n\nExclusion criteria comprised (1) review-studies, meta-analyses and re-analyses, (2) region of interest analyses, small volume corrected results and experiments with only partial brain coverage, (3) methodological studies and study protocols, (4) studies with small sample sizes (<\u200910 per group) and (5) studies with statistical approaches not correcting for multiple comparisons or setting a minimum cluster extension as statistical threshold for significance . Unlike conventional meta-analytical methods, (6) studies reporting null-findings could not be taken into account because they do not provide spatial coordinates, which are a prerequisite for coordinate based methods like the ALE . (7) Studies investigating patient groups with Korsakow syndrome, with other primary psychopathology or comorbid other substance use disorder (except for nicotine) and studies investigating adolescent samples were also excluded. The flow of information through the different phases of the literature search is shown in Fig.\u00a0  and is orientated on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-Statement) .   \nFlow diagram on the different phases of the systematic literature search.  Differences in numbers of excluded articles and exclusion reasons result from studies excluded because of multiple exclusion criteria. \n  \n\nThe data of the eligible studies was manually extracted (C.S.) and double-checked by a second investigator (M.M.). The extraction included demographic sample characteristics, methodological characteristics and the peak voxel coordinates of the experiments reported in the studies included in the meta-analysis. In four studies, the peak voxel coordinates were not explicitly reported. For two of these studies, the data was provided after personal correspondence with the authors . \n\nIn order to assess risk of bias and for quality assessment, C.S. and M.M. independently checked for concordance with recently published guidelines for neuroimaging meta-analysis . Except for one study, only GM decreases in AUD patients compared to healthy controls (HCs) were reported. In the study that reported both peak voxel coordinates for the contrast AUD\u2009<\u2009HCs as well as AUD\u2009>\u2009HCs , we pooled the foci into one experiment for the analysis as recommended to avoid dependence across experiment masks. In eight additional studies (Supplementary table  ), we suspected a potential sample overlap even though it was not explicitly stated in the manuscript, since the studies were published from the same research group and they included patients from the same hospitals and sociodemographic and psychometric data were approximately comparable. To further minimize the risk of bias, we have also pooled their foci into one experiment and thus adopted a conservative approach by considering the smaller sample size. To take the potential of publication bias into account, conventional detection methods as for effect-size meta-analyses cannot be applied in the ALE-approach . Therefore, a post-hoc noise simulation, referring to a modified version of the fails-safe N (FSN)\u00a0method , was applied for estimation of robustness against unpublished findings. \n\n\n### Anatomical likelihood estimation \n  \nTo detect above-chance convergence among the reported coordinates we conducted the meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry imaging results by applying a technique of anatomical likelihood estimation that is derived from the principles of activation likelihood estimation . The analysis was performed using BrainMap GingerALE v3.0.2 ( ). Coordinates reported in Talairach space were transformed into MNI space using the Lancaster transform icbm2tal implemented in GingerALE . \n\nIn the first step, ALE models the input coordinates with a Gaussian function, which accommodates the spatial uncertainty of the reported coordinates (e.g., resulting from variance in neuroanatomy or caused by the use of various brain templates and normalization strategies) and takes the sample size of each experiment into account . In the second step, a map of the whole brain is constructed for each experiment, assigning to each voxel a value equal to the probability that a volume difference between patients and healthy controls lies within the voxel. Across all experiments, these maps are merged and yield the ALE image with the ALE values that represent the likelihood that volume differences were found at least for one experiment at a given voxel . The statistical significance of the ALE scores is tested in the third and last step. A cluster level family wise error correction (cFWE) with   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 was used as the cluster-forming threshold and   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 was used as the FWE threshold, since they entail low susceptibility to false positives in terms of convergence . In cFWE thresholding, the experimental ALE scores are tested against a null hypothesis utilizing a permutation procedure with 1000 permutations based on the identical number of foci, subjects, and experiments to generate random datasets. Where appropriate, specific subgroups will be investigated by additional analyses. \n\n\n### Analysis of behavioral domain profiles and paradigm analysis \n  \nIn order to assess mental processes that can be associated with the identified ALE clusters, a behavioral profile was generated using the \u201cBehavioral Analysis Plugin Version 3.1\u201d for Mango 4.1 ( ). This plugin automatically compared the identified ALE clusters with functional metadata of the BrainMap Database ( ). BrainMap\u2019s behavioral domains are Action, Cognition, Emotion, Interoception and Perception, subdivided into sixty sub-domains. At that time (July 8 , 2020), the BrainMap functional database contained 3.628 papers with 18,079 experiments. Before the behavioral analysis was conducted, the ALE clusters were stored as binary masks and transformed into the Talairach space using the MNI-to-Tal transform option in Mango ( ). The comparison of the proportions of behavioral domains found within the selected cluster with the proportions of the behavioral domains across the whole BrainMap database results in a behavioral domain profile of the selected clusters.   Z  -Scores\u2009\u2265\u20093.0 with   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons) are considered significant . In addition to the behavioral analysis we also conducted a regional paradigm analysis using the \u201cParadigm Analysis Plugin Version 1.6\u201d for Mango v4.1. Here, the results of the comparison of our ALE clusters and the literature in the BrainMap Database are presented for 111 paradigm classes that also characterize functional metadata. For paradigm analysis, the significance threshold is set at   Z  -Scores\u2009\u2265\u20093.3 with   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons;  ). \n\n\n### Meta-analytic connectivity modeling \n  \nTo examine the functional networks of the ALE-derived clusters we used a region-to-whole-brain meta-analytic connectivity modeling approach (MACM) . Such analysis is based on the co-occurrence of spatially separated neurophysiological events and \u2013 when used in conjunction with the BrainMap database \u2013 results in a large-scale analysis that includes decades of neuroimaging data. Thus, MACM is a data-driven method, performed using BrainMap Sleuth v3.0.4 and BrainMap GingerALE v3.0.2 ( ) that is useful for identifying connections within an indirect network. \n\nFirst, we acquired anatomical seed regions of interest (ROIs) of our ALE-clusters using Mango v4.1. Next, we transformed and stored them as Talairach images as required for Sleuth\u2019s image search capability. We conducted our search using Sleuth with the anatomical seed ROIs and the following additional search criteria: \u201cDiagnosis: Normals\u201d, \u201cContext: Normal Mapping\u201d, \u201cImaging Modality\u2009=\u2009fMRI OR PET\u201d and \u201cActivations: Activations Only\u201d. The identified co-activation coordinates were exported as input data for GingerALE. We then conducted a quantitative meta-analysis applying the ALE-algorithm as described previously (corrected for multiple comparison with cFWE-corrected threshold with   p  \u2009<\u20090.05), resulting in areas of convergence among the co-activation coordinates . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwenty-seven studies were eligible and therefore included in the meta-analysis. These studies entail a total 1,045 AUD patients and 1,054 HCs. After pooling the foci as described in the methods section, the ALE was calculated over 23 experiments with 376 reported peak voxel coordinates . Demographic and clinical sample characteristics of the studies included are presented in Table   and Fig.\u00a0  displays the foci-distribution of the included experiments. Further information about data acquisition and data analysis of the individual studies can be found in Supplementary Table  .   \nDemographic and clinical sample characteristics of the studies included in the ALE meta-analysis. \n  \nAUD\u2009=\u2009alcohol use disorder, Fem.\u2009=\u2009females, d\/w\/mo\u2009=\u2009days\/weeks\/months, n.a.\u2009=\u2009information not available. \n    \nFoci-distribution of the experiments included in the ALE meta-analysis.

( ). \n  \n\n### Significant ALE clusters \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis yielded eight significant clusters of convergence, named C1 to C8 according to their spatial extent (Fig.\u00a0 a,b), with C1 being the largest cluster. Four medial clusters (C1, C2, C4 and C7) cover parts of the anterior, middle and posterior cingulate gyri (58.3% of C1, 40.0% of C4 and 25.0% of C7), the medial frontal gyri (20.0% of C1, 39.3% of C2 and 55.0% of C4), the superior frontal gyri (21.7% of C1), the paracentral lobe (5.0% of C4 and 64.3% of C7), the anterior cingulate cortices (60.7% of C2) and the precuneus (10.7% of C7) in both hemispheres. The third cluster (C3) comprises the left postcentral and precentral gyri (63.5% and 36.5%). The right posterior\u00a0insula and claustrum are covered by C5 (88.6% insula and 11.4% claustrum) and left anterior insula and claustrum are covered by C6 (51.6% insula, 48.4% claustrum). The last cluster, C8, is located in the left hemisphere covering the superior frontal gyrus (42.9%), middle frontal gyrus (28.5%) and medial frontal gyrus (28.6%). The cluster sizes, the peak voxel coordinates and their ALE values, the center of mass as well as the number of contributing experiments can be found in Table  . In general, ALE does not allow any statement about the direction of the effects. However, all included studies reported a substance reduction and only one study reported an additional volume increase in AUD in the left cuneus . This region did not contribute to the identified ALE clusters. Thus, the clusters of this ALE analysis are considered as regions with reduced GM volume. Overall, 20 of the 23 included studies contributed to the ALE clusters. A detailed overview of the contributing studies per cluster is shown in Supplementary table  .   \nResults of the ALE meta-analysis. The highlighted clusters (C1\u2013C8) represent significant convergence about grey matter differences in AUD patients compared to healthy controls.

The Results show five clusters that largely converge with those of the main analysis (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C8). In contrast to the main analysis, there was no convergence in posterior cingulate gyri and insular regions. \n\nRetesting the resulting ALE-clusters with additional noise-studies in order to quantify the robustness against unpublished findings, the ALE-clusters remained significant from 13% up to 282% added noise. A detailed presentation of the FSN per cluster can be found in Supplementary table  . \n\n\n### Behavioral characterization and paradigm analysis \n  \nThe behavioral domain analysis of all clusters indicated that the identified pattern of structural changes is associated with several cognitive subdomains (attention, language, memory, music and reasoning), action subdomains (inhibition and execution), positive and negative emotion subdomains and perception subdomains of somesthesis (Fig.\u00a0 ). The paradigm analysis revealed significant associations for thirteen paradigm classes as depicted in Fig.\u00a0 . Separate behavioral domain and paradigm analyses for each cluster are shown in Supplementary Table  .   \nBehavioral domain profile of the ALE derived\u00a0cluster-network.

Besides these similarities, the MACM analysis for C1 revealed convergent co-activation for anterior cingulate as well as supramarginal gyri and C1, C4 and C6 show a dorsolateral-prefrontal extension of co-activation patterns. Another similar co-activation pattern of MACM-maps for C1 and C3-C6 can be found in regions of the left and right cerebellum. The co-activation patterns for C2 also encompass frontal-, limbic- and sub-lobar regions like medial- and superior frontal gyri and the anterior cingulate as well as thalami and lentiform nuclei, precuneus, posterior cingulate and cingulate gyrus. Additionally, the left (middle) temporal lobe and left and right amygdalae are covered here too. For C5, significant co-activation was mainly observed in superior temporal gyri and mid and posterior insulae, left and right thalami, lentiform nuclei and cingulate gyri as well as precentral and postcentral, medial, and superior frontal gyri. MACM-analysis for C7 revealed a convergent co-activation pattern in both hemispheres in paracentral lobes, medial frontal, and cingulate gyri, precuneus and right anterior insula, precentral gyrus and claustrum. The co-activation patterns of C8 encompasses superior and medial frontal gyri, cingulate gyri and the anterior cingulate in both hemispheres and left and right anterior insulae, inferior frontal gyri and claustrum. All MACM-Maps are shown in Fig.\u00a0 .

( ). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBy integrating the results of various studies on grey matter differences in AUD patients compared to healthy controls in a coordinate-based, meta-analytic approach, we identified eight significant clusters of convergence. These clusters indicate GM reduction in medial cortical regions such as anterior, middle and posterior cingulate gyri, frontal and superior frontal gyri, paracentral lobes and precuneus in both hemispheres. Additional clusters refer to GM reductions in left postcentral and precentral gyri, the left anterior and right posterior insulae and left superior frontal gyrus. The behavioral characterization of these clusters mainly revealed cognitive subdomains but also associations with subdomains of action, perception, and emotion. The results were further specified by analyzing the underlying paradigms, where a total of thirteen different paradigm classes with the highest effect size on reward-tasks were associated with our ALE clusters. A subsequent MACM analysis demonstrated a high degree of functional overlap within most of the clusters in lateral frontal and parietal as well as medial regions, in thalamic and insular regions. C2 additionally showed meta-analytic connectivity with left and right amygdalae and C1, C3-C6 were also linked to activation patterns in the left and right cerebellum. \n\nThe identified clusters are partially in line with the results from previous meta-analyses. In addition to the existing meta-analytical evidence, we identified clusters covering parts of the left and right paracentral lobes and the left superior frontal gyrus. Our analysis, however, did not replicate previous findings that include the right superior frontal gyrus or subcortical limbic regions like the right hippocampus, the left thalamus or the right lenticular nuclei and putamen. For prefrontal and insular regions, our results show more differentiated and less extensive clusters of convergence than previous meta-analyses. Several reasons might account for these differences. First, the applied methodology: Xiao et al. , Yang et al.  and Klaming et al.  used effect size based methods (ES-SDM and AES-DM, e.g. ), which makes their strategy different from to the ALE analysis used here. While ES-SDM and AES-DM combine peak voxel coordinates with effect sizes or use statistically parametric maps of the original data, ALE weights the local maxima with the sample size . Also, previous meta-analyses used more liberal statistical thresholds. Second, the number of included studies: our significantly larger number of studies compared to previous meta-analyses ensures that the findings are not skewed by a few very dominant study results . The number of studies in our analysis exceeds the minimum of 17 recommended in recently published good practice guidelines by M\u00fcller et al. . Third, the choice of studies: we excluded studies with adolescent samples  because of the dynamic changes in brain anatomy throughout adolescence (e.g. ). We further excluded a study with a subclinical sample  that was included in previous analyses. We had no access to the results of a study that was published in Chinese  (see Table  ). \n\nIn sum, the findings of earlier meta-analyses were partially replicated. Diverging findings are probably due to the choice of analysis method and statistical inference approaches as well as number and type of studies included. Although different methodological approaches identified clusters in some different brain regions, our MACM analysis suggests that the resulting clusters of previous meta-analyses and the clusters of convergence in the present meta-analysis are key nodes in the same brain networks as discussed below. \n\nWhile the main study question was quite broadly defined and we clarified which regions show a change in GM in AUD, a post-hoc sub-analysis was performed to investigate which regions show a change in GM volume, since most of the included experiments focus on this particular type of modulation of VBM data. The resulting ALE clusters overlap with 5\/8 of our main findings. The lack of convergence in regions of posterior cingulate gyri and insular regions can be explained by the contribution of experiments that examined density rather than volume in the main analysis . Thus, the methodological difference of modulated and non-modulated VBM data should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results . \n\nIn order to functionally characterize the ALE derived cluster-network, we generated a behavioral domain profile in comparison with meta-data from the BrainMap database. This data driven approach allows an interpretation unbiased by presumptions and prevents effects of reverse inference . The most strongly represented domain is that of cognition with subdomains indicating that the reduction of GM in AUD may be associated with changes in attention, language, memory, reasoning and music cognition. The findings are in line with a large number of studies showing changed attentional processes in AUD-patients that may be responsible for frequently reported attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli  or impairments of selective or divided attention, especially when semantic information is processed . Furthermore, it can be assumed that impairments of semantic speech understanding, working memory and explicit memory functions lead to numerous deficits because current (task) requirements are not adequately understood, or stored, or because language responses are given incorrectly. The identified regions are also associated with higher cognitive functions, such as the formation of conclusions or judgments, that are subsumed in the reasoning subdomain. Deficits in this cognitive domain might contribute to a lack of insight into harmful alcohol consumption or difficulties in maintaining abstinence. \n\nThe results also revealed an association between positive reward processing and the ALE clusters. These findings fit well with the assumption that AUD is associated with decreased reward sensitivity that deteriorates further in the course of the disorder . Reward processing and motor inhibition are also parts of the multidimensional construct of impulsivity which represents an important personality trait associated with psychopathology and the development and course of AUD (e.g. ). Furthermore, reduced cognitive control in combination with altered reward processing could lead to habitual behavior rather than goal-directed behavior, resulting, for example, in quick relapses into old consumption patterns for patients . \n\nThe perception domain indicated that the identified regions are also related to the sensory systems associated with the skin (somesthesis), including pain perception. The paradigm analyses showed that this result was mainly driven by pain-monitor\/discrimination tasks. This area of research seems to be underrepresented in alcohol use disorders . The literature in the field of pain and alcohol use\u00a0comprises\u00a0considerations on\u00a0bi-directional relations . For instance, Egli et al.  discuss\u00a0the contribution of\u00a0pain sensitivity\u00a0to alcohol misuse and addiction. They argue that\u00a0affective and sensory dimensions of pain\u00a0in abstinence\u00a0stages\u00a0contribute to alcohol misuse. This might be caused due\u00a0to\u00a0an intersection\u00a0of neural substrates that mediate\u00a0nociception as well as alcohol dependence.\u00a0They\u00a0further\u00a0argue\u00a0that\u00a0protracted abstinence in AUD\u00a0could exacerbate dysregulated nociception. Possibly impaired somesthetic discrimination abilities, as identified in the current analysis, might contribute to this phenomenon. \n\nFurther subdomains include motor and emotional aspects. The execution of language and other non-linguistic movements as well as the inhibition of movements could be assigned to the identified clusters. Restrictions in these functions, like fine motor skills or postural abilities, are among the core symptoms of the AUD and have been repeatedly reported (for review ). The subdomain Fear also showed a significant effect. This finding fits well with reports of increased sensitivity to threatening situations in AUD. The enhanced sensitivity of fear- and stress-associated systems can promote alcohol consumption and continues to increase in the course of the disorder . \n\nIn contrast to the previous domains, music cognition is rather difficult to assign in the existing literature. The conducted paradigm analysis explicitly revealed \u201cmusic production\u201d and \u201cmusic comprehension\u201d. While the first might be explained not only by deficits in cognitive processes but also by poor motor control (action: execution), it remains unclear to what extent deficits in music comprehension could be a burden for patients with AUD. \n\nFor a detailed description of all subdomains and paradigms see:  . \n\nThe MACM maps from the identified ALE-clusters overlap with well described nodes of several behaviorally relevant brain networks. Key nodes of the Salience Network (SN; dACC and Insulae)  were covered by C1, C3-C6 and C8. Since the metadata is based on task activations, SN co-activation could be expected . However, there is evidence that GM reductions in the SN have been associated with impairments of cognitive control and decision making in AUD patients . In addition, the MACM-Maps of C1, C3-C6 revealed connectivity patterns in cerebellar regions, which supports the findings of previous studies on impairments of cortico-cerebellar networks in AUD that may affect motor and working memory functions . Other MACM-clusters within dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal regions correspond to nodes of the attention and the control network (CN) as defined by Uddin et al. . Changes in these networks are likely to be responsible for the majority of impairments in higher cognitive and affective functions (e.g. updating, problem solving or response inhibition) in AUD (see  for a comprehensive review). Cluster 8, in the left inferior frontal cortex, can also be counted to the Control Network and has been associated with working memory and speech processing (e. g. ). The posterior insulae are covered by the MACM maps that correspond to cluster 5. The posterior insular regions have been associated with interoception and pain processing . GM reduction in these regions supports the findings from reduced functional connectivity  and may be responsible for altered interoceptive awareness in AUD and increased sensitivity to the effects of alcohol . Nodes of the Default Network  are covered by the MACM maps of C2. Changes in this network can lead to disturbances of self-referential control and social interaction . Furthermore, C2 MACM-analysis additionally shows co-activation in a fronto-striatal network (striatal, amygdalar and thalamic regions), indicating reward associated processes like reinforcement learning of craving, which play a key role in the development and maintenance of AUD . The connectivity maps of clusters C3 and C7 include regions related to visuo-spatial functions and motor control . Functional changes in these networks may be responsible for impairments in motor functions such as visuo-motor tracking or gait stability . \n\nSince the Behavioral Domain Analyses and MACM Analyses are based on the same meta-data; a further interpretation of potential dysregulated functions would be partially redundant. However, the data gives an indication in which functional brain networks the identified GM regions represent potential nodes. This offers important starting points for future research in the field of AUD. In particular, the analysis of network interactions could significantly contribute to the understanding of AUD . \n\nBesides the previously described extensions and methodological strengths of our results, some limitations need to be addressed. First, the studies included in our meta-analysis varied in terms of sample characteristics e.g. sex distribution or duration of abstinence (Table  ), which itself is reported to contribute to neuro-regeneration . Unfortunately, it is not possible to verify the effect of these potential confounding variables using meta-regressions in ALE. If sufficient individual studies with comparable sample characteristics are available, the confounding variables should be specifically investigated by means of sub-analyses. Further heterogeneities can be seen in methodological features of the included single-studies (suppl. Table  ). Differences in inference procedures for example might have led to false positive results. These in turn can be counteracted by applying more conservative correction methods, as we did in our meta-analysis, since the cFWE-correction entails low susceptibility to false positives in terms of convergence . Second, as already mentioned in\u00a0the methods section, a limitation of the coordinate-based algorithm we used lies in possibly unnoticed publication-bias, because of its insensitivity to non-significant results . However, the calculation of the FSN showed stable effects against additional noise studies. The high number of studies contributing to the ALE clusters and an FSN below the upper boundary (M\u2009=\u2009230) also indicates that the results are not driven by a few very dominant studies . Thus, a sufficient robustness to publication bias can be assumed. Third, regarding the performed functional characterization and connectivity-analysis of our results it must be considered that these results only refer to the data provided in the BrainMap database. GM changes in the identified regions are not necessarily associated with impairments in these behavioral domains and brain networks; they might also lead to improvements in the sense of a compensation mechanism. Fourth, this meta-analysis cannot answer the question whether the regions of reduced GM are a consequence of alcohol consumption or whether this GM reduction is a predisposing factor for the development of AUD. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings suggest that chronic high alcohol consumption is associated with reductions in GM volume in specific brain regions. The behavioral characterization of these brain regions suggests that impairments may occur in cognitive, attentional, emotional and perceptive functions. These regions also represent nodes in behavior-relevant networks such as the salience-, frontocerebellar-, central-executive, fronto-parietal- and default-mode networks. Earlier studies have already investigated specific dysfunctions and networks, but very few studies have investigated the interaction of multiple networks in AUD. Therefore, it would be a valuable approach for future functional studies to examine the networks identified here more closely and to consider their interaction. In addition, previously unnoticed functions such as music production and comprehension as well as somesthetic functions in patients with AUD should be further explored. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7933165,"text_md5":"945dd2ad7a2e05b89807aa6a3762e09a","field_positions":{"authors":[0,142],"journal":[143,150],"publication_year":[152,156],"title":[167,279],"keywords":[293,313],"abstract":[326,1785],"body":[1794,40625]},"batch":2,"pmid":33664372,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-021-84804-7","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7933165","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7933165"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7933165\">7933165<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7933165  Meta-analysis of grey matter changes and their behavioral characterization in patients with alcohol use disorder"}

The DMN gained prominence in cognitive neuroscience through the seminal work of Raichle and colleagues, who coined the term \u201cdefault mode\u201d [ ], and that of Greicius et al. [ ], who established the presence of this network during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). The DMN has been shown to be reproducible [ \u2013 ] and has relatively low inter- and intra-subject variability [ \u2013 ] across different acquisition and analysis protocols [ ,  ]. Brain regions reliably identified as part of the DMN include the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)\/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the precuneus\/posterior cingulate cortex (PCu\/PCC), the angular gyrus, and regions of the medial and lateral temporal cortex [ , \u2013 ]. Among these regions, the MPFC and the posteromedial cortex (PMC), which includes the PCu and PCC, are often considered core components of the network, showing widespread patterns of connectivity and activity across a range of internally directed tasks\/processes [ , , ]. \n\nThe DMN has been associated with wide array of cognitive functions including self-referential mental activity [ , , ] (particularly self-monitoring and autobiographical thoughts [ ], stimulus-independent thought [ , , ], and predictive planning [ , ]). Available evidence suggests that different DMN regions may contribute preferentially to the varied functions attributed to the DMN. Notably, the MPFC has been linked to the processing of visceromotor reactions elicited by self-referential information [ , ], while the PMC has been implicated in the monitoring of the external and internal environment and in self-related mental representations during spontaneous cognition [ , , ]. \n\nAlthough DMN dysfunction has emerged as a consistent biological correlate of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders [ , \u2013 ], the focus of this paper is on the role of the DMN in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, better understanding of the intra-network functional connectivity (i.e., cohesiveness) of the DMN may shed light on the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and reveal targets for improving brain network synchrony with therapeutic potential. A number of key studies have recently synthesized the available evidence on DMN cohesiveness in the major psychiatric disorders. A review of the relevant literature in schizophrenia not only highlighted significant interstudy variation, but also identified increased functional connectivity between the ventral MPFC and other DMN regions as the most common finding [ ]; these results were considered relevant to the self-referential nature of psychotic symptoms and the poor insight that are common features of this disorder [ ]. In major depressive disorder (MDD), a meta-analysis of 25 studies provided evidence of increased functional connectivity between the MPFC and medial temporal DMN regions centered on the hippocampus, which is thought to underpin affective self-referential cognitions that are typical of MDD [ ]. This regional pattern of hyperconnectivity may be nested within a more widespread reduction in DMN cohesiveness as indicated by a large-scale study involving rsfMRI data from 1,300 depressed patients and 1,128 healthy individuals [ ]. In obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), meta-analysis of 18 studies identified the ventral MPFC and the ACC as the two DMN regions with abnormal functional connectivity with the rest of the network regions [ ]; this pattern of dysconnectivity has been linked to patients\u2019 difficulties in switching away from self-generated obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a meta-analysis of 14 studies showed decreased connectivity within the DMN of the PCC, posterior hippocampus, and ventral MPFC [ ], which could be associated with patients\u2019 preoccupation with autobiographical information. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of 20 studies on patients with anxiety disorders [ ] and a review of 23 studies in bipolar disorder (BD) [ ] did not produce evidence for alternations in the intra-network functional connectivity of the DMN. Finally, a meta-analysis of 242 rsfMRI studies covering schizophrenia, MDD, BD, OCD, PTSD, anxiety disorders, and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders identified hypoconnectivity of the MPFC as a common transdiagnostic feature of intra-network DMN dysconnectivity [ ]. \n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the intra-network connectivity of the DMN specifically in adults diagnosed with schizophrenia, mood or anxiety disorders. The focus on schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders was predicated on their overlapping clinical features, frequent serial or concurrent comorbidity [ ], and highly correlated profiles of task-related abnormalities in brain functional activation [ , ]. Accordingly, we capitalized on powerful meta-analytic tools provided by activation likelihood estimation (ALE) [ \u2013 ] to analyze data from whole-brain resting-state connectivity studies published during the last 15 years that examined the functional cohesiveness of the DMN in these disorders. Based on the available evidence, our working hypotheses were that (a) alterations in DMN cohesiveness in adults across the major psychiatric disorders would implicate the major hubs of the network centered in the anteriomedial cortex and PMC and (b) our analyses would uncover novel information about disease-specific dysconnectivity in the regional pattern of the DMN. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Literature search and article eligibility \n  \nWe applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses criteria ( ) (Figure S1) to identify rsfMRI whole-brain studies published between January 1, 2005 and January 31, 2019 that reported significant differences in DMN intra-network connectivity between healthy adults and adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, MDD, BD, anxiety disorders, OCD, or PTSD (in the range 18\u201365 years old). In addition, we required that (a) in each study the spatial composition of the DMN was defined according to Raichle et al. [ ] and Buckner et al. [ ]; (b) the DMN was extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) or by using a DMN region as a seed; (c) the temporal correlations between the time-series of distinct DMN brain regions were computed in a time-locked fashion over the entire resting-state scan thus yielding static, nonshifted functional connectivity measures; and (d) studies used a whole-brain analysis approach. Studies using other functional measures such as dynamic functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, graph-theory, or effective connectivity were not included (further details on search strategy and article eligibility in eMethods). \n\n\n### Coding and database construction \n  \nFrom each selected study, we extracted coordinates of significant case\u2013control differences in the functional connectivity among DMN regions as we were interested in DMN functional cohesiveness. When necessary, the coordinates of the primary studies were converted from the Montreal Neurological Institute space to Talairach space using the icbm_other2tal transformation. These coordinates were coded by clinical diagnosis and by the direction of change; hyperconnectivity was defined as increased positive functional connectivity in the patient group relative to the healthy control group, and hypoconnectivity was defined as decreased positive functional connectivity in the patient group relative to the healthy control group. Additionally, coordinates of case\u2013control differences were coded according to the strength of the magnetic field of the scanner, the analytical method used to compute interregional correlations (ICA or seed-based analyses), and according to whether participants were instructed to keep their eyes open or closed during data acquisition. Separately for patient and control groups, we coded sample size, age, and sex (percentage male). In patients only, (a) medication status in each study was coded as the percentage of patients\u2019 sample receiving any psychotropic medication and (b) ratings of psychopathology from the different clinical instruments used in the primary studies were coded as \u201cminimal,\u201d \u201cmild,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d to enable analyses across clinical populations. Further details of the database construction are provided in the Supplementary eMethods. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nWe used ALE [ \u2013 ] implemented in MATLAB, to test whether the whole-brain coordinates of case\u2013control differences across studies converged into discrete clusters with a nonrandom spatial distribution. Per best practice standards [ \u2013 ], clusters of aberrant connectivity were identified using a cluster-level familywise-error-corrected threshold of   p  \u00a0< 0.05 (cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level   p  \u00a0< 0.001). Subsequently, for each cluster of significant DMN dysconnectivity, we extracted the per-voxel probability of case\u2013control differences from the modeled functional connectivity maps. We then calculated the contribution of age, sex, symptomatic severity, acquisition (eyes closed\/open), analyses parameters (ICA\/seed-based), and location of the seed (Pcu\/PCC, ACC\/MPFC, lateral parietal gyrus, lateral temporal gyrus, and medial temporal cortex) using nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests and Spearman correlations as appropriate. \n\nTo identify clusters of transdiagnostic changes, we performed an ALE analysis on the pooled coordinates of aberrant DMN intra-network connectivity, regardless of the direction of change, across all diagnoses. This global analysis on transdiagnostic aberrant brain connectivity has the advantage that it provides an optimal summary of neuroimaging findings across all disorders [ ]. Additional diagnosis-specific analyses were conducted (a) using the coordinates of case\u2013control differences in DMN connectivity from studies that included only unmedicated patients and (b) using the coordinates of case\u2013control differences in DMN hypo- and hyperconnectivity in each diagnostic category separately. \n\n\n### Ancillary analyses \n  \nIn order to ensure that the disorder contribution to the transdiagnostic clusters was not driven by the overrepresentation of MDD and schizophrenia in literature (see   and Table S1), we further applied a normalization procedure to the % contribution extracted for the disorders. Specifically, a normalization score was calculated for each disorder by dividing the % contribution of the disorder to the transdiagnostic cluster with the percentage of included studies related to this disorder. Values higher than 1 indicate an overrepresentation of this disorder.   \nSamples included in the database. \n    \nValues age, percentage (%) of male, and percentage (%) of medicated are shown as mean (standard deviation); age in years. \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Studies and coordinates \n  \nIn total, 70 articles were selected, comprising observations from 2,789 patients and 3,002 healthy individuals ( ). Full citations and details of the selected articles are provided in Table S1. There were no case\u2013control differences in age (  p  \u00a0= 0.05) or sex (  p  \u00a0= 0.65). However, there was a significant effect of diagnosis (  \u03c7  \u00a0= 17.8;   p  \u00a0= 1.4 \u00d7 10 ). Diagnosis-specific ALE analyses were only performed for schizophrenia (number of studies: 31) and MDD (number of studies: 22); the data for all other disorders were insufficient as the minimum number of studies for robust results is currently considered to be 17 [ ]. \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \n#### DMN regions showing aberrant connectivity across all diagnoses \n  \nCoordinates of aberrant connectivity within the DMN clustered in the left perigenual medial prefrontal cortex (pgMPFC) (peak coordinates:   x  \u00a0= \u22122,   y  \u00a0= 56, and   z  \u00a0= \u22122; 295 voxels) and in the PCu (peak coordinates:   x  \u00a0= 0,   y  \u00a0= \u221258,   z  \u00a0= 32; 254 voxels) ( ). Coordinates from studies on schizophrenia contributed the most in both regions (pgMPFC: 42%, PCu: 42%), followed by MDD (pgMPFC: 20%, PCu: 34%). The other disorders showed limited contribution to either cluster (<20%). The contribution of coordinates reflecting hypo- or hyper-connectivity was relatively similar for each cluster (pgMPFC: 53 vs. 47%, PCu: 67 vs. 33%). No significant effects were found for the moderator variables examined: age, sex, symptom severity, acquisition, and analyses parameters (all uncorrected   p  \u00a0> 0.05).   \nTransdiagnostic clusters of aberrant connectivity in the default mode network. Abbreviations: ANX, social anxiety disorder; BD, bipolar disorder; MDD, major depressive disorder; OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder; Pcu, precuneus; pgMPFC, perigenual medial prefrontal cortex; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia. \n  \n\nImportantly, the relative high contribution of schizophrenia and MDD to these two clusters was not related to the overrepresentation of the studies on MDD and schizophrenia included in the analyses. The normalization scores of the % contribution for both disorders and clusters ranged between 0.65 and 1.05. \n\nWhen we restricted the ALE analysis to coordinates from studies from patients who were unmedicated at the time of the scanning (schizophrenia:   n  \u00a0= 7; MDD:   n  \u00a0= 15; BD:   n  \u00a0= 3; OCD:   n  \u00a0= 3; PTSD:   n  \u00a0= 4; social anxiety disorder:   n  \u00a0= 1), we identified three clusters located in the pgMPFC (  x  \u00a0= 0,   y  \u00a0= 60,   z  \u00a0= \u22124,   k  \u00a0= 182 voxels), the dmPFC (  x  \u00a0= \u221212,   y  \u00a0= 54, 28,   k  \u00a0= 122 voxels), and the angular gyrus (  x  \u00a0= 42,   y  \u00a0= \u221264,   z  \u00a0= 44,   k  \u00a0= 93 voxels) (Figure S2). The pgMPFC cluster included mostly contribution from PTSD (47%), followed by schizophrenia (31%) that mostly reflected hypoconnectivity (63%). The dmPFC cluster included mainly contributions from MDD (47%) followed by schizophrenia (30%) reflecting hyperconnectivity (99.6%). The cluster in the right angular gyrus included mainly contributions from studies on MDD (77%) with equal contribution of hypo- and hyperconnectivity (55 vs. 45%). No significant moderator effects were found for age, sex, symptom severity, acquisition, and analyses parameters (all uncorrected   p  \u00a0> 0.05). \n\n\n#### DMN regions showing aberrant connectivity in schizophrenia \n  \nResults emerging from the schizophrenia group alone reinforced the role of PCu in schizophrenia where hypoconnectivity was further confirmed in a cluster which overlapped with the corresponding cluster in the transdiagnostic analysis   (  peak coordinates:   x  \u00a0= \u22122,   y  \u00a0= \u221256,   z  \u00a0= 32; 79 voxels) ( ). No significant moderator effects were found for age, sex, symptom severity, acquisition, and analyses parameters (all uncorrected   p  \u00a0> 0.05).   \nDisease-specific clusters of aberrant connectivity in the default mode network. Abbreviations: MDD, major depressive disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia. \n  \n\n\n#### DMN regions showing aberrant connectivity in MDD \n  \nWithin the MDD group, an additional cluster of hyperconnectivity emerged in the left dmPFC (peak coordinates:   x  \u00a0= \u22128,   y  \u00a0= 56,   z  \u00a0= 30; 99 voxels) ( ). No significant moderator effects were found for age, sex, symptom severity, acquisition, and analyses parameters (all uncorrected   p  \u00a0> 0.05). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe conducted a large-scale meta-analysis on the intra-network DMN functional connectivity comprising data from 70 rsfMRI studies derived from 2,789 patients with schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders and 3,002 healthy controls. We specifically focused on the DMN because this network has been shown to be the most reliable network among the major resting-state networks [ \u2013 ]. Case\u2013control difference in this network functional connectivity may be therefore less sensitive to the high variability in acquisition and analysis protocols across studies [ ]. In accordance with our hypothesis, the results implicated the major hubs of the DMN located in the anteromedial cortex and PMC and suggest that abnormalities in self-referential mental activity are common across these major psychiatric disorders. The posteromedial cluster corresponded to the PCu and showed evidence of dysconnectivity within the DMN across all diagnoses, as well as specific hypoconnectivity for schizophrenia. The pattern observed in the anteromedial cortex was more complex; the pgMPFC appeared to show abnormal intra-network connectivity across diagnoses while the dmPFC showed hyperconnectivity which was specific to MDD. The results of this study highlight the importance of the anteromedial cortex and of the PMC, for psychiatric disorders, and reinforce their known function as hub regions of the DMN [ , , , , ] and the brain more generally [ \u2013 ]. \n\nIt is well known that MPFC is functionally diverse [ \u2013 ]. In describing the MPFC subregions implicated here, we follow the functional parcellation proposed by de la Vega and colleagues [ ], which largely overlaps with the multimodal parcellation put forward by Glasser et al. [ ]. De la Vega et al. [ ] mapped mental operations to MPFC subregions following functional parcellation based on patterns of connectivity derived from a meta-analysis of approximately 10,000 studies available in the Neurosynth neuroimaging database. Their findings confirmed prior reports linking the anterior MPFC to affective and social processes and value-based decision-making, but the degree of engagement by these processes differed in MPFC subregions. Social cognition (comprising social perception, self-referential thought, and mentalizing) was maximally associated with the dmPFC, followed by the pgMPFC and then the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. \n\nThe PMC has been associated with multiple mental processes [ , , ]. In addressing the question of the relative functional specificity of the PCu, we draw on the work of Bzdok et al. [ ] who capitalized on the large functional imaging database provided by the BrainMap platform to define functional profile of the PCu. They found that the PCu, as well as most PMC regions, was significantly associated with mental operations relating to social cognition, theory of mind, and episodic memory (including autobiographic memory). Notably, mental operations relating to cognitive control, including attentional engagement, inhibition, reasoning, and orienting responses, were distinctly associated with the PCu [ ]. This finding confirms prior observations that attenuation of PCu activity during the transition from rest to task enables the engagement of sustained mechanism related to attention and working memory that are required for successful task performance [ ]. \n\nThe dysconnectivity profiles identified are likely to influence the functional integration of the PCu and MPFC subregions with networks outside the DMN as predicted by their high level of functional and anatomical connectivity across the brain [ , , ]. In the context, DMN cohesiveness, the preferential functional profiles of the regions identified in the current meta-analysis points to disrupted integration between affective processing\/value-based decision making, social cognition, and cognitive control. The differential regional dysconnectivity observed goes a long way toward reconciling conflicting results from prior studies particularly those on schizophrenia [ ] and MDD [ , ], which also contributed the majority of the data analyzed here. Of note, the analyses conducted separately in each disorder also highlighted the importance of the dmPFC hyperconnectivity for MDD. This region is considered a nexus of clinical significance for patients with MDD [ ], especially those with elevated levels of rumination [ ]. Relatedly, increased dMPFC connectivity with other prefrontal regions has been shown to be associated with higher levels of negative self-referential cognition [ ] while increased dMPFC connectivity with the PCC post-electroconvulsive therapy may be conducive to improved clinical response [ ]. \n\nAbnormalities in affect [ ], valuation [ ], self-referential [ , ], and social cognition [ \u2013 ] and cognitive control [ , ] represent domain-general dimensions that have been consistently implicated in all the disorders considered here. We acknowledge that psychiatric disorders also show marked variations in their clinical presentation both between diagnoses and between individuals with the same diagnosis. The current results suggest that mapping DMN regional dysconnectivity is also domain-general and likely to underpin variable within-domain deficits in different individuals and diagnoses. This issue should be explored further in large single samples studies where both clinical, cognitive and connectivity measures can be examined simultaneously. \n\nThis study has several strengths and limitations. The number of articles selected in this meta-analysis was lower than that in prior meta-analyses on individual disorders [ \u2013 ] because we considered only rsfMRI studies in adults and among those only studies focusing on the intra-network cohesiveness of the DMN. The restriction on adult individuals was predicated by age-related impact on functional connectivity that could have biased results [ , ]. We included studies that used both ICA and seed-based analyses to compute connectivity and found that the results were robust to this methodological variation. The concern with using seed-based analyses only is that the interstudy variability in the exact localization of the seed may influence the pattern of connectivity; however, there is evidence that this is not the case [ ]. The number of studies in BD, PTSD, OCD, and anxiety disorders describing significant case\u2013control differences in the DMN was very small, and hence we were unable to undertake diagnosis-specific analyses for these disorders. This is a general limitation of the ALE method, which does not account for negative results. Furthermore, the use of different acquisition protocols and statistical thresholds in the included studies could influence measurement reliability [ ]. In this regard, any meta-analysis is prone to publication bias, as we cannot control for statistical methodologies used in the original studies for thresholding the results. However, this is an issue that is out of the scope of this study. Further effort to optimize analytic strategies for reliability should be done across clinical studies [ ]. Nevertheless, we found that the transdiagnostic results were not influenced by the larger number of studies in schizophrenia and MDD and were in line with previous transdiagnostic studies [ , ]. The cross-sectional nature of the studies included does not allow us to comment on the evolution of these patterns of connectivity and their association with disease stage. We addressed the issue of medication by undertaking a sub-analysis on coordinates derived from studies with unmedicated patients. The majority of these studies involved patients with MDD, and the results obtained appear more pertinent to this disorder. Our findings suggest that medication may have an effect on DMN connectivity that may be most consistently observed in the angular gyrus which is in line with previous reports on the \u201cnormalizing\u201d effect of antidepressant medication on hyperconnectivity of this region [ ]. It is also in line with the study by Schilbach et al. [ ] that described that medicated patients with MDD and SCZ showed hypoconnectivity in the lateral parietal cortex of the DMN. \n\nOverall, this meta-analysis identified regional changes in DMN cohesiveness in the anterior and posterior hubs of the DMN as shared and specific brain phenotypes of psychiatric disorders. These brain phenotypes have the potential to serve as targets for interventions aiming to improve the functional integration of the DMN across diverse psychiatric populations. The clusters found in this meta-analysis are freely available (see Supplementary Material) and can then be used as a priori regions of interest for future studies. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7355168,"text_md5":"ac777166cae0ea68ac7233cb528bcd08","field_positions":{"authors":[0,129],"journal":[130,144],"publication_year":[146,150],"title":[161,330],"keywords":[344,428],"abstract":[441,1793],"body":[1802,25954]},"batch":2,"pmid":32466812,"doi":"10.1192\/j.eurpsy.2020.57","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7355168","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7355168"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7355168\">7355168<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7355168  Transdiagnostic and disease-specific abnormalities in the default-mode network hubs in psychiatric disorders: A meta-analysis of resting-state functional imaging studies"}

Here, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of functional-MRI studies intranasally administering OT (IN-OT) to uncover neural substrates underlying the IN-OT effects and to elucidate differential IN-OT effects between healthy and clinical populations. Meta-analyses were conducted on 66 IN-OT fMRI studies, stratified by psychopathology, valence and sex. IN-OT increased bilateral amygdala, caudate head, and superior temporal activity in healthy individuals and increased dorsal anterior cingulate activity in patients. Moreover, IN-OT decreased amygdala activity in both patients and healthy individuals but did so to a greater degree in patients than healthy individuals. The OT-increased amygdala activity was only found on the negative social and affective processes, whereas the OT-decreased amygdala activity was mainly contributed by contrasts on negative-valenced processes. IN-OT increased parahippocampal activity and decreased amygdala activity during negative socio-affective processing. During positive socio-affective processes, IN-OT increased caudate head activity. This study indicates convergent neural substrates and the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms for IN-OT effects on social and affective processes. The common and different effects of IN-OT on patients and healthy individuals and the modulation of OT effects by valence have critical implications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), an evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide and neuromodulator, is an important molecular substrate for social adaptation due to its effects on social and emotional functioning. Moreover, OT is emerging as a pharmacological target for the treatment of mental disorders characterized by social or emotional deficits ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Previous studies have shown consistent effects of OT on various social and emotional processes (such as emotion recognition and in-group cooperation), as well as controversial OT effects on some other processes (e.g. minding-reading and trust). Discrepant effects of intranasal administration of OT (IN-OT) have been reported in some social cognitive and affective processes. For example, whereas several studies have shown that IN-OT increases trust ( ;  ;  ;  ), other studies have shown that IN-OT does not influence or even decreases trust ( ;  ;  ). The discrepant or even opposing effects of IN-OT have been proposed to result from contextual factors and personal characteristics ( ;  ), such as the cooperative-competitive context and personality traits. However, convergent IN-OT effects on some social and affective processes have been observed in previous empirical studies and confirmed by several meta-analyses. IN-OT has been reliably shown to improve facial emotional recognition (e.g.  ;  ;  ) and to promote in-group cooperation (e.g.  ,  ;  ;  ). Moreover, several recent meta-analyses on the behavioral effects of IN-OT have confirmed convergent effects of IN-OT on facial emotional recognition, in-group cooperation, and stress responses ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe effects of OT are due to its role as a neuromodulator in the brain ( ;  ); hence, numerous functional MRI studies have examined the effects of IN-OT on social cognitive and affective processes. However, the issues regarding the discrepant effects of IN-OT, the modulations of OT effects by personal milieu and context, and the potential differences in OT effects between healthy and patient groups have challenged the enthusiasm toward the translational potentials of OT ( ;  ). The current meta-analysis first applied the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique for quantitative coordinate-based meta-analyses of pharmacological neuroimaging studies that have compared IN-OT   vs   placebo (PL) to reveal convergent neural substrates underlying the effects of IN-OT. IN-OT has been shown to either increase or decrease brain responses during social and affective processing ( ;  ). Therefore, a meta-analytic perspective on IN-OT fMRI findings is critically needed in the field to determine whether there are convergent neural substrates underlying the IN-OT effects. There have been two meta-analyses of OT fMRI studies ( ;  ), both including only 11 OT fMRI studies (published before February 2013). The limited number of OT fMRI studies at that time constrained the analyses and findings. Due to the multifaceted positive effects of IN-OT and its potential in clinical trials, a rapidly increasing number of pharmaco-fMRI studies have examined the effects of IN-OT since 2013. The current meta-analysis of 66 pharmaco-fMRI studies (published before March 2017) sought to reveal convergent activity mediating IN-OT effects on social and affective processes. \n\nSecond, we sought to elucidate unspecified neuropsychological mechanisms underlying IN-OT effect. Different mechanisms have been proposed ( ;  ) to explain the OT effects. Recently, in the social adaptation model, OT has been proposed to promote social functioning through different neuropsychological mechanisms, including reduction of negative affect, promotion of rewarding experiences from positive social interaction, and heightened social salience ( ). Thus, we applied separate ALE meta-analyses to examine the IN-OT effects on positive and negative social and affective processing, serving as a quantitative examination of these mechanisms. \n\nThird, we sought to examine the IN-OT effects on clinical and healthy populations separately. Most previous OT fMRI studies have examined neural substrates mediating OT effects in the healthy population. The effects of IN-OT have been shown to be modulated by cognitive style ( ), attachment style ( ), personality traits ( ;  ;  ), social support ( ), and early life experiences ( ;  ). These factors may differ between clinical and healthy populations ( ). Therefore, a key issue for OT translation is to reveal the common and differential IN-OT effects between patients and healthy volunteers ( ). Therefore, separate meta-analyses were conducted on studies involving patients and healthy volunteers to reveal common and different effects of IN-OT. \n\nFinally, we explored factors moderating the IN-OT effects on brain activity, such as the valence of social interactions\/processes and sex. Some previous studies have shown sex differences in the IN-OT effects on brain activity. For example, IN-OT has been found to decrease amygdala activity in response to emotional faces in males ( ) but to increase amygdala activation in females ( ).  ) have directly compared the IN-OT effects in males and females within the same paradigm and have found that IN-OT increases activity in the striatum, insula, amygdala, and hippocampus in males but has no effect in females. However, some other studies have not detected sex-dependent IN-OT effects, including recognition of facial expression ( ), desire for social engagement ( ) and envy ( ). We thus used meta-analytic technique to uncover whether convergent common and\/or differential IN-OT effects existed between males and females. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nStudies examining IN-OT effects on the human brain published before March 2017, were selected through a standard search in PubMed, Embase and ScienceDirect, with keywords [\u2018oxytocin\u2019] AND [\u2018fMRI\u2019 OR \u2018magnetic resonance imaging\u2019]. Additional studies were collected by reviewing the reference lists of relevant papers in the first step and the reference lists of several review articles. The first-level literature search yielded 414 publications, 66 of which met inclusion criteria (  for Flow Diagram of the Literature Search;   for details of all eligible studies). All eligible articles were individually screened for the presence of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space and OT effects. All coordinates were entered by authors Y. Ma and D. Wang and double-checked by X. Yan.\n \n  \nFlow diagram of the literature search. \n  \nAll relevant studies (414 included) were screened for the following inclusion\/exclusion criteria: (1) we included papers reporting empirical studies with humans (188 studies were included) and excluded review articles, meta-analyses, commentaries, conferences and animal studies (226 studies were excluded); (2) we included papers written in English (184 studies were included) and excluded studies not written in English (4 studies were excluded); (3) we included papers using functional MRI (120 studies were included) and excluded papers using Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) or structural analysis only (64 were excluded); (4) we included studies involving IN-OT (83 studies were included) and excluded studies that did not use a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure or involved only plasma OT or the OT receptor gene (37 studies were excluded); (5) we included studies examining the contrast \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 or \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 (79 studies were included) and excluded studies that did not mention the direction of IN-OT effects or did not report coordinates (4 studies were excluded); (6) we included studies presenting the results of the whole-brain analysis (75 studies were included) and excluded studies reporting only region of interest (ROI) analysis (4 studies were excluded); (7) we included studies with specific tasks (67 studies were included) and excluded studies only examining the OT effect on resting connectivity without any task (8 were excluded). In addition, we focused on the effects of IN-OT on brain activity related to social and affective responses, given that previous human OT studies have primarily examined the IN-OT effects in social cognition and affective responses (66 studies were included) and have excluded studies using non-social tasks (1 study was excluded). Social processes, as defined in social cognitive neuroscience ( ;  ;  ), refer to the processes related to oneself and other people and the processes that occur at the interface of the self and others. Thus, the IN-OT effects on social cognition included studies examining the IN-OT effects on processes of oneself, others and social interactions, such as mind-reading, friend or foe judgment, theory of mind, eye gaze, interpersonal trust, and cooperation. To investigate the effects of IN-OT on affective processes, similarly to our previous study ( ), we included studies examining the IN-OT effects on the implicit or explicit experience of positive\/negative affect. Specifically, positive affect was induced by passive viewing or active responses to happy faces, cooperation, pleasant\/positive pictures, faces of partner\/children, erotic\/rewarding pictures or infant laughter. Negative affect was induced by passive viewing or active judgments on fearful, angry, sad, painful or disgusted faces, defection, unpleasant\/negative pictures, punishment, stress or infant cry. \n\n\n### ALE analysis \n  \nMeta-analyses of eligible studies were based on the ALE method ( ) and used the revised ALE algorithm ( ) in GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ). GingerALE is a quantitative coordinate-based meta-analysis method used to identify voxel-wise spatial convergence of activation coordinates across published studies. Given the within-experiment coherence of coordinates, multiple contrasts from the same population were nested to prevent magnification of the impact of a specific study ( ). GingerALE switched ALE methods from fixed effects to random effects, incorporated variable uncertainty on the basis of the sample size of each study ( ), and added thresholding methods ( ). GingerALE automatically computed the ALE values for every voxel in the brain by using an automatically determined full-width half-maximum (FWHM) value ( ), which is calculated by the number of subjects in each experiment. The size of the FWHM of the Gaussian kernel was adjusted for the expected between-subject and between-template variability to model spatial uncertainty ( ;  ). \n\nThe procedure involved modeling of all reported coordinates of the selected contrasts as the peaks of 3D Gaussian probability distributions (coordinates originally reported in MNI were converted to Talairach space;  ;  ), and all coordinates reported in this study were in the Talairach space). The 3D Gaussian distributions were summed to produce a statistical map that estimated the likelihood of activation for each voxel as determined by all studies in the analysis. For the correction of multiple comparisons, we applied stringent threshold algorithms of family-wise error rate (FWE)   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 (1000 permutations, cluster size\u2009>\u200915mm ) to reveal the robust IN-OT effects ( ). \n\nGingerALE also allowed for statistical comparisons between two ALE maps. The subtraction and conjunction analyses uncovered statistically significant differences and similarities in OT effects between healthy volunteers and patients; and between studies recruited male and female participants. Given that GingerALE has not developed the threshold algorithm of FWE for statistical comparisons, a threshold of FDR pN\u2009<\u20090.01 (1000 permutations), cluster size\u2009>\u2009100\u2009mm  was applied to the subtraction and conjunction analyses. \n\n\n### Data analysis plan \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis focused on IN-OT induced brain activity changes. Neural effects of IN-OT were identified in contrasts between: OT and PL sessions in within-subject studies; and OT and PL groups in between-subjects studies. The contrasts of \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 and \u2018PL\u2009>\u2009OT\u2019 separately identified neural activity increased or decreased by IN-OT. Sixty-six IN-OT-fMRI studies (including 99 contrasts, involving 3286 subjects) were included in the current meta-analyses. Sixty studies (78 contrasts, 2677 healthy participants) examined neural effects of IN-OT in healthy population. Sixteen studies (21 contrasts, 370 patients   vs   239 healthy controls) examined neural effects of IN-OT in clinical population, including patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, 8 studies, 160 patients), social anxiety disorder (SAD, 3 studies, 52 patients), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 3 studies, 109 patients), major depressive disorder (1 study, 8 patients), and borderline personality disorder (1 study, 41 patients). \n\nFirst, we summarized IN-OT-fMRI studies to show the convergent general effects of IN-OT on brain activity. Thus ALE meta-analysis on all eligible studies, collapsing across subject groups (patients and healthy volunteers; males and females) and processing valence, was conducted to reveal brain regions generally affected by IN-OT during social interaction and affective processes. More specifically, separate ALE analyses were conducted on all the \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 and \u2018PL\u2009>\u2009OT\u2019 contrasts to uncover general brain activity increased or decreased by IN-OT. It should be noticed that only positive coordinates were extracted from the OT minus PL contrasts and entered the meta-analysis of \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 condition, vice versa. Second, we examined the common and different neural effects of IN-OT in healthy and clinical populations. Separate ALE meta-analyses were conducted on studies involving patients and healthy volunteers to uncover the OT-induced increases (\u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts) and decreases (\u2018PL\u2009>\u2009OT\u2019 contrasts) in patients and healthy volunteers. Third, we further examined statistically significant difference and similarity in IN-OT effects between healthy volunteers and patients by conducting the conjunction and subtraction analyses on the two sets of activation coordinates showing IN-OT effects in patients and healthy volunteers. Forth, we aimed to elucidate the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying the effects of IN-OT by performing separate ALE meta-analyses on OT-fMRI studies stratified by the treatment directionality (OT-induced increase\/decrease) and processing valence (positive\/negative). Finally, we aimed to uncover whether the neural effects of IN-OT were modulated by sex by conducting conjunction and subtraction analyses on two sets of activation coordinates from studies recruiting males and females. Given the limited number of pharmaco-fMRI OT studies on patients, the valence analysis and sex-modulation were only performed on healthy volunteers. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### General OT-induced brain activity changes \n  \nALE meta-analysis was first conducted on all the reported activation in the eligible studies to uncover the general effect of IN-OT on brain activity. Analysis of 56 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts (368 activation coordinates reported in the eligible studies) revealed convergent OT-induced activity increases in the bilateral amygdala and left caudate (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05;  ). IN-OT decreased activity in bilateral amygdala (extending to globus pallidus, GP; FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; 43 \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts; 260 activation coordinates;  ).\n \n  \nGeneral neural effects of intranasal administration of oxytocin. (A) IN-OT increased activity in the left (lAmy) and right amygdala (rAmy) and left caudate (lCaud) whereas (B) decreased activity in bilateral amygdala (threshold: FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05, 1000 permutations,   k  \u2009>\u200915\u2009mm ). \n  \n\n### OT effects on healthy and clinical populations \n  \nWe next conducted separate ALE analyses to reveal IN-OT induced brain activity changes in healthy volunteers and patients. Seventy-seven contrasts examined the effects of IN-OT on brain activity in healthy volunteers. ALE analysis on healthy volunteers revealed that IN-OT increased neural activity in bilateral amygdala, left caudate, and superior temporal gyrus (STG) (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; 41 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 250 activation coordinates;  ) and decreased neural activity in right amygdala (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; 36 \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 228 activation coordinates;  ). Twenty-one contrasts examined the effects of IN-OT in clinical population. ALE analysis from FWE correction revealed that IN-OT increased neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; 14 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 114 activation coordinates;  ) and decreased the left amygdala activity (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; 7 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 33 activation coordinates;  ).\n   \nThe effects of IN-OT on brain activity in healthy volunteers and patients (threshold: FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05, 1000 permutations,   k  \u2009>\u200915\u2009mm ) \n    \n\n\n### Comparison between patients and healthy volunteers \n  \nGiven that the majority of IN-OT fMRI studies examined neural substrates mediating OT effects in healthy population, a key issue for OT clinical translation was to reveal the common and differential OT effects between patients and healthy volunteers. Thus we directly compared the effects of IN-OT between healthy volunteers and patients. We noticed that most studies examining OT effects on patients were conducted in males. Thus for the inclusion of studies in healthy population, only studies examining OT effect on males were included in this section for comparison to control for potential sex influences. \n\nConjunction and subtraction analyses on the \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts revealed significantly IN-OT reduced bilateral amygdala activity (left: \u221219.8, \u22122.7, \u221215.7,   k  \u2009=\u2009816\u2009mm ; right: 18.9, \u22121, \u221213.6,   k  \u2009=\u2009208mm ) in both healthy volunteers and patients. Moreover, IN-OT decreased left amygdala (\u221224.3\/\u22127.2\/\u221212.5,   k  \u2009=\u2009544\u2009mm , FDR   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.01) activity to a greater degree in patients than healthy volunteers. However, conjunction and subtraction analyses on the \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts did not show significant similarities and differences in brain activity increased by IN-OT between patients and healthy volunteers. \n\n\n### OT effects on positive and negative social and affective processes \n  \nTo reveal the neuropsychological mechanisms through which IN-OT influences social and affective processes, we analyzed IN-OT effects on healthy volunteers stratified by the valence of social and affective process (this analysis was only performed on healthy volunteers given the limited number of IN-OT fMRI studies on patients). During negative social and affective processes, IN-OT increased parahippocampus activity (26.8\/1.2\/\u221213.1,   k  \u2009=\u200956\u2009mm , FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; based on 16 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 72 activation coordinates), whereas decreased right amygdala (18.1\/\u22125\/\u22128,   k  \u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm , FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; ALE analysis on 21 \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 136 activation coordinates). During the positive social and affective processes, we found that IN-OT increased activity in the caudate head (\u22127.2\/3.2\/2.8,   k  \u2009=\u200956\u2009mm , FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; ALE analysis on 17 \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 102 activation coordinates), whereas no brain activity decreased by IN-OT was significant (FWE   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.05; ALE analysis on 13 \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts, 48 activation coordinates). \n\n\n### OT effects in healthy males and females \n  \nConjunction and subtraction analyses on \u2018OT\u2009>\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts (male: 164 activation coordinates in 25 contrasts; female: 84 activation coordinates in 14 contrasts) were conducted to reveal significant similarities as well as differences in brain activity increased by IN-OT between healthy males and females (this analysis was also only performed on healthy volunteers given the limited number of IN-OT fMRI studies on patients). IN-OT increased right amygdala activity (23.7\/\u22121.7\/\u221211,   k  \u2009=\u2009128\u2009mm ) was overlapped in males and females. Conjunction and subtraction analyses on \u2018OT\u2009<\u2009PL\u2019 contrasts (male: 187 activation coordinates in 22 contrasts; female: 39 activation coordinates in 13 contrasts) showed that IN-OT decreased brain activity in the right amygdala (extending to medial GP; 17.3\/\u22124.2\/\u22129.1,   k  \u2009=\u2009656\u2009mm , FDR   P\u2009  <  \u2009  0.01) in both males and females. In addition, no brain activity increased or decreased by IN-OT was significantly different between males and females. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study has uncovered several important findings. First, we showed converging evidence that IN-OT increased neural activity in the social and emotional networks, including bilateral amygdala, caudate head and STG, and decreased neural responses in the bilateral amygdala. The discrepant effects of IN-OT on the amygdala activity (i.e. both IN-OT induced increases and decreases) were discussed in the following section. Second, we showed that IN-OT decreased amygdala activity in both patients and healthy volunteers, but to a greater degree in patients than healthy volunteers. Moreover, the activations of different brain regions were increased by IN-OT in healthy and clinical populations. IN-OT increased neural activity in bilateral amygdala, left caudate head and STG activity in healthy individuals but increased dACC activity in patients. Third, we showed that the effect of IN-OT in healthy volunteers was modulated by valence. IN-OT increased parahippocampus activity, whereas decreased amygdala activity during negative social and affective processes. During positive social and affective processes, IN-OT increased caudate head activity. Finally, we showed common IN-OT effects on amygdala activity in males and females, and no significant sex-difference in OT effect was found. These findings have critical implications, providing convergent neural substrates underlying IN-OT effect, revealing similar and different OT effects on healthy and clinical populations, suggesting neuropsychological mechanisms underlying OT effects on social and affective processes, and confirming modulation of OT effect by valence. \n\n### Understanding of the discrepant directionality (i.e. increase or decrease) of the general OT effects on amygdala \n  \nWe showed that, in the analysis of general OT effect, IN-OT resulted in both increases and decreases in bilateral amygdala activity. Such discrepant IN-OT effects on amygdala can be understood in further consideration of the modulation of the valence of social and affective processing. Specifically, we showed that the OT-decreased amygdala activity was only found in the meta-analytic analysis on the negative (but not positive) emotional and social processes. Moreover, we examined the studies contributing to the OT-induced amygdala activity change. We found that the OT-induced increases in the amygdala activity was mainly contributed by the contrasts examining IN-OT effects on positive social and affective processes ( ;  , ;  ), whereas the OT-decreased amygdala activity was mainly contributed by contrasts on negative-valenced processes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, analysis from a more liberal threshold of FDR correction revealed that IN-OT increased amygdala activity during positive social and affective processes but decreased the amygdala activation during negative-valenced processes (see  ). Amygdala has been recognized as the emotional hub ( ;  ;  ;  ), also plays a key role in social interaction ( ) and processing social relevant stimuli ( ). The amygdala activity increased or suppressed by IN-OT may have different functional meanings. The IN-OT increased amygdala activity may suggest that IN-OT enhanced social functioning and\/or increased positive experience from social processing. The decreased amygdala activity by IN-OT may reflect the anxiolytic action of OT, suggesting that OT reduced negative affect processing for both healthy ( ;  ) and clinical populations ( ;  ). Consistently our recent study suggested a cognitive mechanism of valence-specific IN-OT effects: the facilitation of learning from positive information and the reduction of learning from negative information ( ). Given the differential roles of sub-regions of amygdala during social and affective processing ( ), it is of interest and critical importance for future research to further test the precise OT effects on different sub-regions of amygdala. \n\n\n### Neural supports for the social adaptation model of OT function \n  \nIt has been proposed that OT promoted social adaptation through different neuropsychological mechanisms, such as reduction of negative affect, promotion of rewarding experiences from positive social interaction and facilitation of social salience ( ). The current meta-analysis lent systematic neural support for these mechanisms underlying OT effects. The findings that IN-OT decreased amygdala activity during negative social and affective processing lent support for the negative affect-reduction mechanism, as this was a key region related to social stress and negative affect ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Thus, OT promoted social functioning through decreasing affective reaction caused by negative social interaction. The social rewarding experiences promotion mechanism would predict that IN-OT increased brain activity in the emotion-reactive network (amygdala, ACC;  ;  ;  ) and reward-related network (caudate, midbrain;  ;  ;  ) during positive social and affective processes. Indeed, we showed that IN-OT convergently increased activity in the amygdala, caudate head and dACC. Moreover, IN-OT increased activation in the caudate head during positive social and affective processes, providing the neural basis for the social rewarding experiences promotion mechanism. The social salience mechanism would predict enhanced perceptual processing of social cues by IN-OT, independent of valence ( ;  ). We indeed found that IN-OT increased activity in the STG in healthy population, an important region involved in social cognitive processes ( ). In addition, the IN-OT effect on STG activity might be independent of the valence of the processes, as we found that IN-OT increased STG activity was contributed by studies examining positive ( ;  ) or negative processes ( ;  ;  ). Taken together, the OT effects on social functioning might be mediated by multiple neuropsychological mechanisms rather than underpinned by a uniform mechanism. These meta-analytic findings lend neural basis for our social adaptation model ( ), proposing that the multifaceted roles of OT in social and affective processes improve the capability for social adaptation. \n\n\n### Comprehensive understanding of IN-OT effects in healthy and clinical population \n  \nThe majority of OT-fMRI studies examined IN-OT effect in healthy population. Therefore, understanding the common and differential OT effects between healthy and clinical populations was critical for the clinical use of OT. The current meta-analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of OT effects in patients and healthy volunteers. First, convergent OT effects on the social and emotional networks were observed in both healthy and clinical populations. Specifically, IN-OT decreased bilateral amygdala activity in both patients and healthy volunteers, but IN-OT decreased left amygdala activity to a greater degree in patients than healthy volunteers. Moreover, IN-OT increased activity in different brain regions for patients and healthy volunteers. IN-OT increased activity in the amygdala, left caudate and STG for the healthy volunteers. However, OT-increased activity was found in the dACC for patients. These findings suggested selective IN-OT effects in patients and healthy volunteers. It should be noticed that currently only a limited number of OT-fMRI studies have examined IN-OT effect on brain function in patients, and the conjunction and subtraction analyses were performed on the two sets of imbalanced contrasts showing OT effects in patients and healthy volunteers. In addition, the more stringent threshold of FWE correction has not been developed for subtraction analysis in ALE analysis, the subtraction analysis was corrected by the FDR thresholding. Thus the OT effects on brain activity in patients and the comparison of OT effects between patients and healthy volunteers need to be further addressed by future research. \n\nThe next question was whether OT exhibited generic positive effects on various mental disorders ( ) or specific effects on different clinical groups ( ). To answer this question, we conducted separate ALE meta-analyses based on disorder types. Because OT-fMRI studies mainly examined OT effects on patients with ASD and SAD, we examined OT neural effects in ASD and SAD, respectively. ALE analysis on OT effects in ASD showed increased activity in the ACC and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) ( ) and decreased activity in the amygdala. ALE analysis on OT effects in SAD patients showed decreased left amygdala activity by OT ( ). These results supported the view of specific effects on different clinical groups, suggesting pro-social effect of OT for ASD and anxiolytic action of OT for SAD. Therefore, OT acts on different neuropsychological mechanisms in ASD and SAD, suggesting that therapeutic decisions regarding OT administration should be tailored to specific symptoms. However, it should be noted that this quantitative meta-analysis on the OT neural effect on ASD and SAD is based on a limited number of studies. Thus the conclusions should be interpreted cautiously and the OT effects on brain activity in clinical population need to be further confirmed with future research. \n\nMoreover, OT effects may be modulated by the stage of the disorder. For example, recent OT-fMRI studies have shown that opposite OT effects on amygdala activity to emotional faces in with recently trauma-exposed (within 1-week post-trauma) individuals and PTSD patients. IN-OT increased amygdala activity to fearful faces in recently trauma-exposed women ( ). However, OT reduced amygdala reactivity towards emotional faces in PTSD patients ( ). In addition, most of the published OT-fMRI studies and majority of clinical OT trials examine the effect of a single-dose OT administration. Only a limited number of clinical trials examined multiple-dose or chronic use of OT for mental disorders (see   for a summary). A recent OT-fMRI study ( ) has examined the clinical and neural effects of 6-week OT administration in ASD patients. While the authors showed that 6-week OT mitigated behavioral and neural responses in ASD, these effect sizes were not larger than a single administration of OT. Thus, more clinical trials, as well as OT-fMRI studies, are needed to examine behavioral changes and neural effects by chronic OT administration, and the therapeutic potential of chronic OT needs to be further proven. \n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that OT increases neural activity in multiple nodes of the social and emotional network, and decreases neural responses in the emotional network, providing convergent neural evidence for anxiolytic and pro-social effects of OT. The common, but graded, OT effects on patients versus healthy volunteers support therapeutic promise to translate basic OT effects into clinical use for social functioning deficits. Moreover, the modulation of OT effect by the valence of social processes suggests that OT achieves anxiolytic and pro-social ends through different neuropsychological mechanisms. Thus we provide neural evidence supporting therapeutic effect of OT and highlight modulatory factors that would affect the application of OT in clinical practice. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5647800,"text_md5":"ab79f864de437233bf1b157fc59cdb93","field_positions":{"authors":[0,56],"journal":[57,81],"publication_year":[83,87],"title":[98,208],"keywords":[222,277],"abstract":[290,1815],"body":[1824,33492]},"batch":2,"pmid":29048602,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsx085","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5647800","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5647800"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5647800\">5647800<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5647800  Neural substrates underlying the effects of oxytocin: a quantitative meta-analysis of pharmaco-imaging studies"}
{"text":"Quintana, Daniel S. and Outhred, Tim and Westlye, Lars T. and Malhi, Gin S. and Andreassen, Ole A.\nSyst Rev, 2016\n\n# Title\n\nThe impact of oxytocin administration on brain activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol\n\n# Keywords\n\nOxytocin\nBrain imaging\nSystematic review\nMeta-analysis\nProtocol\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nConverging evidence demonstrates the important role of the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) in human behaviour and cognition. Intranasal OT administration has been shown to improve several aspects of social communication, such as the theory of mind performance and gaze to the eye region, and reduce anxiety and related negative cognitive appraisals. While this early research has demonstrated the potential for intranasal OT to treat psychiatric illnesses characterized by social impairments, the neurobiological mechanisms are not well known. Researchers have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of OT response; however, results have been variable and moderating factors are poorly understood. The aim of this meta-analysis is to synthesize data examining the impact of intranasal OT administration on neural activity. \n\n\n## Methods\/design \n  \nStudies that report fMRI data after intranasal OT administration will be identified. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases will be searched as well as the citation lists of retrieved articles. Eligible articles written in English from 2005 onwards will be included in the meta-analysis, and corresponding authors of these papers will be invited to contribute   t  -maps. Data will be collected from eligible studies for synthesis using Seed-based   d   Mapping (SDM) or Multi-Level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA), depending on the number of usable   t  -maps received. Additionally, publication bias and risk of bias will be assessed. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis will be the first pre-registered synthesis of data to identify the neural correlates of OT nasal spray response. The identification of brain regions underlying OT\u2019s observed effects will help guide future research and better identify treatment targets. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \nPROSPERO  \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186\/s13643-016-0386-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has attracted significant scientific and lay interest for its role in social cognition and behaviour [ ,  ]. For example, a single administration of OT has been shown to modulate the perception of social cues [ ], motivate in-group cooperation [ ], increase gaze to the eye region of faces [ ], and reduce anxiety [ ,  ]. Due to these reported cognitive and behavioural effects, researchers have begun investigating OT\u2019s potential to treat psychiatric conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and social anxiety disorder in a number of clinical trials (for a review, see [ ]). \n\nAlthough the modulatory effects of OT on social behaviour and cognition have been demonstrated repeatedly [ ,  ], the mechanisms are poorly understood [ ,  ]. To better elucidate these behavioural and cognitive effects, researchers have investigated the neural correlates of OT\u2019s effects using brain-imaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Converging evidence from this field suggests the amygdala\u2014a key brain region involved in the processing of emotional [ ] and social stimuli [ ]\u2014is an important target of OT administration [ \u2013 ]. Although the amygdala has received significant research interest, other areas of the brain have also implicated in OT\u2019s response [ ]. \n\nInterest in the use of fMRI to understand the effects of OT has been increasing exponentially in the past decade (Fig.\u00a0 ), with a total of 115 publications using the keywords \u201coxytocin\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d published between 2004 and 2014 (although only a minority of these publications specifically assess the impact of OT administration on fMRI outcomes). Early work primarily investigated neural activity during emotional task processing after OT administration [ ,  ,  ]; however, recent research has begun to investigate resting state activity and connectivity [ ,  ]. Research is yet to synthesize studies that explore resting state neural activity, which is important for understanding neural modulation with OT regardless of task, particularly within the context of heterogeneity in task design. Meta-analysis provides a robust statistical method of synthesizing effect sizes across studies and is a valuable tool for clarifying past findings.   \nIncreasing interest in fMRI and oxytocin. PubMed metadata was collected on the number of articles containing the terms \u201cfMRI\u201d and \u201coxytocin\u201d published between 2004 and 2014. A loess smoothed fit curve was overlaid on data points to illustrate the year-to-year trend. Data was collected using the \u201cRISmed\u201d R package \n  \n\nVarious methods are available for the meta-analysis of brain-imaging data [ ]. Prior research synthesizing OT fMRI data has adopted a meta-analytic approach using effect size signed differential mapping [ ]. This approach uses extracted fMRI peak coordinates to create an   estimated   map of all possible brain region coordinates, which are then synthesized. However, this approach can bias effects of interest estimates where individual studies have reported a relatively high number of peaks when compared to others by chance. Additionally, it is difficult to analyse and interpret the impact of key study design characteristics such as dose and sex using this approach, unless a large number of studies are available. The impact of these problems on effect size-based meta-analysis results is difficult to determine within the existing limitations of the literature; therefore, meta-analysis methods that produce interpretable consistency measures are likely to provide guidance for future experimental investigation in this area. Given this is the ultimate goal, the Multi-Level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) coordinate-based approach is suitable [ ] in that it provides clear interpretability and is unbiased by number of within-study peaks (see more details below). However, an updated version of effect size signed differential mapping\u2014Seed-based   d   Mapping (SDM)\u2014has been released [ ], which can combine reported coordinates and   t  -maps, which are statistical parametric maps displaying the   t   statistic after estimation of the experimental parameters of interest for a given study. The   t   statistic is estimated at each voxel\u2014the small volumetric unit of the statistical parametric map (e.g. 2\u00a0mm )\u2014for the whole brain, which in the context of performing a meta-analysis allows estimation of effect sizes at each voxel. By increasing the number of   t  -maps entered into the analysis, this approach has increasing sensitivity while reducing false positives [ ]. The use of   t  -maps is preferable, as the inclusion of studies with reported coordinates requires the statistical estimation of unreported voxels. However, this approach relies on the availability of   t  -maps (e.g. as supplementary material or by direct researcher request). Therefore, if studies have a significant number of usable   t  -maps available (i.e. which will significantly increase sensitivity and decrease false positives), we will employ SDM in the first instance. Once data is extracted from eligible studies, maps of   d   values [ ] and their variances are then created for meta-analysis (see below for further synthesis details). \n\n\n## Methods\/design \n  \n### Aims \n  \nThe aim of the present study is to examine the effects of OT administration on human brain activity by synthesizing data from available research studies. This protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016038781) and has been reported here according to PRISMA-P [ ] guidelines (see Additional file  ). Pre-registration of the analysis protocol will also help avoid potential bias by providing documentation of a priori analysis plans [ ]. If protocol amendments are required, the PROSPERO registration will be updated. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we will include studies that meet the following criteria: (a) The study measured blood oxygenation level-dependent response using fMRI to assess response after OT administration; (b) the study provides standard Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates, allowing for comparison of findings; (c) the study includes a placebo comparison group; and (d) the study was written in English. A range of study designs (e.g. crossover, between-subjects) will be considered for inclusion as well as articles from the grey literature (e.g. pre-prints). Study authors will be contacted if any information germane to study inclusion is unclear. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nWe will conduct a systematic literature search to collect studies that explore the neural effects of OT administration. Searches will be performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar with the following combination of terms which were developed in consultation from two academic libraries: (\u201coxytocin\u201d OR \u201csyntocinon\u201d) AND (\u201cfMRI\u201d OR \u201cbrain imaging\u201d OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cMRI\u201d OR \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d). The search will be limited to articles published from 2005 (first fMRI OT study; 20) onwards. In a second iteration, reference lists within studies will be examined for remaining studies that include the critical measures. \n\n\n### Data extraction and management \n  \nTwo independent reviewers will independently scan primary titles to select articles for further scrutiny, deleting any duplicate titles. Abstracts of potentially eligible studies will then be read to determine eligibility for coding into a spreadsheet. When the title and abstract cannot be rejected, the full text of the article is obtained and reviewed for inclusion using a coding form. Any disagreements will be adjudicated by a third reviewer. If both reviewers agree that the trial does not meet eligibility criteria, it will be excluded. The two reviewers will then extract data from all eligible studies using a data extraction form. The coding forms will be developed specifically for this study, based on a pilot review, extraction, and calibration of five randomly included studies. Any disagreements regarding data extraction will be solved via discussion with a third reviewer. Data from studies initially selected based on title and abstract and articles included in the review will be documented. Reasons for the exclusion of retrieved articles will also be recorded for eventual documentation in a study search and data extraction flow diagram. \n\nAvailable coordinates will be extracted from eligible papers and entered into a data collection form. This form will include (a) general information on studies including authors and titles; (b) information about the participants including, gender, age, and physical and mental health status; (c) information about the level the study on other moderator variables, including study type, experimental paradigm, and cognition modality (e.g. visual, auditory); and (d) information concerning study characteristics (e.g. publication year) and the risk of bias measures as defined by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Corresponding authors from eligible studies will be contacted in order to request and obtain   t  -maps. In order to review and synthesize studies qualitatively, reported coordinates and peaks from   t  -maps (if available) will be plotted in MNI space for visualization and discussed in light of the methodologies employed and the authors\u2019 conclusions. \n\n\n### Risk of bias and strength of evidence \n  \nThe Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess risk of bias [ ]. This tool encompasses six domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias (i.e. bias problems not covered in the other domains). A table describing risk of bias across these domains for each included study will be provided to assess risk of bias within studies, as recommended [ ]. The strength of evidence will be assessed and reported using the GRADE system [ ]. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nA decision-making process for choice of quantitative statistical analysis is outlined as follows (Fig.\u00a0 ). Should   t  -maps be obtained, a combined coordinate and effect size-based meta-analysis using SDM will be possible; if not, a coordinate-only analysis using MKDA will be employed. In order to choose between approaches, a significant number of studies with available   t  -maps will need to be drawn, particularly given the likely low number of eligible studies available. Thus, if usable   t  -maps for 20% of studies are received and the analysis suits pooling data from the identified studies (given potentially differing methodological considerations), SDM analysis [ ] will be performed in the first instance. If less than 20% of studies have associated   t  -maps, a coordinate-only analysis will be performed using MKDA, after consideration of examining the identified studies for suitability for pooling [ ,  ].   \nDecision-making process for choice of meta-analytic approach.   SDM   Seed-based   d   Mapping,   MKDA   Multi-Level Kernel Density Analysis \n  \n\nSDM is an effect size-based approach that has been used to pool coordinate and   t  -map data largely from patient and control groups [ ,  ]. If SDM is chosen, analysis will be performed using the SDM tool package ( ). Available   t  -maps are simply converted to effect size   d   maps, and when only coordinates are available, an unnormalized Gaussian kernel (where a full width at half maximum is set, initially, 20\u00a0mm as recommended) is used to estimate effect size of voxels around the peak, which itself can is the only effect size that can be exactly calculated. Here, a random effects model would be implemented and carried out as recommended [ ], as applicable to pooling the identified studies. Each study will be weighted by the inverse of the sum of its variance plus the between-study variance using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator [ ], which gives greater weight to studies with smaller variance or larger sample size. The null hypothesis for SDM is that effect sizes are randomly distributed throughout the brain. Given that different   t  -maps will be thresholded with different correction methods, a combination of thresholds is recommended. Initially, an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u2009=\u2009.005 allows analysis of the robustness and heterogeneity of the findings with increasingly conservative thresholds. \n\nMKDA is a coordinate-based approach that has been previously used to assess the impact of psychopharmacological agents on neural activity [ ]. The MKDA statistic reflects the number of nominally independent contrast maps (i.e. statistical parametric maps from individual studies) that activate in the vicinity (e.g. within 10\u00a0mm) of each voxel in the brain; the null hypothesis is that the activation \u201cblobs\u201d from individual contrast maps are randomly distributed. Thus, a significant result indicates that more contrast maps activate near a specific voxel than expected by chance. If MKDA is chosen, analyses will be performed in MATLAB, using the MKDA tool package [ ;  ]. MKDA difference analysis will be conducted to directly contrast the OT and task type conditions. The threshold for statistical significance will be determined using a Monte Carlo simulation (5000 iterations) and provided family-wise error rate correction for multiple comparisons at   \u03b1  \u2009<\u2009.05 corrected. \n\nWith the employment of either primary approach, moderators will also be entered in as covariates in meta-regression analyses. Where applicable, a Jackknife sensitivity analysis\u2014where the same analysis will be repeated excluding one data point at a time\u2014will determine if results are replicable. Given concerns surrounding publication bias in biobehavioural oxytocin research [ ], a funnel plot of meta-analytic peaks will be constructed and analysed in order to determine publication bias in the collected sample as outlined by Egger and co-workers [ ]. Moreover, between-study heterogeneity will also be assessed by constructing heterogeneity   Q  -maps (and corresponding   p   values). These maps will reveal brain regions that show significant between-study heterogeneity. \n\n\n### Moderators \n  \nMany studies have explored the effects of OT on brain activity both during a task and at rest; however, the specific methods vary between studies. These methodological aspects include participant characteristics, experimental paradigm, OT dosage, and fMRI-related methodological differences. Moreover, the year of publication and overall study quality may also influence study effect sizes. Thus, the following potential moderator variables will be examined a priori in this meta-analysis to account for heterogeneity in the literature.   \nParticipants. The effects of OT may vary between healthy and clinical populations. Thus, we will examine whether population type acts as a moderator for effect sizes. Furthermore, we will examine whether effect sizes are moderated by gender and age of participants. \n  \nExperimental paradigms. These paradigms can vary in studies that investigate the effect of OT on brain activity during tasks. For instance, the primary modality assessed can include visual stimuli, auditory stimuli, and executive function. \n  \nOT dosage. While 24IU is the typically administered OT dose, other dosages are occasionally administered. Considering the dose-dependent effects of OT [ ], dosage will be included as a moderator where applicable. \n  \nfMRI methodology. The potential moderating effect of imaging package [ ] and field strength will also be investigated. \n  \nYear of publication. Early, more preliminary studies may potentially exhibit different effect sizes due to improvements in study methodology or publication bias [ ], so year of publication is included as an additional moderator to potentially assess bias. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThere is growing interest in the neural correlates of intranasal OT administration in an effort to better understand its cognitive and behavioural effects. However, there is little consensus on the specific brain regions associated with intranasal OT administration and the impact of moderators such as gender and experimental paradigm. The present protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis of fMRI studies that investigate the impact of intranasal OT. The inclusion of   t  -map data will provide greater precision than a coordinate-only analysis. The confidence in the body of evidence will also be assessed by measures of study quality and publication bias. Identification of specific brain regions underlying the effects of OT will assist future research and help identify treatment targets. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5129649,"text_md5":"9ad6dfbbf057ea85c6a5d5b057d50a59","field_positions":{"authors":[0,98],"journal":[99,107],"publication_year":[109,113],"title":[124,227],"keywords":[241,305],"abstract":[318,2438],"body":[2447,19098]},"batch":2,"pmid":27899138,"doi":"10.1186\/s13643-016-0386-2","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5129649","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5129649"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5129649\">5129649<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5129649  The impact of oxytocin administration on brain activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol"}

Evidence From a Meta-Analysis of the Neural Correlates of Working Memory Training Using Activation Likelihood Estimation\n\n# Keywords\n\nworking memory span\ntraining\ncognitive resource\nmeta-analysis\nexecutive functions\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nWorking memory (WM) is the system responsible for maintaining and manipulating information, in the face of ongoing distraction. In turn, WM span is perceived to be an individual-differences construct reflecting the limited capacity of this system. Recently, however, there has been some evidence to suggest that WM capacity can increase through training, raising the possibility that training can functionally alter the neural structures supporting WM. To address the hypothesis that the neural substrates underlying WM are targeted by training, we conducted a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of WM training using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE). Our results demonstrate that WM training is associated exclusively with decreases in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in clusters within the fronto-parietal system that underlie WM, including the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (BA 39\/40), middle (BA 9) and superior (BA 6) frontal gyri, and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 8\/32). We discuss the various psychological and physiological mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed reductions in the BOLD signal in relation to WM training, and consider their implications for the construct of WM span as a limited resource. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWorking memory (WM) is defined as \u201ca multicomponent system for active maintenance of information in the face of ongoing processing and\/or distraction\u201d ( , p. 770). Most classic accounts of WM have conceptualized this system to be limited in   capacity  , reflecting the underlying notion that it represents a limited resource (e.g.,  ;  ; for a review, see  ). Broadly speaking, a processing resource can be defined as \u201csomething that exists in limited supply and is responsible for the enhancing or enabling of certain cognitive processes\u201d ( , p. 102). Within the construct of WM,   capacity   reflects individual differences in the limit of this system, indicating that people can process only a certain amount of content at any given time. Examining   why   WM capacity is limited remains an active area of research, with candidate processes (to be described further, below) including temporal decay, limitations in cognitive resources and mutual interference of WM representations, among others (see  ). \n\nIn contrast to accounts which consider WM to be a resource-limited system which is only able to store and process a small, fixed number of items, some contemporary views have emphasized the flexibility with which information can be maintained and manipulated in WM. For example,   reviewed a large body of behavioral and neuroimaging data to argue for alternative resource models that do not invoke a fixed limit on how many items can be stored in short-term memory (e.g., magical number 4, or magical number 7\u2014plus or minus 2, etc.), but instead emphasize that WM capacity depends on the quality or precision with which items are processed. Such flexible resource models of WM assume that the internal representations of sensory stimuli are inherently noisy, and that this noise increases as the number of to-be-remembered items increases in memory (see  ;  ;  ). In turn, the extent to which any given item is recalled with precision depends on the quantity of resources devoted to processing it: As this quantity increases, there is a corresponding decrease in the noise associated with the item in memory, and increased likelihood of precise recall. Consistent with such accounts, it has been shown that there is less precision in the recall of items from memory as the number of to-be-remembered items increases, and increased precision in recall as their salience or goal-relevance increases ( ). The upshot of this contemporary work is that even when resources are limited, there can be flexibility in their allocation as a function of context and goals, which can in turn impact quality as well as quantity of recall. \n\n### Behavioral Effects of Working Memory Training \n  \nConsistent with such flexible notions of information processing in WM, there has been great interest recently in improving WM capacity, skills, and performance   via   targeted training (see  ). Indeed, several largescale meta-analyses and reviews of the behavioral literature have shown that WM training can lead to   near transfer  \u2014defined as performance improvements on short-term and WM tasks that are similar to the trained task ( ;  ;  ;  ; see also  ). Evidence for near transfer suggests that WM training likely targets cognitive processes that are commonly shared by most short-term memory and WM tasks, such as maintenance and updating of information. In contrast, there is little or no reliable evidence to suggest that WM training can lead to   far transfer  \u2014defined as observing performance benefits in outcome measures that are dissimilar to the trained task in terms of structure or surface features ( ; but see  ). There could be many reasons why reliable evidence for far transfer has not been observed. One reason could be that the untrained tasks likely recruit other capabilities in addition to WM that must also be targeted by training for benefits to be observed in performance, including perhaps other executive functions (e.g., switching and inhibition). Another possibility might be that the gains observed in WM span are due to the development of strategies that are applicable to only certain tasks but not others, or at least not to the same extent (e.g., chunking). Finally, it could also be that WM training only leads to gains in some aspects of WM span but not others (see  ), therefore limiting its broad utility. More generally, it is likely necessary to specify the dimensions along which far transfer can occur to optimize the goodness-of-fit between what is trained and the target tasks that it is meant to transfer to (see  ). \n\nConsistent with evidence that WM training can lead to near transfer, there are also findings to suggest that WM training can lead to gains in WM capacity. For example,   asked participants to complete a battery of near-, moderate-, and far-transfer tasks at baseline, followed by 20 sessions of training that consisted of one of following three conditions: Participants in the complex-span training condition completed adaptive versions of the operation-span and symmetry-span tasks during each session, whereas participants in the simple-span training condition completed two adaptive simple span tasks. In turn, the control condition consisted of participants who trained on an adaptive visual search task only. The same battery of near-, moderate-, and far-transfer tasks were completed after training. In terms of near transfer, the complex- span training group exhibited improvements on the rotation- and reading-span tasks, even though both contained different distractor tasks and different to-be-remembered items than the training tasks. Both the complex-span and simple-span training groups also showed improvement on the running-letter-span and running-spatial-span tasks. Because the same to-be-remembered stimuli were used for the training and running-span tasks, this improvement could be attributable to either an increase in WM capacity or learning of stimulus-specific strategies for remembering letters and matrix locations. In terms of moderate transfer, both the complex-span and simple-span training groups showed improvement on the secondary memory component of immediate free recall. In terms of far transfer, no group exhibited any gain in fluid intelligence. These results suggest that WM training can lead to improvement in WM span, although it is important to remember that one can observe such improvements without necessarily improving WM capacity at the construct level. This is because not all of the variance in WM span task performance reflects WM capacity, but can instead reflect other factors related to the performance (e.g., strategies, ability to chunk letters, and random error) ( ; see  ) and beyond (e.g., stress, fatigue, and sleep loss). As such, when improvement in WM capacity is observed, care must be exercised in interpreting what has been targeted and improved by training (see also  ,  ). \n\n\n### Process Specificity and the Brain \n  \nAlthough researchers have begun to gain traction on some of the processes and mechanisms underlying behavioral performance improvements associated with WM training\u2014including its possible moderators (see  ;  )\u2014relatively less is known about its neural correlates (see  ). Nevertheless, a number of insights have begun to emerge based on the available literature. First, there is good reason to believe that whether transfer does or does not occur depends in part on   process specificity  \u2014defined as the extent to which the specific cognitive process affected by the training task also underlies performance on the untrained task ( ). Examples of such processes include the storage of information, suppression of distractors, and updating of information (see  ). Process specificity is important at the neural level because the greater the functional similarities between the trained and untrained tasks, the greater the likelihood that the sets of brain regions underlying those tasks will also overlap. In this sense, brain imaging studies are useful because they can reveal possible neural mechanisms whereby training-related improvements and transfer could occur ( ;  ). \n\nFor example,   examined participants\u2019 brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a 5-week regimen of WM training. Neural data were obtained to assess training-related changes in brain activity. Training consisted of a letter memory task that focused specifically on updating of information in WM. The experimenters administered three tasks while participants underwent fMRI: The letter memory task, the   n  -back, and the Stroop task\u2014the latter two being the transfer tasks. Importantly, both the letter memory task and the   n  -back task involved updating of information in WM, whereas the Stroop task did not. Not surprisingly, all three tasks engaged the well-established fronto-parietal WM system. In terms of the two transfer tasks, the investigators reasoned that if transfer hinges on a shared fronto-parietal network, then it should be observed for both the   n  -back task and the Stroop task\u2014because both share activation in that region with the letter memory task. However, if transfer hinges specifically on updating of information in WM and is associated with shared activity in the striatal updating network, then it should be observed for the   n  -back task only. Indeed, the results supported the latter prediction, demonstrating that transfer occurs if the training task targets the same cognitive process and\/or mechanism that underlies the transfer task\u2014in this case updating of information in WM. \n\n\n### Increases and Decreases in Brain Activation \n  \nA second finding that has emerged from neuroimaging studies is that WM training can be correlated with both increases as well as decreases in brain activation, although the reasons behind this variability in the observed results are not well-understood. For example, in his early review of this literature   noted a pattern such that studies that involved short periods of WM training (<3 h) had been shown to result in decreased brain activity, whereas long periods of WM training had been shown to result in an admixture of both increased and decreased brain activity.   proposed that the decreases in activation could have occurred because of a number of different processes taking place, including strategy learning, priming during encoding, and time-on-task effects\u2014all of which have been shown to be correlated with reductions in brain activation (see also  ). In turn, during longer training regimens these reductions would be co-occurring with increases in WM capacity, which would in turn be correlated with activity in the intraparietal cortex, middle and superior frontal gyri, and the caudate nucleus. However, in their own review of largely the same literature on the neural effects of WM training,   called for additional data to understand the impact of WM training on neural function. Specifically, they reviewed evidence from several studies to demonstrate that WM training was associated with decreases in brain activation in many fMRI studies, suggesting that perhaps brain function can become more efficient with increased practice and expertise. Given that brains are metabolically expensive, the ability to perform tasks to the same or improved level with less energy expenditure would represent a significant adaptive benefit. \n\n review of the neuroimaging studies of WM training reached a conclusion quite similar to   in attempting to interpret patterns of neural activation and deactivation. Namely, they noted that the central executive component of   model of WM has been linked strongly to the fronto-parietal system.  Although greater activation in this system as a function of WM training can be attributed to either the recruitment of additional cortical units with practice or the strengthening of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response within a specific region, a far more common observation is a reduction in activation in this system in association with WM training. Such reductions could mean that the task was initially difficult and required resources from the central executive, but with practice became less difficult or required less conscious thought and thus required fewer resources\u2014and by extension less fronto-parietal involvement. \n\nInterestingly, the opposite pattern was perceived in subcortical areas such as the basal ganglia where brain activation was far more likely to increase following WM training.   argued that such increases in activation in subcortical areas could in turn reflect the strengthening of the specific skills in association with training (e.g., updating of information in WM). This two-pronged view suggests that during the early phases of learning the prefrontal cortex likely exercises cognitive control for the purpose of new rule and skill acquisition, whereas over time, when the previously novel rules and skills have been learned, the frontal lobes become less engaged and the acquired rules and skills are implemented by other neural systems (see  ;  ). Thus,   interpreted \u201cthe decreased cortical activation as an indication of more automatized task performance following training, and the increased striatal activation as a change in the underlying skill\u201d (p. 411). This interpretation is also consistent with the idea that rather than being a unitary construct, training can encompass the acquisition of new mental operations or shortcuts as well as reducing inefficiencies in existing processes. For example,   characterized three approaches to cognitive optimization that are analogous\u2014increasing the power of a cognitive capability, increasing the effect one can derive from an existing level of capacity, and providing external devices to perform cognitive tasks to reduce the need for using cognitive capabilities. Training might be viewed in a similar fashion\u2014increasing the capacity of WM, making WM more efficient, or off-loading some functions of WM to other cognitive capacities. In turn, these effects can be associated with variations in the structures and directions of BOLD activity change in relation to WM training. \n\nA fundamental problem when assessing this body of work concerns how to interpret the changes in the BOLD signal observed in relation to WM training. For example, in several cases to date, reductions in the BOLD signal due to training have been interpreted as reflecting increased efficiency of neural function.   has argued convincingly that such an interpretation is unjustified because a reduction in the BOLD signal does not necessarily mean that there is less energy expenditure for conducting the same task. Indeed, a reduction in the BOLD signal can be observed because a different set of cognitive processes and\/or neural computations are being performed\u2014neither of which means that there is reduced energy expenditure for the same amount of work. As noted by  , one could argue for neural efficiency if the same neural computation were being performed with identical time and intensity, but with different metabolic expenditure due to factors such as amount of transmitter release, nature of neurovascular coupling, or the degree to which the neural computations draw on oxidative vs. non-oxidative metabolism. However, such inferences require information about metabolism at the cellular level, which the BOLD signal does not provide ( ).   came to a similar conclusion when interpreting the literature on the neuroscience of WM training, as the changes in brain activation could be due to many physiological factors including the number and\/or the firing rate of the neurons during maintenance of representations in WM, among others. This prompted them to note that \u201cA cautious interpretation is thus that these fMRI studies point to the areas of change but do not inform us about the underlying cellular mechanisms\u201d (p. 444). Nevertheless, localizing where the changes occur and the direction in which they occur is a necessary first step for understanding the structures whose function is impacted by training, although subsequent research will be necessary to understand precisely why the changes have occurred, and the extent to which they reflect variations in metabolic expenditure at the cellular level. \n\n\n### Aims of Present Meta-Analysis \n  \nOur meta-analysis had three aims. The first aim was to reveal brain structures that are activated reliably across studies as a function of WM training. To this end, we employed the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) approach, which is a widely adopted coordinate-based platform for the quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging data ( ). To address this aim, we specifically restricted our focus to studies that involved pre-test and post-test assessments of WM performance with fMRI, and training regimens involving a WM task. We are aware of three earlier meta-analyses of the literature on the neural bases of WM training, with different scopes and aims than ours. First,   investigated the neural correlates of WM training in healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia. Next,   investigated the neural correlates of WM training in healthy adults, but also included studies in which the target fMRI task was not necessarily a WM task (e.g., multitasking, divergent thinking, etc.). In turn,   focused exclusively on studies that utilized a WM updating task as the training task (rather than a maintenance task, etc.) to achieve greater homogeneity across studies in terms of the specific process that was being trained. All three meta-analyses included data from elderly samples. Although these meta-analyses have made valuable and important contributions to our understanding of the neural bases of WM training, we believe that the present meta-analysis fills a unique niche in the literature. First, we focused exclusively on samples of neurologically healthy adults having a mean age of <65 years, given the well-established finding that older adults display overactivation in functional brain imaging studies, likely as a compensatory mechanism against age-related decline in cognition (for review, see  ; see also  ;  ). We reasoned that focusing on young-to-middle aged adults would reduce some of the heterogeneity in the findings due to the age-related differences in brain activation. Second, we focused exclusively on studies that has used a WM task both for training and for pre- and post-testing. The reason for this decision was to reduce heterogeneity in the tasks under consideration by focusing only on tasks that target WM function. We reasoned that by virtue of focusing on neurologically healthy non-senior adults who were trained and tested (pre- and post-training) exclusively on WM tasks, we would be in a position to examine whether training on any WM task can reliably impact brain function in regions of the brain that underlie WM in target tasks. Of particular interest were regions in the fronto-parietal network that have been consistently linked to performance and individual differences in this capacity ( ;  ;  ), as well as subcortical systems such as the basal ganglia ( ). \n\nThe second aim of our meta-analysis was to examine whether there are differences in brain regions that exhibit activation increases vs. decreases as a function of WM training (i.e., the directionality of training effects in the BOLD response). Indeed, one of the distinguishing features of individual studies to date has been the heterogeneity in the direction of change noted in brain activation following WM training, with some studies reporting exclusively increases or decreases in activations, whereas others have reported changes in both directions in different structures. As noted by   in their review of this literature, the results \u201csupport the views that training does not result in a monotonic increase or decrease in neural activity\u2026, and that training-related activation changes are not restricted to an isolated part of the brain. To better understand the neural reorganization that takes place after training, it is critical to identify neural networks underlying these activity changes\u201d (p. 410). To address this second aim, we distinguished between foci that have shown increases vs. decreases in activation, aiming to highlight the reliability of the directionality of the differences in response to WM training. Notably, all three meta-analyses of WM training to date have revealed an admixture of activity increases and decreases in the brain ( ;  ;  ). We were keen to examine whether a similar pattern would arise when the scope was limited to neurologically healthy non-elderly adults who were trained and tested (pre- and post-training) exclusively on WM tasks. \n\nThe third aim of our meta-analysis focused not on the neural data, but instead on behavioral data collected in a subset of the fMRI studies under examination that had administered WM span tasks pre- and post-training. This is because from a theoretical perspective, we were particularly interested in the impact of WM training on WM span. Therefore, aside from conducting the meta-analysis of fMRI data to address the first two aims of the study, we also conducted a descriptive review of the subset of studies that had administered WM span tasks pre- and post-training to examine the reliability of transfer from WM training to WM span, and to examine whether there are specific features of training and testing that increase the likelihood of that transfer. This descriptive review was meant to supplement the core meta-analysis of the fMRI data by shedding light on factors that facilitate transfer from WM training to WM span, and what the implications might be for models of WM that treat WM span as a limited resource. \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nThe identification of articles relating to WM training was conducted by a series of Boolean searches of PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases last updated in January 2022. The following keywords were used: \u201cworking memory training,\u201d \u201cbrain training,\u201d \u201ccognitive training,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d and \u201cPET.\u201d Furthermore, we examined review papers, past meta-analyses, and reference sections for additional studies. Our search yielded 341 references. These references were subsequently screened based on (a) article and journal title information, (b) abstract information, and (c) full-text evaluation (see  ). Ultimately, this yielded 32 studies (reported in 31 unique publications) for the meta-analysis. \n  \nFlow diagram for literature search. \n  \n\n### Selection Criteria \n  \nThe articles were screened for neurologically healthy participants. In cases where a neurologically healthy control group was included as a comparison condition for a patient group, the data from the former group were included in the meta-analysis if separate results had been reported (  n   = 2), or by contacting the authors to obtain results only from the neurologically healthy control sub-group (  n   = 1). We focused exclusively on studies that reported data from samples with a mean age of <65 years. All articles included a WM training regimen, although the specific training task varied across studies. Furthermore, in each case the pre- and post-test measures were also WM tasks. In some cases, the pre- and post-test WM measures were identical to the WM training task, whereas in others it was a different WM task that was implemented for training vs. pre- and post-testing ( ). \n  \nList of 32 studies included in the meta-analysis. \n    \nAll selected studies included neuroimaging data collected prior to and following WM training (i.e., pre- and post-test). In cases where post-test neuroimaging data were collected at two time points following the termination of WM training (e.g., immediately after training and again >1 month after training), we focused on the time point nearest to the termination of training (i.e., immediately after training). This allowed for a direct comparison of post-test data across studies using immediate vs. immediate   and   delayed methodologies, eliminating this potential confound. All the studies reported voxel-wise, whole brain data which reported foci in 3D coordinate space (i.e., not ROI analysis). In cases where the performance of an experimental group (i.e., WM training) was compared to a control group (i.e., active or passive control) at pre- and post-test time points, we selected the results of the Group \u00d7 Time interaction effect for analysis. In cases where only the results of the training group were available\/reported at pre- and post-test, we included in our analysis the coordinates associated with the simple main effect of training. In both cases above, if the authors reported results separately for different levels of difficulty of the same task (e.g., 3-back vs. 2-back for n-back at post-test compared to 1-back at pre-test), we selected the contrast that isolated the neural correlates of the more difficult level (i.e., 3-back at post-test compared to 1-back at pre-test rather than 2-back at post-test compared to 1-back at pre-test). In total, 31 articles that included 32 studies met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, including data from 813 participants and 385 foci ( ). \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nALE is a quantitative meta-analysis technique that compares activation likelihoods calculated from observed activation foci with a null distribution of randomly generated activation likelihoods. It pools peak activation coordinates across studies that have investigated an effect of interest ( ). These coordinates must be spatially renormalized to a single template. For this meta-analysis, all coordinates were renormalized to MNI space using the icbm2tal transformation ( ) implemented in the GingerALE 3.0.2 toolbox (Research Imaging Center of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX).  The resulting coordinates were used to generate \u201cactivation likelihoods\u201d for each voxel in the brain. For each focus, ALE computes each voxel as a function of its distance from that focus using a three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function centered at its coordinates. This generates vectors of values for each voxel representing probabilities of belonging to a specific focus. These values are assumed to be independent such that the existence of one focus does not give information about whether another focus will occur. The vector values are combined with the addition rule for log-probabilities, yielding ALE statistics. Thus, the ALE statistic represents the probability of a certain voxel to belong to any of the included foci. Significance tests are conducted by comparing the ALE statistic in each voxel with a null distribution, generated   via   repeatedly calculating ALE statistics from randomly placed activation foci. This null distribution is then used to estimate the threshold based on a given cut-off. Finally, a cluster threshold (i.e., minimum spatial extent of significant contiguous clusters) can be applied. As recommended in  , we conducted our analyses based on a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction, which involves using an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold (  p   < 0.001) and employing a cluster-extent threshold (  p   < 0.05) that controls the chance of observing a cluster of that size if foci were randomly distributed\u2014implemented in GingerALE 3.0.2 ( ). We used 1,000 thresholding permutations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Omnibus Analysis \n  \nThe results of the omnibus analysis spanning all 32 studies revealed that WM training was associated with the involvement of the fronto-parietal system encompassing clusters in the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 6\/32) (  and  ). \n  \nThe neural correlates of working memory training. Across all studies, working memory training engaged clusters encompassing the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 6\/32) (depicted in red). In turn, working memory training was associated with decreases in brain activation in clusters encompassing the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (BA 39\/40), middle (BA 9), and superior (BA 6) frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 8\/32) (depicted in blue) (see text,  ,  ). The transparencies of the activations are set to 50% to reveal three areas of overlap in the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 6\/32). IPL, inferior parietal lobule; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; SFG, superior frontal gyrus; MEFG, medial frontal gyrus. \n    \nThe neural correlates of working memory training across all studies. \n    \n\n### Increases vs. Decreases in Activation \n  \nNext, we separated the 385 foci based on whether they had been reported as increases (176) or decreases (209) in activation in previous studies, and conducted the meta-analysis separately for each group of foci. The results demonstrated that WM training was associated with decreases in brain activation in clusters within the fronto-parietal system that underlie WM, encompassing the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (BA 39\/40), middle (BA 9) and superior (BA 6) frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 8\/32) (  and  ). In contrast, the analysis of foci which had exhibited increases in activation in previous studies did not reveal any cluster associated with WM training. \n  \nClusters exhibiting reduced brain activation in relation to working memory training. \n    \n\n### Impact of Training on Working Memory Span: Behavioral Results \n  \nOf the 32 fMRI studies included in the present meta-analysis, we identified a subset of seven studies that had administered WM span tasks before and after training. Importantly, those measures were not necessarily the tasks that were administered in the fMRI scanner before and after WM training, but were more commonly included as part of the larger set of neuropsychological measures to assess near and far transfer effects from WM training to other outcome measures. Nevertheless, a descriptive review of those studies is useful for examining the extent to which WM training can transfer to measures of WM span\u2014both simple and complex. Measures of simple WM generally involve presenting participants with a list of to-be-remembered items (e.g., letters, digits, or words) which they must subsequently recall in the correct serial order (e.g., forward or backward) (see  ). As such, span subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2014Revised (WAIS-R:  ) can be considered measures of simple WM span.   administered the WAIS-R Digit-Span and Spatial-Span tasks to participants in the adaptive or non-adaptive WM training groups before and after training. The results demonstrated a Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction on both Digit Span and Spatial Span such that the (adaptive) WM training group registered significantly greater gains on both measures than did the non-adaptive control group.  , Experiment 2) administered the WAIS-R Digit Span task to participants before and after a 5-week regimen of visuospatial WM training, observing significant post-training gains compared to baseline.   administered the German version of the WAIS, the Hamburg-Wechsler-Intelligenztest f\u00fcr Erwachsene\u2014Revision (HAWIE-R;  ) digit span sub-test (forward and backward versions) ( ) to experimental and control participants before and after training. The HAWIE-R digit span sub-test requires one to repeat up to nine numbers in the same order as read aloud by the examiner (forward version), and afterward in reverse serial order (backward version). They observed a Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction effect, such that there was a performance increase in the experimental group and a performance decrease in the control group. In contrast,   did not observe WM training-related gains in simple WM span as measured by the WAIS-R. Specifically, they administered the WAIS-R Digit Span task to participants who either trained on a WM task or were in a passive control condition before and after training, and did not observe a Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction effect. Rather than administering the WAIS-R,  , Experiment 1) administered a different simple WM span measure referred to as \u201cLetter Memory,\u201d which consisted of ten lists of serially presented letters (A-D) of varying length (7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 13, 9, 15, 13, 15). The task was to recall the last four letters as quickly as possible following the termination of the presentation. The results demonstrated a Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction such that the (updating) WM training group registered significantly greater gains in Letter Memory than did the control group. \n\nIn turn, some of the studies administered measures of complex WM span before and after WM training. As noted by  , like simple span tasks, complex span tasks also require participants to recall a set of to-be-remembered items in their correct, but in addition some form of processing activity is interleaved between the to-be-remembered items. For example,   administered the Automated Operation Span Task (AOSPAN:  ) and the WAIS-R Digit Span task to their participants who were randomized to either the WM training or active control condition at pre- and post-test (see  ). The AOSPAN is \u201ca complex measure of WM which requires participants to remember the sequential ordering of presented stimuli while carrying out simple mathematic problems as a distraction\u201d ( , p. 8). The Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction was not observed for either outcome measure. In turn,   administered complex WM span measures involving verbal stimuli with the AOSPAN ( ) and involving visual stimuli with a change localization ( ) version of the Change Detection task ( ). Here, too, Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interactions were not observed. However, it is important to note those two WM span tasks were selected specifically because they target the executive function of updating   without   changing the demand on WM capacity itself. For that reason, the fact that training-related improvements in WM updating performance did not transfer to complex WM span measures was not surprising. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis examined the neural correlates of WM training, with three aims in mind. Below, we will discuss the results with respect to each aim in a separate subsection. \n\n### General Neural System Sensitive to Working Memory Training \n  \nBased on a substantial body of evidence linking performance and individual differences in WM tasks to the fronto-parietal system, we had predicted that this system would be modulated by WM training across studies. This prediction was confirmed with respect to the omnibus analysis involving all studies (  and  ). As noted by   in their meta-analysis of a largely overlapping set of studies of WM training, \u201ccurrent brain imaging evidence does not provide evidence of areas that would be sensitive to learning   per se   but rather emphasizes the modulation of the core systems\u201d (p. 117). It appears that the same inference can be drawn from the present meta-analysis, focused as it was on neurologically healthy non-senior adults that were tested and trained on WM tasks exclusively. There is evidence to show that the posterior cortices are the primary site where WM representations are stored and rehearsed, and that the frontal lobes become important contributors to the process when there is interference during a retention interval ( ), or a need for top-down regulation of stored content ( ). The present results suggest that WM training might have a modulatory effect, both on brain regions that store information as well as those that act on stored memory representations. \n\nInterestingly, however, subcortical structures, such as those in the basal ganglia, did not exhibit involvement in WM training, despite the fact that they have been regularly engaged by WM tasks ( ). This could perhaps be explained by the dissociation noted by   regarding the involvement of the fronto-parietal system vs. subcortical regions in WM training. Namely, they noted that whereas the fronto-parietal system may play a more central role in the executive aspects of WM training, the subcortical regions may play a more critical role in the acquisition of skills during WM. Because many different types of tasks emphasizing different types of skills were employed for WM training across studies ( ), the variation in the specific skills targeted by training might have engaged different subcortical regions, thereby not coalescing in a shared subcortical region across studies. Indeed, there has even been some variation in previous meta-analyses of WM training studies in terms of the engagement of subcortical structures. For example,   did not report the reliable engagement of subcortical regions in WM training, whereas subcortical regions did emerge in the meta-analyses conducted by   and  . Focusing strictly on WM updating studies,   reported consistent fronto-parietal activity decreases, but an admixture of activity increases and decreases in subcortical regions. Reviewing specific studies in the area, they noted that subcortical regions were more likely to be engaged if the training regimen had specifically involved a WM updating task than other varieties of WM tasks. As such, they argued that subcortical systems are more likely to be engaged by WM training if the task necessitates goal-directed flexibility\u2014a hallmark of updating tasks. In support of this view,   reviewed theoretical frameworks according to which subcortical systems are hypothesized to play an important role in exhibiting goal-directed flexibility in behavior, in part   via   their interplay with the prefrontal cortex ( ;  ). In turn,  , who explored differences in the neural systems that support WM training vs. perceptual-motor learning, noted that the striatum was involved in both processes. This suggests that rather than making a unique contribution to WM   per se  , the striatum likely makes a domain-independent contribution to learning in both cases. Indeed, their analysis demonstrated that what distinguished WM training from perceptual-motor learning was the engagement of the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the former process, although higher striatal and ventrolateral prefrontal activations coupled with lower activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were better predictors of transfer to other untrained WM tasks. Echoing  , these results suggest that \u201cthe functional roles of the transfer-related regions showing enhanced brain activity suggest that near transfer may not be based on modulation of core WM processes, but on the development of relatively task-specific skills\u201d ( , p. 119). \n\n\n### Increases vs. Decreases in Activation \n  \nWhen we examined the neural correlates of WM training separately for foci that had exhibited increases vs. decreases in fMRI studies, our results demonstrated that WM training is associated exclusively with decreases in brain activation in clusters within the fronto-parietal system that underlie WM, including bilateral inferior parietal lobule (BA 39\/40), middle (BA 9) and superior (BA 6) frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 8\/32). This observation was somewhat surprising, given that all three previous meta-analyses of WM training had revealed an admixture of activity increases and decreases in the brain ( ;  ;  ). There could be a few explanations for the divergence of our results with previous meta-analytic studies. First, we opted to focus exclusively on samples of neurologically healthy adults with mean age <65 years, given the well-established finding that older adults display overactivation in functional brain imaging studies, likely as a compensatory mechanism against age-related decline ( ; see also  ;  ). We opted not to focus on the elderly to reduce that possible source of variability in our findings. It is possible that not including those studies may have impacted our findings, although there has been quite a bit of heterogeneity in findings involving the elderly as there have been reports of both increases ( ;  ) as well as decreases ( ;  ) in brain activity in relation to WM training. An additional reason might be the choice of training and\/or target tasks that formed the focus of our analysis. In terms of the former, it is possible that WM training tasks that target updating might facilitate increases in brain activity in regions that underlie learning of skills and strategies ( ). In turn, extending the pre- and post-training measures to tasks that measure other abilities aside from WM (e.g., multitasking and divergent thinking) might engage structures that exhibit increases in brain activity due to the cognitive requirements of those tasks ( ). Our findings combined with those of others suggests that even when the focus of the meta-analysis is largely on the same literature, the specific choice of studies can have a noticeable effect on findings, and should be taken into consideration when drawing inferences from the work. \n\nOne possible lens for interpreting the reductions observed in brain activation in relation to WM training is in terms of increased expertise. Specifically, it could be argued that repeated practice on the same task, especially in cases where the task was adaptive, likely resulted in greater proficiency in the maintenance and manipulation of information in WM, and that this greater proficiency (i.e., expertise) was reflected in reductions in the BOLD signal in the fronto-parietal WM network. Here we can ask whether expertise is reliably associated with reductions in neural activation across domains.   conducted an ALE meta-analysis exploring the neural correlates of cognitive expertise in several domains (mental calculation, chess, language, memory, and music without motor involvement), and found that compared to non-experts, experts were more likely to exhibit activation increases rather than decreases. It is important to note that in the studies analyzed by  , persons needed to have had many years of training to qualify as true experts in a domain. It is therefore possible that short-term increases in skill acquisition might lead to reductions in brain activation, whereas true expertise that typically emerges following long-term engagement with domain-specific tasks eventually leads to increases in brain activation (see  ). In addition to a focus on increases and decreases in brain activation, it is also important to note that in domains such as music, skill learning and expertise are associated not only with increases and decreases in brain activation but also with cortical reorganization, including the formation of new functional connections between brain regions (see  ). Although the focus of the present meta-analysis has been on differences in the direction of activations, examining changes in the connectivity of large-scale brain systems and structures in relation to WM training can certainly add to our understanding of its neural bases. \n\n\n### Impact of Working Memory Training on Span \n  \nAlthough our focus was on the neuroanatomy of WM training, we were also interested in examining whether the studies reported transfer to measures of WM span. We reviewed the results separately for studies of simple vs. complex span, given that they draw on different processes ( ). Seven studies from the identified subsample administered measures of simple WM span at pre- and post-test. In the case of three studies, WM training led to statistically significant gains in WM capacity ( ;  ;  , Experiment 2). A common feature of the training regimens in all three studies was that the task was adaptive, meaning that the level of difficulty was adjusted automatically to maintain maximal cognitive exertion. In contrast,   and  ) who did not use an adaptive version of a WM task found no transfer effect to simple WM span. Finally,   did find a statistically significant Group (Training vs. Control) \u00d7 Time (pre- vs. post-training) interaction effect, but the interpretation of this effect is complicated by the fact that the performance increase in the experimental group was paired with a performance decrease in the control group. On balance, it seems that when the WM training task is adaptive, then there is a higher likelihood of transfer to simple WM span. In turn, when we switch to complex WM span, there is simply insufficient evidence to infer whether one can observe transfer or not. Specifically,  ) found no effect of training on AOSPAN. Furthermore,   found no effect of training on AOSPAN ( ) or with a change localization ( ) version of the Change Detection task ( ), although as noted earlier their focus during training was on WM updating rather than on expanding WM span itself. On balance, it would be prudent to conclude that more research is needed to determine whether WM training can transfer to complex WM span (see also  ). \n\nTwo additional points deserve attention here. First, as noted by  , training can impact performance in many ways, such as increasing the power of a cognitive capability, increasing the effect one can derive from an existing level of capacity, and providing external devices to perform cognitive tasks that reduce the need for using cognitive capabilities. In turn, not all of those training outcomes would be equally likely to impact WM capacity   per se  , such that one might observe improvements in WM performance that are not necessarily accompanied by gains in WM span. Second, as noted earlier, there is some evidence to suggest that WM training can lead to near transfer, but there is no such evidence regarding far transfer ( ;  ;  ;  ; see also  ). Although that specific question was not under investigation here, a similar picture emerged across the 32 studies included in our meta-analysis.   who examined that question formally by conducting a meta-analysis of the behavioral data associated with neuroimaging studies of WM updating found a moderate and statistically significant effect for near transfer (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.63), but a small and statistically non-significant effect for near transfer (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.15). These relatively weak transfer effects likely have a bearing on the neuroanatomy of WM training insofar as one might expect that more robust neural changes would accompany more robust behavioral\/performance changes. As the size of this literature grows, it would be important to compare the impact of WM training for studies that report successful vs. unsuccessful near- and far-transfer effects. \n\n\n### Working Memory Training and Cognitive Resources \n  \nTypically, reductions in brain activation in relation to WM training have been attributed to neural efficiency. However, as noted by  , one could argue for neural efficiency only if the same neural computations were being performed with identical time and intensity, but with different metabolic expenditure. Unfortunately, due to our incomplete understanding of the cellular basis of the BOLD signal ( ), coupled with the fact that we cannot rule out other factors with certainty (e.g., whether different set of cognitive processes and\/or neural computations are being performed), we are not in a position to equate reductions in brain activation in relation to WM training within the fronto-parietal system to neural efficiency ( ). Nevertheless, it is prudent to consider the contribution of several candidate processes to this pattern of findings. First, it is possible that the observed pattern is driven by a shift from controlled to automatic processing ( ). Specifically, it is well known that engagement with an initially novel task can be more effortful, whereas repeated engagement and familiarization with the same task can lead to greater levels of automaticity in task performance. This transition from controlled to automatic processing is captured by dual-process models of cognition that involve an interplay between effortful and automatic processing in the service of task performance ( ;  ;  ). In this sense, it is possible that the reduction in brain activation due to WM training could be due to greater automaticity in WM performance because of familiarization (see  ). Second, decreased brain activity could reflect increased specificity and precision for detecting stimuli\u2014what has been referred to as   narrowing of tuning curves   ( ). As noted by  , a narrower tuning curve could be an indicator that fewer prefrontal or parietal neurons are necessary for coding a stimulus, which will be associated with a lower BOLD response. A third possibility is of course that fewer neurons are engaged for performing the same task post-training\u2014a possibility that has not been tested directly in this domain. \n\nFinally, what do the findings mean for our understanding of WM capacity as a   processing resource   (i.e., an entity that exists in limited supply and is responsible for the enhancing or enabling cognitive processes,  )? Historically, scholars who have considered the psychological reality of limited processing resources (or \u201cmental energy\u201d) have typically also assumed that those resources have a physiological correlate (see  ). In this sense, one would expect that if WM training were to increase WM capacity, then there should be a corresponding change in activity in the neurological system that supports it. Although WM training leads to decreases in activation in the fronto-parietal system, it is not possible to infer that this reflects an increase in WM capacity   per se  . Not only is more research needed to examine how variations in the activity of the fronto-parietal system are related to variations in WM capacity measures, but it is also necessary to consider the broader context within which limited processing resources are measured. As noted by   in his classic criticism of resource models, \u201cresource theory ascribes variability in performance of a task to the amount of some limited   internal input   dedicated to the task\u201d (italics added, p. 217). However, we now know that performance on such tasks and our subjective assessments thereof (e.g., workload) are influenced by a host of contextual, environmental, and motivational factors that likely interact with those internal inputs dedicated to the task. In this sense, examining the neural correlates of constructs hypothesized to be limited by processing resources needs to be informed better by the assumptions that characterize their measurement. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur meta-analysis demonstrated that WM training is associated with reduced activation in a set of regions that reside within the fronto-parietal system, including the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (BA 39\/40), middle (BA 9) and superior (BA 6) frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus bordering on the cingulate gyrus (BA 8\/32) (  and  ). This pattern of findings suggests that WM training targets neural structures that are involved in the storage, rehearsal, and\/or manipulation of mental representations within the core fronto-parietal system that supports WM. Importantly, due to our incomplete understanding of the cellular processes that underlie the BOLD signal, coupled with the fact that we cannot rule out other factors with certainty (e.g., whether different sets of cognitive processes and\/or neural computations are being performed), it is not possible to isolate a specific mechanism that can explain the biological basis of the observed reduction in brain activation as a function of WM training. When viewed in the context of extant meta-analytic evidence suggesting that WM training reduces brain activation within the fronto-parietal system ( ;  ;  ), our results underscore the importance of developing paradigms to examine the biological basis of the observed effect, and thus lead to an improved understanding of what this finding means for resource models of WM. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nOV, VR, SF, and QL contributed to the conception and design of the study.

This study was planned to find the effects of ECT on brain connectivity by conducting a systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of the studies performing resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in patients with depression receiving ECT. \n\n Methods:   We systematically searched the databases published up to July 31, 2020, for studies in patients having depression that compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before and after a course of pulse wave ECT. Meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method after extracting details about coordinates, voxel size, and method for correction of multiple comparisons corresponding to the significant clusters and the respective rsFC analysis measure with its method of extraction. \n\n Results:   Among 41 articles selected for full-text review, 31 articles were included in the systematic review. Among them, 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis, and a total of 73 foci of 21 experiments were examined using activation likelihood estimation in 10 sets. Using the cluster-level interference method, one voxel-wise analysis with the measure of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and one seed-voxel analysis with the right hippocampus showed a significant reduction (  p   < 0.0001) in the left cingulate gyrus (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and a significant increase (  p   < 0.0001) in the right hippocampus with the right parahippocampal gyrus, respectively. Another analysis with the studies implementing network-wise (posterior default mode network: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) resting state functional connectivity showed a significant increase (  p   < 0.001) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. There was considerable variability as well as a few key deficits in the preprocessing and analysis of the neuroimages and the reporting of results in the included studies. Due to lesser studies, we could not do further analysis to address the neuroimaging variability and subject-related differences. \n\n Conclusion:   The brain regions noted in this meta-analysis are reasonably specific and distinguished, and they had significant changes in resting state functional connectivity after a course of ECT for depression. More studies with better neuroimaging standards should be conducted in the future to confirm these results in different subgroups of depression and with varied aspects of ECT. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment holds an important place in the management of depression (Hermida et al.,  ); it is more clinically and cost effective than other non-invasive brain stimulation methods in pharmacotherapy-resistant depression (Magnezi et al.,  ). The opening of different avenues of investigational modalities in the last 20 years has promoted a detailed examination of mechanisms of the effects of ECT vis-\u00e0-vis the neurobiology of depression to improve its applicability and tolerability (Li et al.,  ). Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is one such technique of neuroimaging, with which the spontaneous activities of the brain during rest are recorded through blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals (Biswal et al.,  ). In comparison to stimulus-based acquisition protocols (task based) of fMRI, this is not only simpler, but it also can identify functionally and spatially distinct modes with greater biological interpretability (Fox and Raichle,  ; Van Dijk et al.,  ). There are different analysis strategies\/measures available for rsfMRI to understand the intrinsic functional connectivity at rest such as regional homogeneity (ReHo) (Zang et al.,  ), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) (Cordes et al.,  ) or fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) (Zou et al.,  ), resting state network based functional connectivity (FC) (Raichle et al.,  ; Beckmann et al.,  ), global measures-FC (Friston,  ; Salvador et al.,  ), and graph theory and network (GTN) analysis (Bullmore and Sporns,  ; Farahani et al.,  ). Under these strategies, many additional methodological approaches for extracting data are possible based on the research question, such as seed-voxel analysis, voxel-wise analysis, and local and global measures of network in graph theory (Smith,  ). Each of them provides a window of opportunity to examine the FC of the brain noninvasively. \n\nThe rsfMRI studies using the abovementioned measures and methods and other kinds of neuroimaging studies have helped us to understand the disease mechanisms of depression. A recent meta-analysis on structural MRI\u2013based studies in a depressed population established evidence of global atrophy of bilateral hippocampus (HC) (Santos et al.,  ). This finding adds to the integrated model of neurobiological, cognitive, and psychological construct toward the theory of neuronal loss and reduction of synaptic plasticity in HC and probably in the region of medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in patients with depression (Price and Duman,  ). Task-based fMRI in depression shows increased FC of the amygdala with HC and that of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and insula and middle frontal gyrus with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during emotional\/pain-related tasks (Helm et al.,  ). The sgACC could differentiate depressed patients from healthy controls in an rsfMRI study with both group-level clustering consistency and individual-level classification consistency of 92.5% (Zeng et al.,  ). In general, rsfMRI-based studies support the involvement of frontal, prefrontal, and limbic structures in depression with lesser consistency for a specific region (Helm et al.,  ). Other areas showing increased resting state FC (rsFC) in patients with depression include the right amygdala with ventral anterior putamen and reduced rsFC in middle occipital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex in the left hemisphere (Gray et al.,  ). \n\nThe neurobiological processes involved in the treatment of depression are said to be better understood with antidepressants than with different brain stimulation treatments and psychotherapy. Different antidepressants in task-based fMRI studies are found to normalize the increased activation of the amygdala and ACC, particularly sgACC, to negative emotional tasks and also to improve the activation of these regions to positive emotions (Arnone,  ). In a few studies, antidepressants also reduced the activation in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) with anticipatory cues\/self-referential tasks and in the insula with negative emotions\/pain-related tasks. The findings of rsfMRI studies, on the other hand, are too variable to give specific interpretations for the effects of antidepressants beyond the involvement of prefrontal and limbic structures and the default mode network (DMN) (Fonseka et al.,  ; Arnone,  ). The neuroimaging predictors considered for response to antidepressants include HC, amygdala, ACC, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), insula, orbitofrontal cortex, dlPFC, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC); however, there is less consensus about the direction of change in these predictor regions (Fonseka et al.,  ). \n\nECT-associated structural changes in the brain in patients with depression are probably more reliable than similar changes with other treatments for depression (Enneking et al.,  ). These findings are also more consistent than the other neuroimaging modality\u2013related findings in ECT. According to a recent systematic review, gray matter volume (GMV) of the amygdala, HC, and ACC increases in patients with depression following administration of ECT (Enneking et al.,  ). This review did not find these changes to be associated with the response to ECT. However, an earlier systematic review focusing only on limbic structures notes a negative association of the left HC GMV with a better clinical response to ECT (Takamiya et al.,  ). Similarly, another systematic review on baseline predictors reports that reduced GMV of HC and increased GMV of the amygdala and sgACC are predictive of a better ECT response in depression (Levy et al.,  ). Reviews are available that looked at changes in rsFC with ECT in depression. They include the other studies related to either other treatments for depression (Brakowski et al.,  ; Fonseka et al.,  ) or using other neuroimaging modalities with ECT (Abbott et al.,  ; Bolwig,  ; Zhuo and Yu,  ; Yrondi et al.,  ). These reviews provide a broad notion about rsfMRI effects of ECT as altered FC in DMN, sgACC, central executive network, and dlPFC. \n\nThe above description of neuroimaging findings of depression and its various treatments, including ECT, is inferred from the narrative and systematic reviews. Another systematic approach of review, the meta-analysis, can correct the distorting effects of sampling error, measurement error, and other artifacts that produce the illusion of conflicting findings (Schmidt and Hunter,  ). A meta-analysis may, thus, better integrate the findings across studies to reveal the specific patterns of relationships. This is particularly relevant in the fMRI field, considering the low power of individual studies and the variability present in scanning, preprocessing, and analysis of neuroimages in these studies (Samartsidis et al.,  ; Muller et al.,  ). With the development and progress in methods of coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) in the last 10 years, the meta-analytic approach of review has become increasingly common. Unlike image-based meta-analysis (IBMA), which requires the sharing of full image data, CBMA requires mainly information related to cluster size, its peak voxel coordinates, and related statistical methods used for analyzing neuroimages. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), one of the most common methods described under CBMA (Samartsidis et al.,  ), has been utilized in meta-analysis for fMRI studies in depression. One such meta-analysis, focusing on the treatment of depression, finds a series of regions having altered FC with psychotherapy and activation in insula with antidepressants (Boccia et al.,  ), and a recent study using ALE on rsFC in all treatments for depression, including non-invasive brain stimulation, finds predictors for response to rTMS but not for ECT (Long et al.,  ). The major issues with both these papers and many other neuroimaging meta-analyses exploring the neurobiology of depressive disorders (Sacher et al.,  ; Kuhn and Gallinat,  ) is they include the inappropriate combining of studies with different measures\/extraction methods of rsfMRI (seed-based, ICA, ALFF, ReHo, FCD) (Zang et al.,  ) and inadequate qualitative analysis of the whole neuroimaging process of the included studies (Poldrack et al.,  ; Weber et al.,  ; Roiser et al.,  ; Soares et al.,  ). \n\nThus, we planned a systematic review and CBMA using ALE of the studies performing rsfMRI before and after a course of ECT in patients having depression. The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to provide definite and specific patterns of rsFC associated with ECT in depression by synthesizing the findings of different modalities of rsfMRI. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search Strategies and Study Selection \n  \nIn this systematic review, we follow the recommendations provided in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al.,  ). A systematic literature search was performed in the following four electronic databases: PubMed, Medline, Pro Quest, and Web of Science library. The terms put together for this search are shown below: \n  \n(electroconvulsive) OR (electroconvulsive therapy) OR (ECT) OR (Shock therapy) \n  \nAND \n  \n(depression) OR (depressive disorder) \n  \nAND \n  \n(resting state functional connectivity) OR (rsfMRI) OR (rs-fMRI) OR (bold rest) OR (rest fMRI) OR (functional connectivity at rest) OR (fMRI) \n  \nThe search was conducted initially on April 1, 2020, and then it was repeated on July 31, 2020. A total of 477 studies were obtained, and they were then entered into the reference citation manager (Endnote X9) to remove the duplicates. Further selection of the articles was done on the basis of the following criteria. \n\n#### Inclusion Criteria \n    \nProspective observational\/ randomized study \n  \nSubjects in the study having an episode of depression of any severity based on either DSM-IV\/5 or ICD-10 irrespective of whether it is part of bipolar affective disorder or major depressive disorder, i.e., unipolar (single episode or recurrent depressive disorder) \n  \nSubjects in the study received constant current, pulse-wave modified ECT with any electrode placement and any set of electrical parameters \n  \nSubjects in the study at least underwent rsfMRI of brain on 2 occasions: (1) Prior to the beginning of the ECT course or (2) either at the end of the ECT course or after any fixed number of sessions. \n  \nThere was no constraint in this review on the concurrent use of any medications for the treatment of depressive episodes. \n\n\n#### Exclusion Criteria \n    \nCase reports or case series \n  \nSingle ECT session \n  \nSimultaneous treatment with any other brain stimulation technique \n  \nComorbid severe mental illness or neurological illness. \n  \nAll 3 authors (PS, HJ, DI) of this manuscript reviewed the title and abstract of each article independently as per the abovementioned criteria. The studies that clearly satisfy the criteria or whose exclusion could not be confirmed based on review of the abstract, they were selected for acquisition of the full text. The final inclusion to the meta-analysis and systematic review was made after reviewing the full text. In case of any disagreement between any two reviewers during any step of the review, the third reviewer's decision was considered. \n\n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThe data was extracted for each study under 2 major categories: subject characteristics and neuroimaging characteristics. The study was identified by its first author, journal, and year of publication. The details noted for the study sample included demography, psychiatry diagnosis along with specifically used clinical features as inclusion criteria (if present), pre- and post-ECT scores on rating scales used for depression, all standard ECT procedure\u2013related information, and details of the concurrent psychotropics. Under the neuroimaging category, details about both scanning and preprocessing of rsfMRI, particulars of measures and methods of extraction undertaken to process the rsfMRI images, the statistical approaches adopted to analyze the differences between pre- and post-ECT neuroimages, and results of the analysis pertaining to rsfMRI were recorded. \n\nUnlike the availability of tools for assessing the quality of general epidemiological, diagnostic, and intervention-related studies, we could not find any specific tool to rate the quality of fMRI aspects of a study. However, there are reviews (Waheed et al.,  ) and a few guidelines (Poldrack et al.,  ; Weber et al.,  ; Roiser et al.,  ; Soares et al.,  ) available focusing on how to conduct and report fMRI-based clinical studies. Based on these recommendations, we prepared a set of variables related to the process and analysis of rsfMRI as well as the display of results in the text, tables, and figures. There were a few articles for which the required information about the coordinates of peak voxel and cluster size of the significant regions were unavailable in their full text and  . We sought that information by writing to the respective corresponding authors. \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation Analysis \n  \nCBMA of rsfMRI data was performed using a revised version of the ALE algorithm (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) implemented in GingerALE 3.0.2. The consistency of the coordinates was assured using either Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI) coordinates or converting them into an MNI-based coordinate system. Studies having a similar measure of rsFC were compiled together, followed by putting those results that had a change in one direction (either pre-ECT > post-ECT or post-ECT > pre-ECT) in one set for ALE analysis. The estimates thus obtained had the above-chance convergence of rsFC patterns, independently distributed, between common experiments\/studies in a random effects model. The resulting ALE maps and ALE score corresponding to the experiments studied were extracted. Multiple comparisons were performed accordingly, either at a statistical (  p   < 0.05; 1,000 permutations) threshold using a cluster-level familywise error rate (FWER) or at a statistical threshold of   p   < 0.05 (minimum volume threshold in mm  equal to the volume of the lowest cluster having significant difference) using the false discovery rate (FDR) as a correction measure. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search Results \n  \nThe flow diagram of the process depicting the literature search and study selection is shown in  . Among the 258 articles found in the literature search, 217 were excluded after reviewing the abstract, and another 10 were rejected after reviewing their full text. Their details and reasons for exclusion from the systematic review are shown in  . We identified a total of 31 articles to be included in the systematic review. Among them, 13 articles were considered for ALE analysis. One of them had 2 different samples (Bai et al.,  ), which were considered separately for meta-analysis. Contrary to it, there was one sample that was used for different kinds of neuroimaging analysis in different articles (Wang et al.,  ,  , ; Wang J. et al.,  ; Wang L. et al.,  ). We considered those articles to be separate entities as the different measures of rsFC were undertaken separately for meta-analysis. The studies reporting ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo as a measure of rsFC with the voxel-wise method of extracting image data were analyzed using ALE. All of them used FWER for correcting multiple comparisons. Further, ALE was conducted for 3 seed-based FC. Here, the 2 studies reporting right HC (R. HC) as seed were considered separately during ALE because one used FWER (Abbott et al.,  ) and the other used FDR (Takamiya et al.,  ) for handling multiple comparisons. Last, 2 studies reporting rsFC between the posterior DMN (constituting PCC and precuneus) and dmPFC using network-based analysis with FDR as the multiple comparisons correction method were included for ALE. The details of all these studies are presented in   with their measures that were included in ALE analysis as well as the excluded measures. The remaining 18 studies that were excluded completely from the meta-analysis are shown in   with all measures of rsFC used in these studies and reasons for their exclusion. The most common reason for the exclusion of studies was the absence of any other study using same measure or using same region of interest (ROI) for seed-\/network-based rsFC analysis. In addition, some other studies were also not included due to the unavailability of information regarding coordinates and cluster size needed to conduct ALE analysis. \n  \nFlow diagram of literature search and study selection. *Some of these studies are included in more than one rsFC measure for ALE analysis. aInsula (v), Ventral part of anterior insula; pDMN, posterior default mode network. \n    \nList of studies with their different measures of rsFC included in ALE analysis examining the effect of ECT in depression. \n  \n aDMN, anterior DMN; AMTN, Anteromedial Temporal network; mdTh, medio dorsal thalamus; OFN, Orbitofrontal network; pDMN, posterior DMN; SCC, Subcallosal cingulate cortex; SAL, Salience network; vBGN, ventral basal ganglia network; aTL, anterior Temporal lobe; GTN, Graph Theory and Network analysis; FcHo, Functional connectivity Homogeneity; FDR, False Discovery Rate; FWER, Family-wise Error Rate  . \n    \nList of studies with their different measures of rsFC excluded from ALE analysis examining the effect of ECT in depression and the reasons for exclusion. \n  \n ACC, Anterior Cingulate Cortex; OFC, Orbito Frontal Cortex; aDMN, anterior DMN; cm\/sfAmyg, centromedian\/superficial amygdala; midHC, middle hippocampus; supTG, superior temporal gyrus; vDMN, ventral DMN; VMHC, Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic Connectivity; VS, Ventral striatum; sgACC, subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex; gFCD, global Functional Connectivity Density; FDR, False Discovery Rate; FWER, Family-wise Error Rate  . \n  \n\n### ALE Results \n  \nA total of 73 foci were analyzed from 21 experiments through 10 sets of ALE analysis. Among the analysis exploring ECT-associated rsFC changes using FWER, one voxel-wise analysis with the measure of ALFF and one seed-voxel analysis with R. HC showed a significant reduction of rsFC (  p   < 0.0001) in the left cingulate gyrus (L. CG) in the area of L. dACC and a significant increase (  p   < 0.0001) in R. HC with right parahippocampal gyrus (R. PHG) using cluster-level interference method, respectively. Another combination of studies implementing network-based (posterior DMN- dmPFC) rsFC analysis using FDR as a multiple comparisons correction procedure showed a statistically significant increase (  p   < 0.001) in the left posterior cingulate cortex (L. PCC) and R. PCC using FDR. The results are presented in  , and images of significant clusters are shown in  . \n  \nALE results for studies using different measures of rsFC to study the effect of ECT in depression. \n  \n pre> post, Greater before the ECT course; post> pre, Greater after the ECT course\/specified number of ECT sessions  . \n    \nActivation likelihood estimate results for studies measuring   (A)   ALFF,   (B)   network connectivity and   (C)   seed (RHC) to voxels to study the effect of ECT on rsFC.

We did not rate the overall neuroimaging quality of a study. Instead, we highlighted the aspects by which the study lacked the relevant information or missed the concerned step of the neuroimaging process. These lacunae definitely bring down the quality of studies. \n\n#### Scanning Procedure \n    \nMost of the studies provided almost all relevant information about it although some did not document a few characteristics, such as orientation of image acquisition, matrix size, and the presence of interslice skip. \n  \nAlthough many articles provided the name of the software\/s used for preprocessing and further analysis of images, detail about the version was missing in most of them. \n  \n\n#### Image Preprocessing \n    \nThe information about the distortion correction related to the artifacts of the EPI sequence was available only in Leaver et al. ( ). In this study, artifacts retrieved through ICA were then used as regressors during denoising to get rid of them, an approach suggested for handling the distortions (Griffanti et al.,  ; Soares et al.,  ). None of the other papers reported this or any other method of correction, such as reversed phase encoding, field map correction, or point spread function (Hong et al.,  ; Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ; Nunes and Hajnal,  ). \n  \nAll studies except Argyelan et al. ( ) provided information about realignment parameters for head motion correction, but a description about transformation functions used during realignment was specified only in Abbott et al. ( ); Abbott et al. ( ). \n  \nOutlier detection was performed through framewise displacement (FD) in only 4 studies (Argyelan et al.,  ; Bai et al.,  ; Takamiya et al.,  ; Wang J. et al.,  ) with the threshold as 0.5 or 5 mm. Other studies did not give any account of outlier detection. \n  \nThe normalization of the functional images was indirect through the structural image and its associated template in 3 articles (Liu et al.,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). In other studies, the normalization was probably direct. The name of the template with or without further specification was provided by all except Bai et al. ( ). An EPI template was used only by Qiu et al. ( ), whereas others used a standard structural template. \n  \nFWHM for smoothing varied from 3.33 times the slice thickness (Abbott et al.,  ,  ) to <1.33 times (Qiu et al.,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Bai et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). They had smoothing with FWHM at 3 times (Leaver et al.,  ), 2.67 times (Qiu et al.,  ), 2 times (Argyelan et al.,  ), and 1.5 times (Wang J. et al.,  ; Wang L. et al.,  ). \n  \nSome of the recommended models\/measures for denoising were reported in few studies here. tCompCor was adopted by Abbott et al. ( ,  ) and aCompCor by Takamiya et al. ( ), and FD-related motion parameters were scrubbed by Takamiya et al. ( ) and Wang J. et al. ( ). Nonetheless, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and motion parameters from realignment were considered by all during linear regression for denoising along with the frequency band filtering. Leaver et al. ( ) did not use these parameters for denoising providing statistical justification, and Takamiya et al. ( ) did not provide information about the number of motion parameters used during denoising. No study recorded physiological parameters specifically to be used as regressors. The global brain signal was used as a regressor by Liu et al. ( ) and Zhang et al. ( ), whereas a few studies did not consider it (Abbott et al.,  ,  ; Argyelan et al.,  ; Bai et al.,  ; Wang J. et al.,  ; Wang L. et al.,  ). No study provided any information about detrending. There were two studies that did not have any information about denoising (Qiu et al.,  ,  ). \n  \n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStudies had a few shortfalls in this area compared with the standards required (Poldrack et al.,  ; Roiser et al.,  ). \n  \nAlthough most of them used FWER for handling multiple comparison issues, a few did not write about the model used to consider the cluster size and significance threshold for FWER (Abbott et al.,  ; Argyelan et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). \n  \nAmong the studies that used random field theory for FWER, none of them provided the information about resolution element (RESEL) count (Leaver et al.,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Bai et al.,  ). A RESEL is defined as a block of pixels of the same size as the FWHM of the smoothness of the image and is a crucial factor in the application of random field theory for FWER (Brett et al.,  ). \n  \nIn some studies, the difference between pre- and post-ECT rsfMRI was analyzed without adding any study sample-based characteristic as a covariate (Liu et al.,  ; Argyelan et al.,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Wang J. et al.,  ; Wang L. et al.,  ). \n  \nThe correlation of ECT-associated rsFC with the clinical characteristics was carried out in most of the studies as a   post hoc   analysis of the significant results without any correction for multiple comparisons. In one study only, we found the percentage change in depression scores during the course of ECT to be incorporated as between-subjects contrast in the primary model of analysis of significant change in seed-based rsFC (Takamiya et al.,  ). \n  \nThe display of the results in tabular format was mostly as per the standards in all the studies included for meta-analysis although some had a deficiency in a few aspects in their figures, such as absence of thresholds,   t-  scores, naming, and coordinate details of significant regions. In addition, there were some studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis due to unavailability of all required parameters of the significant results. \n  \n\n\n### Articles Included for Systematic Review: Clinical and ECT Characteristics \n  \n#### Articles Included in Meta-Analysis: Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe clinical characteristics were reported adequately by all studies. Among the 13 studies ( ) included in the meta-analysis, the sample size was limited to 12\u201330 subjects except for one study by Zhang et al. ( ) with 45 subjects. Half of these studies had patients with unipolar depression only, whereas the rest included subjects with bipolar depression as well. Three studies focused only on patients having treatment-resistant depression (Abbott et al.,  ; Argyelan et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ), and four had older adults only as their participants (Abbott et al.,  ,  ; Kong et al.,  ; Takamiya et al.,  ). Except for a few (Argyelan et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ,  ), patients in all studies had pharmacotherapy concurrently during the course of ECT. \n  \nList of studies included in ALE analysis: clinical characteristics. \n  \n AD, Antidepressants; AMHU, Anhui Mental Health Center as Study site; AP, Antipsychotics; BPD, Bipolar depression; BT, Bitemporal; HAM-D, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; MS, Mood Stabilizer; NA, Information Not Available; NaSSA, Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants; SARI, Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor; S. Ch, Succinylcholine; SD, Standard Deviation; SNRI, Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; UPD, Unipolar depression; USTC, University of Science and Technology of China as Study site  . \n  \n\n#### Articles Excluded From Meta-Analysis: Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe clinical characteristics of the 18 articles that were excluded from meta-analysis were partially similar to those of articles included in the meta-analysis. Among these studies ( ), all had a sample size of <30 subjects except for 3 studies with sample sizes of 45 (Bai et al.,  ), 118 (Qi et al.,  ), and 122 (Sun et al.,  ), respectively. Ten of them recruited patients with unipolar depression only, and six of them solely focused on treatment-resistant depression. However, none of these studies specifically studied the geriatric population. \n\n\n#### Articles Included for Systematic Review: ECT Characteristics \n  \nThe treatment aspects related to ECT are presented here together for the articles included in the meta-analysis and those excluded. The details about ECT were provided sufficiently in most of the 31 articles for systematic review. However, the ratio of the administered electrical charge to the seizure threshold is mentioned only in some studies. This information is important as the electrical stimulus dosing influences the rate of improvement and total response in depressive symptoms with ECT (Murugesan,  ). A few studies also fail to provide anesthetic medications details. An almost equal number of studies used bifrontal (BF), bitemporal (BT), and right unilateral (RUL) as electrode placements during ECT. Some had provision to switch to BT (Leaver et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Sun et al.,  ) or BF (Leaver et al.,  ) if RUL did not provide significant improvement. Except for Leaver et al. ( ) (ultra-brief pulse-wave ECT), all studies used brief pulse-wave ECT. Most of them had conducted post-ECT neuroimaging after the last session of ECT except in some studies, in which it was done after a predetermined number of ECT sessions (Liu et al.,  ; Cano et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ,  ; Li et al.,  ; Sinha et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Articles Included for Systematic Review: Neuroimaging Findings \n  \nHere, we briefly present the resting state neuroimaging findings of all 31 articles that studied ECT-associated changes in rsFC in the depressed patient group. The detailed findings are shown in  . Among studies based on the voxel-wise method of data analysis, CG was often noted as a significant region to be associated with ECT. Although the ACC (L > R) is a more common region of the CG to show a significant change in rsFC after ECT, the concurrence was low for the specific part of the ACC. The other regions that had significant findings post-ECT in voxel-wise analysis of rsFC belonged to the frontal cortex and parietal cortex as well as the temporal cortex. It included dmPFC, bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left precuneus, bilateral HC, right superior temporal gyrus, and right insula. In addition, the cerebellum (L > R) in a few studies showed significant change in rsFC with ECT. \n\nIn seed-based analysis, rsFC of the sgACC\/subcallosal cingulate cortex with ipsilateral PHG and contralateral temporal pole significantly changed with ECT in two studies but had contrast in the direction of change (Liu et al.,  ; Argyelan et al.,  ). Superficial amygdala was used in two studies for seed-based rsFC analysis. One study found a significant decrease in rsFC post-ECT between the centromedial\/superficial amygdala and sgACC on the right side (Cano et al.,  ) although the other study noted an increase in rsFC of the superficial amygdala with a fusiform area on the left side (Wang et al.,  ). In network-based and ROI (with rsFC) to ROI analysis, ACC, PCC, different regions of DMN (PCC, precuneus, medial PFC, intraparietal sulcus), and left cerebellum more often had prominent changes in rsFC with ECT. In the study that jointly analyzed structural MRI and rsfMRI images using HAM-D scores as a reference, FC in PFC, HC, insula, and left caudate were found to be reduced after ECT (Qi et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdvancement in neuroimaging in the last 20 years has been seen as a hope to reduce the enigma associated with mechanisms of actions of ECT. Structural neuroimaging shows stronger evidence of change in the brain with ECT compared with other treatments for depression (Enneking et al.,  ). We focus on CBMA of rsfMRI-based studies conducted on patients receiving ECT for treating depression. A meta-analytic approach helped us to achieve reliable and strong results instead of a gamut of less reproducible findings of the individual studies. We conducted ALE analysis on 7 measures of rsFC, including ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo for the voxel-wise, ventral part of the anterior insula, dmPFC and R. HC as seed-based and pDMN-dmPFC as network-based data extraction methods from the rsfMRI data. \n\n### Findings of Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review \n  \nThe significant regions in our meta-analysis were associated with cingulate gyrus (L > R) and included the dorsal part of the ACC (Left), BA 32, and PCC (bilateral), BA 31. There was a reduction in rsFC of the L. dACC after the course of ECT. Neuroimaging studies suggest increased activity in the ACC as an important biomarker for depression (Helm et al.,  ; Lai,  ), which normalizes after treatment with antidepressants and serves as a predictor for the response (Arnone,  ; Dunlop et al.,  ; Tian et al.,  ). However, sgACC\/rACC are implicated here more often than dACC. Studies exploring dACC found increased FC of dACC within the frontocingular network during emotional\/cognitive control\u2013related tasks in patients with depression (Schl\u00f6sser et al.,  ), which also predicts response to both antidepressants (Crane et al.,  ; Godlewska et al.,  ) and psychotherapy (Beevers et al.,  ; Fonseka et al.,  ). Although Fu et al. ( ) found a decrease in FC of dACC with fluoxetine during the task of \u201csadness\u201d recognition, most of the other studies on rsFC or task-based FC failed to observe a change in FC of dACC with the treatment of depression through either antidepressants or psychotherapy. Thus, the effect on the dACC in patients having depression, as noted in our meta-analysis, may be a specific mechanism of action of ECT. The dACC is implicated in the salience network along with the anterior insula (Seeley et al.,  ; Enneking et al.,  ). In fact, the dACC is being considered as a part of the neural alarm system and seems to be involved in both detecting performance in a cognitive task and social behavior as well as providing a negative affect to, thus, perceive errors and social rejection, respectively (Spunt et al.,  ). The exaggerated pattern of this aspect is associated with depression (Slavich et al.,  ; Kupferberg et al.,  ). \n\nIn our pDMN- and dmPFC-related network analysis, we found increased rsFC of PCC by the end of the ECT course. PCC is considered to be an important part of pDMN and is found to have increased FC with dmPFC in people having depression compared with controls (Mulders et al.,  ; Helm et al.,  ). Increased rsFC of PCC has been shown to be a predictor for response to antidepressants (Goldstein-Piekarski et al.,  ; Dunlop et al.,  ), psychotherapy (Dunlop et al.,  ), and ECT (van Waarde et al.,  ). Although there is evidence of reduction in FC of PCC with antidepressants in response to a negative emotional task in some studies, the evidence is limited in rsFC studies to overall increased activity in pDMN rather than in PCC specifically (Arnone,  ; Ichikawa et al.,  ). An increase in glucose metabolism in PCC in unipolar depressed patients receiving fluoxetine was, however, noted in an earlier PET study (Mayberg et al.,  ). The possible reasons for the difference in brain regions affected by ECT and antidepressants may be related to their duration of action. The reduction in depressive symptoms achieved by the antidepressants is not by their direct pharmacological actions but through the brain's compensatory responses to those actions, hence, needing a longer time for the clinical improvement with antidepressants (Schatzberg and DeBattista,  ). Considering that response to ECT is faster, its mechanism of action might be different from that of antidepressants. \n\nThe link of global atrophy of HC to the pathology of depression is reasonably recognized, and so is the improvement in its size and associated neurogenesis with antidepressants and other treatment for depression (Helm et al.,  ; Santos et al.,  ; Lai,  ; Price and Duman,  ). However, the knowledge about FC of HC during the depressive episode and post response to antidepressants or ECT is ambiguous (Fonseka et al.,  ; Dunlop et al.,  ). Hence, our result of increased FC between R. HC and R. PHG after a course of ECT is valuable. HC is considered to be part of the limbic system with PHG and amygdala and is involved in emotional perception, forming an integral part of the frontolimbic network (Yeo et al.,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ). Our result is based on a single-study ALE analysis using FWER; ALE analysis with multiple studies is definitely needed to confirm this finding and to examine the connectivity of HC of each hemisphere with prefrontal areas. There is also a need for a greater number of studies to evaluate the effect of ECT on other important areas that were noted during systematically reviewing existing studies. These possible regions include sgACC, dlPFC, precuneus, precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior insula. \n\n\n### Strengths of Our Meta-Analytic Approach \n  \nWe analyzed the studies with different rsFC measures\/extraction methods of rsfMRI separately for CBMA as recommended (Zhang et al.,  ). In fact, the studies having different seed regions in seed-voxel or RSN analysis were also analyzed separately. Combining seed-based connectivity studies with different seeds can be a problem because it represents selection bias at the time of choosing seeds and, hence, is not recommended (Cortese et al.,  ). This approach is distinct from that considered by earlier studies using gingerALE based meta-analysis, in which they had combined results of different kinds of neuroimaging (Chen et al.,  ; Disner et al.,  ; Mothersill and Donohoe,  ), different approaches to fMRI (resting state and task based) (Ayoub et al.,  ), different extraction methods and measures for rsFC (Disner et al.,  ; Gu and Zhang,  ; Lau et al.,  ), and different seed regions and networks (Lau et al.,  ; Ramsay,  ; Xu et al.,  ). We also analyzed the studies separately that derived results using FDR and that using FWER as these statistical methods of correcting for multiple comparisons are fundamentally distinguished and need different handling during ALE analysis (Roiser et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). Our results can be trusted with a greater degree of confidence considering that our   p   < 0.0001. Because foci with only the same direction of change was considered together in our analysis, our results could indicate significant regions with precision and the associated direction of effects with ECT unlike other neuroimaging meta-analyses using the ALE method (Mothersill and Donohoe,  ; Gray et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Limitations of the Studies Included in Meta-Analysis \n  \n#### Limitations in Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe most important limitation of the studies included in the meta-analysis is their small sample size. Half of the studies had a sample size fewer than 20, and the remainder of the studies except one (Wang L. et al.,  ) had sizes within 30. Small sample-sized studies have limited power and are more likely to miss the regions with significant FC or else to get spurious results if less stringent cutoff   p   value or lower voxel\/cluster thresholds are used (Carter et al.,  ). The clinical population varied across the studies with inclusion of different categories of depression (unipolar vs. bipolar, with or without psychotic symptoms, presence of treatment resistance), age groups of both young and older adults, and varied status of pharmacotherapy. Studies also varied with the electrode placement used for administering ECT. All this variability in clinical and treatment characteristics might have added to the disparity in study findings and, hence, to the insignificant results in ALE analysis. \n\n\n#### Limitations in Neuroimaging Characteristics \n  \nIn addition, there were differences in acquisition and analysis of neuroimaging in the included studies. Because there is no scale\/instrument available that rates the neuroimaging aspects of studies, many meta-analysis-based papers either had not commented on the quality of neuroimaging (Disner et al.,  ; Gu and Zhang,  ; Ramsay,  ) or did partly (Chen et al.,  ; Ayoub et al.,  ; Xu et al.,  ). We reviewed in detail the procedure, preprocessing, and analysis of neuroimaging; their documentation; and the reporting style of the results presented in the studies to assess the quality and understand the variability. Many features in the included studies were present as per the recommendations and opinions of experts (Poldrack et al.,  ; Weber et al.,  ; Soares et al.,  ), yet they had a few important omissions. Along with flip angle during scanning, the slice thickness varied; both would affect the image intensity. A few recommended steps of preprocessing were missing in many studies, thus reducing the validity of the respective neuroimaging study findings. These included a specific distortion correction method for scanner-related artifacts, outlier detection through DVARS (the temporal derivative of time courses for FC variance over voxels)\/FD for further motion correction, and denoising with extensive variables and scrubbing using appropriate functions (aCompCor, ICA based) (Behzadi et al.,  ; Poldrack et al.,  ; Power et al.,  ; Griffanti et al.,  ; Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds,  ). We could not ascertain whether the unreported steps were carried out as many studies did not provide the version of software used for neuroimage preprocessing and analysis. The inadequate information provided about FWER in some studies further casts a concern about the accuracy of their results (Poldrack et al.,  ; Weber et al.,  ; Soares et al.,  ). Last, most of the studies correlated results with depressive symptoms as   post hoc   analysis, which increases the type-1 error (Vul et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Limitations of Our Meta-Analytic Approach \n  \nOur study has few limitations as well. CBMA applied in our study has disadvantages, including less consistency and reliability of findings and less flexibility than IBMA, which relies on statistical parametric maps of raw images of the included studies (Salimi-Khorshidi et al.,  ). In addition, the role of the different demographic and clinical characteristics of study samples as covariates in explaining the significant results is still in its nascent phase in CBMA (Tench et al.,  ). This came as an important drawback for our analysis as we had significant heterogeneity in the included studies. However, using CBMA enabled us to include more studies than what was possible with image-based meta-analysis. \n\nAmong the available kernel-based techniques of CBMA [multilevel kernel density analysis, ALE, and signed differential mapping (SDM)], ALE is the most widely used and popular method (The BrainMap Project,  ). With recent updates, ALE addresses the limitations cited with respect to multilevel kernel density analysis (Wager et al.,  ). The newer version of SDM as a seed-based d mapping permutation of subject imaging (SDM-PSI) is able to provide a good estimate of effect size of voxel clusters with a significant change in activity if the peak coordinates and   t  -values are reported (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). Unfortunately, many studies do not report   t-  values or associated   z  -values, and SDM-PSI is less sensitive and has more uncertainty than anisotropic effect-size seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM) (Radua et al.,  ). Other limitations exist with SDM-PSI, some of which are related to the principle of CBMA. These include the handling of studies using multiple comparisons, the presence of a fewer number of studies, and focusing on correlation among only those voxels that are completely in line with each other rather than partly. A recent meta-analysis of task-based fMRI for language comprehension in children found the same brain regions of significant activation peaks with both ALE and SDM-PSI (Enge et al.,  ). We applied the ALE as recommended and avoided mixing of the studies with differences in neuroimaging techniques and analysis (Zang et al.,  ). \n\nWe did not explore the data using model-based methods, such as the Bayesian hierarchical cluster process model, which could have provided more accurate spatial results (Kang et al.,  ). We hope that our results and future studies would lead to model-based CBMA of rsFC in ECT with a valid a priori assumption (Samartsidis et al.,  ). We also had to exclude studies using GTN due to restriction in ALE analysis. With these results, we also did not comment on either the neuroimaging predictors of improvement in depression with ECT or on the association of regions with significant change in rsFC with cognitive deficits developed after ECT. These aims need to be explored in separate meta-analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion and Future Directions \n  \nThis meta-analysis aimed to understand the mechanisms of action of ECT in patients having depression. We focus on different measures of rsFC used in this group of patients and find those regions of cingulate gyrus showing a significant change with ECT, which has not changed often with other treatments for depression in earlier studies. These include reduction in rsFC in L. dACC and increase in rsFC of bilateral PCC. They are also noted in the literature as important predictors of improvement in depression with different treatments. In addition, we find increased rsFC in R. HC and R. PHG. Thus, our meta-analysis supports the argument of distinct mechanisms of action of ECT. The constraint in sample size and limitations in different aspects of neuroimaging of the studies included for this meta-analysis need to be addressed in future neuroimaging studies of ECT in depression. We also recommend the use of these regions to explore seed-based rsFC and to apply common measures of rsFC as rsfMRI studies in ECT are still in their early phase. Nonetheless, dynamic FC and GTN can be explored further on the rsfMRI data for studying the effect of ECT. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nHJ did the ALE analysis and prepared figure and table related to ALE analysis.

However, it remains unclear whether single-brain studies are informative about cooperation in real life, where people interact dynamically. Such dynamic interactions have become the focus of interbrain studies. An advantageous technique in this regard is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because it is less susceptible to movement artifacts than more conventional techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We conducted a systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 human participants. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed evidence of statistically significant interbrain synchrony while people were cooperating, with large overall effect sizes in both frontal and temporoparietal areas. All thirteen studies observed significant interbrain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The consistency in these findings is unlikely to be because of task-related activations, given that the relevant studies used diverse cooperation tasks. Together, the present findings support the importance of interbrain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. Moreover, the present article highlights the usefulness of meta-analyses as a tool for discerning patterns in interbrain dynamics. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Significance Statement \n  \nWe present systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 participants. All thirteen studies observed significant interbrain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The present findings support the importance of interbrain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. \n\n\n## Introduction \n  \nHuman beings cooperate on small scales, like friends or families, and on larger scales, like nation states ( ;  ). Nevertheless, there are many cases where cooperation fails, from marital arguments to political conflicts, leading to suboptimal outcomes for individuals and society. To understand the complexities of cooperation and help people realize more of their cooperative potential, it is helpful to obtain a better scientific understanding of cooperation. \n\nOne key scientific question is how cooperation is implemented in the brain. Over the last three decades, a large literature has emerged on social neuroscience ( ;  ;  ). Much of this research to date has relied on a single-brain approach as the dominant paradigm in contemporary neuroscience. In a typical social neuroscience study, a participant views social stimuli on a computer screen while her or his neural activations are being recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A number of neural systems have been implicated in social cognition more generally, including the mirror neuron system and the mentalizing system. The former purportedly consists of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior frontal lobule (IFL), and superior temporal gyrus (STG). The latter involves the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC;  ;  ). \n\nOne limitation of traditional social neuroscience research is that participants are not directly engaged in social interaction. To overcome this problem, researchers have moved toward a truly social, second-person neuroscience approach ( ;  ). In second-person neuroscience, neural processes are examined within the context of a real-time reciprocal social interaction. Preliminary evidence has confirmed the added value of the second-person neuroscience approach by showing that specific neural signatures are only observable during \u201ctrue\u201d social interaction ( ). \n\nRecent developments in neuroimaging have enabled so-called \u201chyperscanning,\u201d whereby the activity of two or more brains can be assessed simultaneously while people are interacting ( ;  ). The resulting interbrain activity is usually characterized in terms of the synchronization of the functional activity of the interacting brains. Hyperscanning has used a variety of neural imaging procedures, including EEG ( ), magnetoencephalography (MEG; ), fMRI ( ), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS;  ). Each apparatus and method has different advantages and disadvantages for hyperscanning ( ;  ). Hyperscanning research paradigms vary from studying coordinated finger movements ( ), to real-life situations like playing guitar in a duet ( ) or studying multiple brains of high-school students inside the classroom ( ). \n\nSo far, hyperscanning studies have revealed that interbrain synchrony plays a crucial role in joint attention, interpersonal communication and coordination, cooperation, and decision-making (for review, see  ). Many hyperscanning studies have used spoken language during interactions between participants ( ;  ;  ), ranging from knowledge sharing, cooperation, turn-taking, and naturalistic situations. Of the latter studies, many reported the emergence of interbrain synchrony during interpersonal communication based on cooperative interaction in frontal and temporoparietal regions. \n\nWhile the field is still young ( ), we conducted a meta-analysis ( ) of fNIRS hyperscanning studies focusing on cooperative behavior. The present review focused explicitly on fNIRS studies for a number of reasons. The method of fNIRS is one of the most commonly used neuroimaging techniques in hyperscanning studies of cooperation ( ), which is relatively insensitive to motion artifacts and capable of capturing interbrain synchrony over longer periods (from seconds to minutes). \n\nFor example, social communication enhanced interbrain synchrony during a turn-taking game ( ). These and related findings suggest that interbrain synchrony in frontal regions is associated with successful knowledge sharing and cooperative behavior using spoken language. Studies have additionally reported higher interbrain synchrony in temporoparietal regions during teacher-student interactions ( ;  ), cooperation ( ;  ), and naturalistic discussion ( ). \n\nIn sum, many hyperscanning studies have examined the interbrain dynamics associated with cooperative behavior. The findings appear to show some convergence, with interbrain synchrony seemingly emerging in frontal regions. However, without quantitative integration through meta-analysis, it is not possible to determine the degree to which hyperscanning studies of cooperation have converging results. This question is of substantive theoretical interest, given the diverse paradigms used in hyperscanning studies in this area. More specifically, the cooperation tasks used varied considerably across studies, ranging from singing together to jointly solving a puzzle. This means that these tasks, aside from their cooperative nature, are unlikely to evoke shared neural activations based on low-level operational features. Thus, finding a common neuroanatomical site for interbrain synchrony in these studies would provide relatively strong evidence for a general-purpose neural substrate for cooperative behavior. Our work had two aims: (1) to review the relevant literature and (2) to assess consistency in findings of interbrain synchrony in different brain regions related to cooperative behavior. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search strategy and inclusion criteria \n  \nWe searched MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases for fNIRS hyperscanning studies of cooperation in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines (PRISMA;  ). Following consultation with a librarian, two authors independently conducted searches in September 2021 using keywords: ((hyperscanning OR \u201csocial neuroscience\u201d OR fnirs) AND (interbrain OR interbrain OR interpersonal OR interneural OR interneural OR synchron* OR coupling OR alignment OR \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d) AND (cooperat* OR collaborat*)). Inclusion criteria included: fNIRS hyperscanning; cooperation\/collaboration (where participants interacted to achieve a specific outcome such as solve a problem or puzzle or accomplish a particular result, thereby excluding turn-taking activities such as sequential counting, ultimatum game, prisoner dilemma and word games). Additionally, we excluded studies that focused on comparisons between genders, different levels of cooperation and did not report comparisons between cooperation and other conditions (cooperation or independent) or baseline. Discrepancies relating to inclusion were resolved through mutual discussion ( ). \n  \nFlowchart of selection process. \n  \n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nBecause functional equivalence was not expected to hold across the included studies, and a common effect size could not be assumed, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis ( ). We set the threshold for Type I errors (\u03b1) at 0.05 and used effect sizes provided in the selected articles (if reported). We used the Psychometrica website ( ) to estimate Cohen\u2019s   d   from \u03b7  (if available in the article), or we estimated Cohen\u2019s   d   based on information provided in the article (statistical results;  ). Further, we transformed effect sizes to Hedges\u2019   g  ; although similar to the classical Cohen\u2019s   d  , it controls potential biases in studies with small sample sizes. If more than one comparison between cooperation and other conditions was present in the article, we chose the most orthogonal comparison. Furthermore, if more than one channel per region was reported, we selected the most central channel to the reported brain region. The heterogeneity across studies was gauged by Cochrane\u2019s   Q  ,   I  ,   \u03c4   statistics, and forest plots. We used Cochrane\u2019s   Q   as a statistical test of the null-hypothesis of no heterogeneity,   I   to quantitatively estimate the variance between studies, and forest plots to visualize all effect sizes. In addition, we used funnel plots to assess publication bias. Publication bias concerns the elevated probability of studies reporting positive results being published. The tendency of journals to give preference to research showing positive findings means negative results may remain unpublished, leading to bias and an increased likelihood of false-positive outcomes ( ). Using Egger\u2019s tests, we tested the funnel plot for symmetry and adjusted effect sizes with trim and fill analysis ( ). Furthermore, we performed meta-regression analysis to test the influence of the variables Age, Gender and Language, type of communication on overall effect sizes. All statistics were computed using the open-source JASP statistical computing environment ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe first present the results of the literature review and afterward the results of the meta-analysis of thirteen selected papers. \n\n### Selected studies \n  \nThe search resulted in selecting thirteen studies over the period 2016\u20132021, with an initial total of 888 participants and 847 once unusable data were removed (see  ). Nine studies were conducted in China, one in Japan, and three were performed in the United States. Seven studies used verbal communication between acting participants during the investigation, while six studies did not. HbO measures were used because of increased sensitivity to blood flow, with preprocessing including low-pass filtering and global detrending. Eleven of the studies employed wavelet transform coherence (WTC;  ) to convert the signal for interbrain synchrony analysis, and two studies used correlation-based measures to estimate interbrain synchrony. \n  \nSelected studies \n    \n\n### Experimental designs \n  \nThe conditions under which interbrain synchrony occurred depended on the experimental setup. Cooperative behavior is often studied with the use of games. Our search found three studies that used Jenga or Tangram puzzles to investigate interbrain synchrony (Jenga,  ;  ; Tangram,  ). In the case of the Jenga game, these studies compared cooperative and competitive modes of building a tower, while solving a tangram puzzle was compared between together and apart conditions. On the one hand, multiple studies used different types of problem-solving tasks to study interbrain synchrony. A set of studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) used realistically presented problem, where cooperation was facilitated by feedback and compared with situations where no feedback was provided. These studies used the presence of a third person (confederate) to create cooperative (feedback) and non-cooperative situations (no-feedback). This task closely resembles many everyday situations in which we solve problems together with the people surrounding us. They require communication and creativity; therefore, they are suitable for studying neural underpinnings of social interactions (interbrain synchrony). \n\n) used a creativity task in cooperative and competitive contexts. Participants in this study had to solve problems that required divergent thinking. Another aspect of cooperation was studied with a math problem task by   by comparing cooperative with independent situations between a teacher and student (both adults). On the other hand, tasks that cooperatively require synchronization of behavior were selected. Two studies investigated synchronized taps between participants. In one of them, participants tried to synchronize their taps (cooperation) or be faster than the co-actor (competition;  ), while in the other study, bidirectional and unidirectional tapping was compared ( ). Lastly, one study compared interbrain synchrony in joint (synchronized) versus independent drawing ( ). In sum, various types of tasks were found to study cooperation and interbrain synchrony with fNIRS. This suggests that many different cognitive functions were studied, and different brain regions were involved. \n\n\n### Brain regions \n  \nThe results of the studies we reviewed showed interbrain synchrony in different parts of the brain. Studies reported parts of frontal and temporoparietal regions as sources of synchronization ( ). \n  \nInterbrain synchrony in different parts of the prefrontal and temporoparietal cortex in various tasks used to study cooperation. \n  \n\n### PFC \n  \nAll studies report different subregions of PFC to elicit more robust interbrain synchrony in cooperative situations than the other conditions. Interestingly, different subparts of PFC were reported to be synchronized in different tasks. One set of studies (six studies,  ;  ;  , ;  ;  ) that required flexibility in solving a problem (realistic, creativity, and math problems) or drawing together show interbrain synchrony in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). One of the primary functions of DLPFC reported in intra brain studies is cognitive flexibility related to attention switch ( ). \n\nCollaborative problem-solving tasks require focus switches between co-actors and the problem to solve, and interbrain synchrony in DLPFC may underpin these flexible attentional switches. Different subregions of PFC, IFG\/MFG, show interbrain synchrony during gamified tasks, like cooperative Jenga, tangram puzzle, and cooperative singing (four studies,  ;  ;  ;  ). These regions are involved in language processing, and interbrain synchronization may facilitate cooperative behavior in tasks requiring a lot of verbal communication to solve (Jenga (with verbal communication) and Tangram puzzle;  ;  ). However, interbrain synchronization in IFG\/MFG was also reported in cooperative Jenga play without verbal communication ( ). Further research is needed to resolve the role of verbal communication in the Jenga task. One could compare cooperative Jenga play with and without verbal communication to gain more insight into the function of interbrain synchrony in IFG\/MFG. \n\nAnother subpart of PFC that shows interbrain synchrony is SFG (superior frontal gyrus). We identified one experiment that showed higher interbrain synchrony for cooperative joint tap when compared with competitive ( ). Lastly, we found that FPC (frontopolar cortex) also shows interbrain synchrony during cooperative realistic problem solving, suggesting that it is not only PFC that shows interbrain synchrony. Taken together, we found that most of the studies show interbrain synchrony in PFC, and that tasks requiring different cognitive functions elicit interbrain synchrony in different subparts of PFC. \n\n\n### Temporoparietal regions \n  \nFour of the included studies show interbrain synchrony in temporoparietal regions. It is important to note that these four studies are not different studies from the studies discussed above, but they show interbrain synchrony in temporoparietal regions in addition to PFC. Three out of four show interbrain synchrony in the TPJ while participants solve realistic or creativity problems ( ;  ;  ). TPJ is involved in many different tasks that require the theory of mind ( ), which is essential for successful interpersonal interactions as cooperative problem solving ( ). Therefore, the results of selected studies extend past research by showing interbrain synchrony in TPJ. Furthermore, these studies show interbrain synchrony in both frontal and temporoparietal regions, suggesting the existence of a PFC-TPJ interbrain network that facilitates cooperative behaviors. However, more evidence (studies) is required to test that interpretation. In addition to the PFC-TPJ connection, we identified one study that links PFC (IFG\/MFG) with the temporal lobe (IT and MTG; inferior temporal cortex, middle temporal gyrus) during cooperative singing ( ). \n\nTaken together, the selected studies pointed in the direction that interbrain synchrony in prefrontal and temporoparietal regions plays a crucial role in cooperation. To test that further, we performed a meta-analysis of the selected studies. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nA random-effects model for all 21 experimental conditions across the thirteen studies reported a significantly large overall effect size (  g\u2009  =  \u2009  1.98, 95% CI [1.47, 2.49],   n  \u2009=\u200921,   z\u2009  =  \u2009  7.68,   p\u2009  <  \u2009  0.001). Cochran\u2019s   Q   statistic (  Q  \u2009= 469.72,   p\u2009  <  \u2009  0.001) showed significant variation around the weighted average effect for the studies included. The proportion of observed variance was significantly high at   I  = 98.6 (>75 representing large heterogeneity), and a scaled measure of dispersion between true effect sizes of the studies was \u03c4  = 1.29 ( ). These results suggest that the selected studies had an overall large effect size for comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative conditions. Furthermore, the variance between studies was high, suggesting that nearly all variance between studies was not because of chance. Visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger\u2019s test (  z  \u2009=\u20097.22,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) indicated significant asymmetry. However, a follow-up trim and fill analysis resulted in the same effect size and confidence intervals (  g  \u2009=\u20091.98, 95% CI [1.47, 2.49];  ). \n  \nForest plot of all included studies. Boxes represent effect sizes and whiskers confidence intervals. \n  \nWe performed meta-regression examinations to test whether any independent variables (age, gender, language, type of communication) affected our analysis. Wald tests demonstrated no significant association between observed interbrain synchrony and independent variables overall. Chinese was used as the reference language. We found that age (\u03b2  \u2009  =  \u2009  0.12, SE = 0.27,   z\u2009  =  \u2009  0.43,   p\u2009  =  \u2009  0.66), gender (\u03b2 = \u22120.78, SE = 2.45,   z   = \u22120.32,   p\u2009  = 0.75), communication (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.78, SE = 1.4,   z\u2009  =  \u2009  0.56,   p\u2009  = 0.58), and language (English; \u03b2  \u2009  =  \u2009  0.12, SE = 0.95,   z\u2009  =  \u2009  0.12,   p\u2009  =  \u2009  0.9 and Japanese; \u03b2  \u2009  =  \u2009  0.29, SE = 0.92,   z\u2009  =  \u2009  0.3,   p\u2009  =  \u2009  0.77), all displayed insignificant results. The results of meta-regression analysis suggest that age, gender, type of communication, and language differences did not modulate overall effect sizes for the included studies. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWhen people cooperate, their neural activity will tend to become mutually synchronized. This interbrain synchrony during cooperation tasks has become the focus of a growing number of hyperscanning studies. In the present article, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning studies of cooperation. We located thirteen relevant studies with a total of 890 participants. The results of our meta-analysis revealed significant overall effect sizes for interbrain synchrony in both frontal and temporoparietal regions. All studies observed significant interbrain synchrony in the PFC. This consistency is remarkable, considering that the included studies used various cooperation tasks, such as realistic problem solving, joint drawing, and the Jenga puzzle. It thus appears that PFC has general relevance for cooperative behavior that cannot be reduced to task-specific elements. \n\nThe findings of the present meta-analysis are broadly consistent with the findings of previous single-brain studies implicating prefrontal regions in tasks requiring social interaction, coordination, and cooperation ( ). The present findings not only confirm these earlier findings from single-brain recordings but show that they are part of a broader pattern indicating that prefrontal regions are not just activated within individual brains operating separately from another. Instead, prefrontal regions are mutually activated in a synchronized fashion in the brains of interaction partners, becoming coupled in their functioning. Hyperscanning studies thus complement and extend traditional social neuroscience studies that were conducted within the single-brain paradigm. \n\nThe present work has limitations. First, the present meta-analysis included a relatively low number of studies. The studies had a relatively high number of participants, which affords better statistical power. Still, the limited number of studies makes it hard to estimate the effects of between-study characteristics. Second, the present meta-analysis was restricted to a single neuroimaging method, fNIRS, which has limited spatial resolution. In the same line, the placement of recording channels is not standardized; therefore, it is difficult to compare different studies. It hence remains essential to compare the present findings to other neuroimaging methods, like fMRI. Third, the meta-analysis revealed a high variance between studies that cannot be explained by chance. More work is needed to understand the sources of this variance, which is likely because of the large variety of conditions used in different studies. Fourth and last, the present meta-analysis may be contaminated by reporting bias, given that published studies tend to report only statistically significant comparisons of neural recordings. It is important to note that the last limitation is not a limitation per se of our work but a more general limitation of many neuroimaging studies that the field should address. We propose that non-significant channels\/comparisons should be reported in supplementary materials with all statistics values. It will allow for collecting more evidence and improve future meta-analyses. Additionally, this problem may be overcome in future work by creating better infrastructures for data sharing and open science practices ( ). \n\nIn conclusion, human beings are a cooperative species. The present research uncovered some of the neural foundations of this human ability to cooperate by conducting the first systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperative behavior. The results showed that cooperation is consistently associated with interbrain synchrony in frontal and temporoparietal areas, suggesting that interbrain neural alignment in these regions underlies cooperative behavior in humans. These findings underscore the importance of meta-analyses in detecting patterns across studies and elucidating the neural basis of semi-naturalistic cooperative behavior. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9014979,"text_md5":"b3e1a9170b81b822bab20533db465266","field_positions":{"authors":[0,138],"journal":[139,145],"publication_year":[147,151],"title":[162,325],"keywords":[339,392],"abstract":[405,2003],"body":[2012,24749]},"batch":2,"pmid":35365502,"doi":"10.1523\/ENEURO.0268-21.2022","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9014979","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9014979"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9014979\">9014979<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9014979  Cooperative Behavior Evokes Interbrain Synchrony in the Prefrontal and Temporoparietal Cortex: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies"}

Nonetheless, these findings are heterogeneous and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Thus, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis that identified consistent results of existing resting-state fMRI studies to determine concordant resting-state neural brain activity alterations in T2DM patients. A systematic search was conducted for resting-state fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. Coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences. The meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method, and nine studies were included. This meta-analysis identified robustly reduced resting-state brain activity in the whole brain of T2DM patients, including the bilateral lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The present study demonstrates a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain anomalies that will contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common metabolic disorder that currently affects approximately 415 million people worldwide, and the prevalence is increasing (International Diabetes Federation,  ). Patients with T2DM have an increased risk of dementia (Koekkoek et al.,  ), but the neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM-related cognitive impairment are not entirely clear. In addition to studies that only rely on neuropsychological performance and experiments based on molecular biology, neuroimaging techniques provide important clues about brain structure, function and metabolism for documenting neurological involvement in T2DM. \n\nBecause resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is noninvasive and task-free, it has been widely used to investigate the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified the subtle brain changes located in widespread cortical and subcortical regions that are observed in T2DM patients, but these studies have reported relatively inconsistent results. For instance, several researchers observed reduced neural activity in the cerebellum of T2DM patients (Wang et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ). In contrast, another study found increased activity in this region (Xia et al.,  ). Furthermore, only one study showed diminished activity in the precentral gyrus (Zhou et al.,  ). These reported discrepancies can potentially be attributed to the limited sample size, variable clinical demographics and use of different methods across studies. Thus, an urgent need exists for a meta-analysis to provide concordant results concerning the role of resting-state anomalies as common markers in T2DM patients. \n\nAs a coordinate-based meta-analytic method for meta-analyses of neuroimaging literature, activation likelihood estimation (ALE) can identify brain locations showing a consistent response across multiple experiments. This approach is based on the collection of peak coordinates from each study included in the meta-analysis rather than the input of raw images (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). To date, the ALE technique has been successfully applied to neuroimaging studies of various neurological and psychiatric disorders (Shao et al.,  ; Weng et al.,  ). Hence, our present study aimed to quantitatively conduct a meta-analysis using the ALE algorithm to determine the resting-state brain anomalies underlying T2DM. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search Strategies and Study Selection \n  \nThis meta-analysis was performed according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria (Stroup et al.,  ). A comprehensive literature search up to May 2016 was conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Embase using the following search terms: (1) \u201cneuroimaging\u201d <OR > \u201cfMRI,\u201d (2) \u201cresting state\u201d; and (3) \u201ctype 2 diabetes mellitus\u201d <OR > \u201ctype 2 diabetes\u201d <OR > \u201cT2DM\u201d. Our search was restricted to humans. In addition, we reviewed the references cited in articles that were retrieved. \n\nStudies were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) published as an article (not a letter or an abstract); (2) comparisons of T2DM patients with healthy control groups; and (3) clearly reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates of the activation areas (x, y, z). Studies reporting only findings for specific ROIs were not included in the present meta-analysis. For studies that contained two independent patient samples or used two independent methodologies, the appropriate coordinates were extracted as two separate experiments (Cui et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ). We did not intentionally exclude studies that used a modality other than fMRI or focused on a particular analytic approach. Thus, the methods used in our included studies covered the following approaches: amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), independent component analysis (ICA), arterial spin labeling (ASL) and degree centrality (DC). Overall, nine fMRI studies (11 experiments) were included in the ALE meta-analysis (Table  ). One study used the ASL perfusion MRI technique to measure resting-state abnormalities in cerebral blood flow in T2DM patients. Two independent reviewers (XW and CYC) evaluated the methodology and the risk of bias of the eligible studies. Any disagreements were assessed by the third reviewer (MJ). The majority opinion was used for the final analysis. We extracted demographic data from each article, including the first author\u2019s name, year of publication, total patient number, sex distribution, patient mean age and range and statistical thresholds. \n  \n List of all studies included in the meta-analysis: demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects  . \n  \n Abbreviations: SD, standard deviation; SPM, statistical parametric mapping; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; FWE, family-wise error. ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; ReHo, regional homogeneity; ICA, independent component analysis; ASL, arterial spin labeling; DC, Degree centrality  . \n  \n\n### Data Extraction and Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe x, y and z peak activation coordinates of all eligible contrasts constituted the meta-analysis input. The MNI coordinates were recorded and implemented in GingerALE 2.3.3  (Research Imaging Institute of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA). \n\nGinger ALE software was used to compare the brain changes between T2DM patients and healthy controls. The reported loci of maximal anatomical differences were modeled as the peaks of three-dimensional Gaussian probability density functions defined by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), which was set according to a quantitative uncertainty model (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). ALE values were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis by measuring the union model activation (MA) maps modeled above. This revised analysis tested for convergence by study (random effects) instead of foci (fixed effects). These maps were finally thresholded at   P   < 0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using the false-discovery rate (FDR; q; Genovese et al.,  ). The volume of the minimum cluster threshold was set at 200 mm . The coordinates of the weighted center were generated for each cluster. The resulting significant anatomical areas were labeled based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox v2.1 (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The results were visualized with Mango software  using the Colin brain template in the MNI space . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe identified nine eligible studies (Xia et al.,  ,  , ; Cui et al.,  ,  ,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ) for the meta-analysis according to the search criteria mentioned above. In one study, the analysis was performed based on two different subgroups of T2DM patients who were then compared with the same healthy control group (Peng et al.,  ). In another study, the analysis was performed with two different methodologies (Wang et al.,  ). Therefore, we treated these studies as unique reports, with each patient subgroup included independently in the meta-analysis; therefore, a total of 11 datasets were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Figure   shows the details of the literature search strategy and data extraction process. The clinical and demographic data of the participants from all recruited studies are presented in Table  . The patients and controls from each study were generally matched by age, gender and education. \n  \n Flow diagram of the literature search.   The flow diagram shows the results of the systematic search for the selected studies in this meta-analysis. \n  \nAs illustrated in Figure  , a total of 73 peak foci were reported in this meta-analysis. Compared to healthy controls, T2DM patients had widespread reduced resting-sate neural activity in the whole brain, including the bilateral lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). However, enhancements were also observed in the right precuneus and left superior frontal gyrus. Table   displays the coordinates of the cluster maxima. \n  \n Resting-state brain activity alterations in T2DM patients compared to healthy controls.

By analyzing nine eligible studies, this meta-analysis identified consistent regions of resting-state activity brain anomalies across almost the entire brain of T2DM patients, including the frontal, parietal, sensorimotor, temporal, occipital and insular cortices. Therefore, T2DM-related neuropsychiatric impairment is believed to be correlated with diffuse aberrant resting-state brain activity involving both cortical and subcortical structures, and these findings will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of neuropathological mechanisms of this disorder. \n\nConsistent with previous brain perfusion studies without resultant coordinates (Novak et al.,  ), parietal and occipital regions were found to be significantly altered in this meta-analysis. As a key region of the visual cortex, the occipital gyrus is the dominant region that exhibited remarkable reduction of resting-state neural activity in T2DM patients, consistent with the idea that visuospatial dysfunction is a common manifestation in T2DM patients (Moran et al.,  ). Worse visuospatial performance has been observed in T2DM patients than in their matched controls (Bangen et al.,  ), which could be due to the deficits in this area. Furthermore, the postcentral gyrus is known to be the main sensory receptive region for the sense of touch, proprioception, pain and temperature, which could contribute to common diabetic limb pain and temperature sensation decline (Cauda et al.,  ). In fact, impaired sensorimotor function has been described in T2DM patients with peripheral neuropathy (Menz et al.,  ). Nevertheless, the cause-and-effect relationship between deactivation in the postcentral gyrus and diabetic neuropathy cannot be explained at this stage because all the included studies were cross-sectional. \n\nThe temporal lobe has been linked to memory, verbal fluency, language processing and speech production, which are impaired in T2DM patients (McCrimmon et al.,  ). T2DM patients showed an abnormal pattern in the inferior temporal gyrus in the current study, which is also consistent with a previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study that revealed that T2DM patients exhibited gray matter atrophy in the right temporal lobe (Chen et al.,  ). Although it has been assumed that functional activity changes could precede or lead to subtle brain structural abnormalities, the relationship between functional and structural alterations should be further clarified by longitudinal studies. Several hypothesis-driven MRI studies have also demonstrated the vulnerability of the temporal lobe in T2DM patients. By seeding the PCC during a resting-state fMRI scan, two different research groups reported decreased functional connectivity within the temporal lobe (Musen et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Similarly, by seeding the bilateral hippocampus, abnormal connections within the temporal lobe have also been found. A subtle effect of T2DM on cortical atrophy has also been observed in this area (Brundel et al.,  ). These aforementioned findings provide evidence of disrupted temporal functioning in T2DM patients and suggest that temporal dysfunction should be evaluated when cognitive decline occurs in T2DM patients. \n\nReduced resting-state brain activity in the cerebellum and insula may also contribute to cognitive deficits in T2DM patients. The cerebellum controls not only motor coordination but also advanced cognitive function (Marklund et al.,  ). Given that the salience network has been found to be impaired in T2DM patients (Chen et al.,  ), and the insula acts as an integral area in the salience network (Menon and Uddin,  ), decreased insula activity could lead to impaired generation of appropriate behavioral responses to salient stimuli in these patients. Interestingly, according to the results, the right hemisphere of T2DM patients is more seriously impaired than the left hemisphere. Likewise, the effects of T2DM on the cortical surface and volume were only significantly pronounced in the right hemisphere (Brundel et al.,  ). The right hemisphere has been determined to be dominant over the left in geometric analysis and visual-spatial perceptual functioning, including the perception of distance, direction, shape, position, orientation and the detection of complex and hidden figures (Joseph,  ); therefore, visual-spatial perceptual disturbances, which have been described in T2DM-related cognitive decline, could arise due to right hemisphere impairment. Coincidentally, according to some results extracted from the studies included in this meta-analysis, performance on one neuropsychological test that reflects visual-spatial function, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, has been observed to be correlated with the neural activity in the right brain region (Xia et al.,  ). Nonetheless, because most studies in this field observed brain alterations on both sides in T2DM patients, the lateralization of impairment of brain activity in T2DM patients requires further investigation. \n\nAn additional finding of the present meta-analysis was hyperactivity in the frontoparietal cortex. The precuneus is involved in visuospatial function and working memory, and the frontal lobe is considered as a critical region involved in executive function and attention that subserves cognitive and emotional processing (Radua et al.,  ). These enhanced activities could act in a compensatory or recruitment capacity in T2DM patients such that their cognitive performance could be retained to some extent. \n\nSeveral limitations should be noted in this meta-analysis. First, the number of included studies was relatively small. Second, ALE can provide excellent control of false positive results, but false negatives are more difficult to avoid (Radua et al.,  ). Finally, heterogeneity of the included studies, such as the demographics of the patients and different imaging modalities that represented different aspects of resting-state abnormalities, could not be entirely excluded. For example, ALFF and ReHo are relevant to the intensity and temporal synchronization of regional spontaneous neuronal activity in the whole brain, respectively (Biswal et al.,  ; Zang et al.,  ). ICA decomposes the entire resting-state BOLD data set into spatially distributed components and automatically identifies meaningful brain networks (Mantini et al.,  ), and ASL perfusion MRI measures regional cerebral blood flow and reflects regional brain metabolism and neural activity (Detre and Alsop,  ). Despite these differences, various analytic approaches might be complementary to each other and provide more comprehensive information. Similar patterns of resting-state anomalies could also be detected by different analytic modalities. For instance, reduced resting-state activity in the occipital lobe was found in most of our included studies, regardless of the imaging modality. \n\nIn summary, this meta-analysis demonstrated robust resting-state brain anomalies in T2DM patients compared to healthy controls that were widespread in the frontal, parietal, sensorimotor, temporal, occipital and insular cortex. Further large, multicenter, resting-state fMRI studies are required to comprehensively investigate whether this abnormal activity pattern is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for T2DM-related neuropsychiatric impairment. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nWX and Y-CC performed the analysis and wrote the manuscript.

Neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in resting-state activity that could represent the neural signature of tinnitus, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the data. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of published neuroimaging studies aimed at identifying a common core of resting-state brain abnormalities in tinnitus patients. \n\n Methods  : A systematic search was conducted for whole-brain resting-state neuroimaging studies with SPECT, PET and functional MRI that compared chronic tinnitus patients with healthy controls. The authors searched PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge and Embase databases for neuroimaging studies on tinnitus published up to September 2016. From each study, coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences between tinnitus subjects and controls. Meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method. \n\n Results  : Data were included from nine resting-state neuroimaging studies that reported a total of 51 distinct foci. The meta-analysis identified consistent regions of increased resting-state brain activity in tinnitus patients relative to controls that included, bilaterally, the insula, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum posterior lobe and right superior frontal gyrus. Moreover, decreased brain activity was only observed in the left cuneus and right thalamus. \n\n Conclusions  : The current meta-analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain abnormalities that may serve as neuroimaging markers and contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms for chronic tinnitus. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTinnitus is the conscious perception of sound in the absence of an internal or external acoustic signal (Jastreboff,  ). In the United States, an estimated 50 million adults have experienced tinnitus occasionally, and 16 million adults are estimated to experience frequent tinnitus (Shargorodsky et al.,  ). The central nervous system is believed to play a major role in its development and maintenance of tinnitus (Rauschecker et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ; De Ridder et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Previous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies (Lockwood et al.,  ; Kaltenbach et al.,  ) suggest that tinnitus may arise from aberrant firing patterns or high levels of spontaneous neural activity in the central auditory pathway rather than the cochlea. However, evidences suggest that other brain regions outside the classical auditory pathway may involve attentional mechanisms that contribute to the persistent awareness of the phantom sound as well as the development of anxiety and distress leading to disabling features of chronic tinnitus (Mirz et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ; Henry et al.,  ). Despite extensive research, the brain abnormalities and neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic tinnitus remain poorly understood. One of the major questions is what regions of the human brain are involved in tinnitus, a question that has been explored in numerous imaging studies (Jastreboff et al.,  ; Lockwood et al.,  ; Mirz et al.,  ; Rauschecker et al.,  ; De Ridder et al.,  ). \n\nA number of existing neurophysiological mechanisms and models have been proposed to account for the pathophysiology of tinnitus patients, such as central gain (Schaette and McAlpine,  ), neural synchrony (Seki and Eggermont,  ), frontostriatal gating (Rauschecker et al.,  ), thalamocortical dysrhythmia (Llin\u00e1s et al.,  ), noise-canceling deficit (Rauschecker et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ), global workspace (De Ridder et al.,  ), and precision\/predictive coding models (Sedley et al.,  ). However, there is a lack of consensus as to which neural mechanism(s) and what regions of the central nervous system are common to the diverse population of tinnitus patients participating in the imaging studies. Human neuroimaging studies have revealed augmented activity in tinnitus patients in several brain regions within and\/or beyond classical auditory pathways. According to the model of De Ridder et al. ( ) tinnitus is underpinned by the integration of multiple nonspecific subnetworks of the brain involving general components of cognition, emotion and memory. Communication between these different subnetworks occurs at specific hubs, brain areas that are involved in multiple subnetworks simultaneously. These different subnetworks, which interact at different oscillatory frequencies, communicate with one another at partially overlapping hubs. Nonetheless, the role of the potential hubs involved in multiple subnetworks of tinnitus still remains unclear. \n\nSince about 85% of chronic tinnitus patients perceived the phantom sound constantly (Schecklmann et al.,  ), the resting-state fMRI measurements seem well suited to identify the neural structures, subnetworks and hubs involved in tinnitus. A growing number of studies have used resting-state fMRI to investigate tinnitus (Husain and Schmidt,  ) and multiple brain networks implicated in tinnitus have been identified, such as the auditory network (Burton et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ; Maudoux et al.,  , ; Schmidt et al.,  ; Hinkley et al.,  ; Minami et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ), default mode network (DMN; Schmidt et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ,  ; Leaver et al.,  ), dorsal attention network (DAN; Burton et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ), ventral attention network (VAN; Burton et al.,  ), and visual network (Burton et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ,  ). As such, tinnitus can be seen as the interaction of multiple brain subnetworks, each contributing to different aspects of tinnitus such as its acoustic features, emotional affect and awareness or attention. However, these studies reported relatively inconsistent results. For instance, most researches demonstrated the increased resting-state brain activity between tinnitus patients and healthy controls (Maudoux et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ,  ; Laureano et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ; Ueyama et al.,  ), while others failed to identify any regions of increased brain activity (Geven et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ). Moreover, several studies have failed to detect any differences in network processing between tinnitus patients and controls (Wineland et al.,  ; Davies et al.,  ). These reported discrepancies can potentially be attributed to the limited sample size, variable clinical demographics and use of different methods. Furthermore, in many studies tinnitus groups were not compared to an appropriate control group (Leaver et al.,  ; Schecklmann et al.,  ; Lanting et al.,  ). \n\nTinnitus is a very heterogeneous condition with respect to the characteristics of the perceived sound, degree of associated awareness and distress, duration and comorbidities (Landgrebe et al.,  ). Given the high heterogeneity, it is not surprising that inconsistencies across studies are encountered. Nevertheless, there may be some commonalities across these diverse studies. One approach to identifying a common core is to perform a meta-analysis of the existing resting-state studies of patients with chronic tinnitus with the goal of identifying brain network hubs in tinnitus patients common to neuroimaging studies of tinnitus. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is the most common coordinate-based meta-analytic method used to analyze the neuroimaging literature; this approach seeks to identify brain locations with a consistent pattern of response across experiments. This approach is based on the collection of peak coordinates from each study included in the meta-analysis rather than the input of raw images (Turkeltaub et al.,  ; Wager et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). ALE technique has been successfully applied to neuroimaging studies of various neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy (Li et al.,  ), Parkinson\u2019s disease (Shao et al.,  ), schizophrenia (Ellison-Wright and Bullmore,  ), and narcolepsy (Weng et al.,  ). Song et al. ( ) performed a meta-analysis exclusively of PET studies of tinnitus using the ALE method to retrieve the most consistent activation areas across different task dimensions. However, this meta-analysis did not include the large body of fMRI studies that might prove useful in detecting resting-state brain abnormalities in tinnitus patients. Therefore the goal of the current study was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of several different types of resting state neuroimaging data in the tinnitus literature that met our inclusion criterion. To accomplish this, we used the ALE algorithm to determine the resting-state brain abnormalities in tinnitus patients compared to healthy controls. Our working hypothesis was that the ALE analysis would identify a common core of brain regions linked to tinnitus generation despite the heterogeneity of the patients and experimental methods. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search Strategies and Study Selection \n  \nOur analysis was performed according to the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria (Stroup et al.,  ). A comprehensive literature search up to September, 2016 was conducted in PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and Embase using the following search terms: (1) \u201cneuroimaging\u201d <OR > \u201cPET\u201d <OR > \u201cfMRI\u201d; (2) \u201cresting state\u201d; and (3) \u201ctinnitus\u201d. Our search was restricted to humans. In addition, we manually reviewed the references cited in articles that were retrieved. \n\nStudies were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) published as an article (and not a letter or an abstract); (2) comparisons of tinnitus patients with healthy control groups on a whole-brain level; and (3) clearly reported Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach coordinates of the activation areas (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ). Studies reporting only findings for specific ROIs were not included in the present meta-analysis. In accordance with many previous ALE meta-analyses (Laird et al.,  ; Petacchi et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; K\u00fchn and Gallinat,  ), we included coordinates resulting from fMRI as well as from PET data. We included data from PET and fMRI studies and other data analysis techniques despite the fact that they have different physiological bases and theoretical assumptions since both methods have been used to identify differences between the intrinsic brain function in patients compared with controls. The rationale was to provide an all-encompassing overview of attempts to identify resting-state abnormalities in tinnitus patients. Our search criteria yielded a total of 67 peer-reviewed published articles. Of the 67 studies, 26 studies were excluded as these studies were not about comparisons between tinnitus patients and healthy controls; nine articles were excluded since these were electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies; another four pulsatile tinnitus studies and four animal studies were excluded. Fifteen studies were further excluded since these did not report detailed peak coordinates over the whole brain. Finally, nine resting-state neuroimaging studies, six fMRI, two SPECT and one PET, were included in the ALE meta-analysis (Figure   and Table  ). \n  \n Flow diagram of the literature search.   Flow diagram shows the results of the systematic search for the selected studies in this meta-analysis. \n    \n List of all studies included in the meta-analysis: subjects\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics  . \n  \n Note: TIN, tinnitus; HC, healthy control; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission tomography; SPECT, single photon emission computed tomography; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; ReHo, regional homogeneity; ICA, independent component analysis; DC, degree centrality; SPM, statistical parametric mapping; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; FDR, false discovery rate; FWE, family-wise error; NA, not available. *Only reported mean age in this study  . \n  \nTwo independent reviewers (CYC and FW) evaluated the methodology and the risk of bias of the eligible studies. First, they assessed the titles of the search results and retrieved the relevant articles. Second, the articles that remained eligible were assessed based on their abstract to determine whether any of the inclusion criteria were not met. The full text of all remaining articles was then assessed with a data extraction template, which was constructed for the purpose of organizing and extracting information from the included articles and excluding articles without peak values. The reviewers analyzed all articles in terms of patient selection and their comparable controls, blinding, diagnostic criteria and regression methods. Any disagreements were assessed by the third reviewer (FB). The demographic data were extracted from each article, including the first author\u2019s name, year of publication, total patient number, sex distribution, mean patient age and range, statistic thresholds, hearing and psychological status. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThe   x  ,   y  , and   z   peak activation coordinates of all eligible contrasts constituted the meta-analysis input. The data originally reported in Talairach spaces were converted to MNI coordinates (Lancaster et al.,  ). The data from MNI coordinates were texted and implemented in GingerALE 2.3.3 , Research Imaging Institute of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA). Coordinates in each study were independently extracted by two authors (CYC and FW). \n\n\n### ALE Meta-Analysis \n  \nGinger ALE software was used to analyze the resting-state brain activity between tinnitus patients and healthy controls. The reported loci of maximal anatomical differences were modeled as the peaks of three-dimensional Gaussian probability density functions defined by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), which was set according to a quantitative uncertainty model (Laird et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). ALE values were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis by measuring the union model activation maps modeled above. This revised analysis tested for convergence by studies (random effects) instead of foci (fixed effects). Following the method described by Turkeltaub et al. ( ,  ), 1000 permutations were used to determine which tests were statistically significant and threshold determined for the resultant ALE map. A whole-brain histogram was computed in which the null hypothesis of uniformly distributed foci was rejected for voxels with an ALE value greater than the critical threshold, defined as the 100(1\u2212\u03b1)th percentile of the permutation distribution, where   \u03b1   refers to the desired level of significance. The analyses were performed at a cluster forming threshold (reported with each   p   value and ALE thresholds in the results, ALE values greater than this threshold are statistically significant) computed using a   p   < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using false-discovery rate (FDR; Genovese et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ). The volume of the minimum cluster threshold was set at 200 mm . The coordinates of the weighted center were generated for each cluster. The resulting significant anatomical areas were labeled based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox v2.1 (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Results were visualized with Mango software , using the Colin brain template in the MNI space . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nUsing our inclusion\/exclusion criteria, we identified nine eligible neuroimaging studies utilizing different methods, including SPECT (Laureano et al.,  ; Ueyama et al.,  ), PET (Geven et al.,  ), and fMRI (Maudoux et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ,  ,  ; Leaver et al.,  ). Figure   is a flow diagram showing the steps in the identification, exclusion and inclusion of the studies. The clinical and demographic data of the participants from all recruited studies are presented in Table  . The subjects of patients and controls from each study are generally comparable by age, sex, and education. The hearing and psychological status are also shown in Table  . \n  \n The hearing and psychological status of the subjects included in all the studies  . \n  \n Note: HL, hearing loss; NA, not available  . \n  \nAs illustrated in Figure  , a total of 13 peak foci were reported in this meta-analysis. Compared with healthy controls, tinnitus patients showed increased resting-state neural activity bilaterally in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), parahippocampal gyrus, insula, cerebellar posterior lobe and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Moreover, decreased brain activity was also observed in the left cuneus and right thalamus.

By analyzing nine neuroimaging studies, the meta-analysis identified consistent regions of aberrant neural activity mainly in the non-auditory brain regions, including the MTG, frontal cortex, parahippocampus, insula, cerebellum, cuneus, and thalamus, in different aspects of tinnitus. Surprisingly, the auditory cortex was not detected in this study. This may be due to the fact that most patients in these studies had little or mild hearing loss. These non-auditory areas are parts of separable subnetworks representing multiple clinical cognitive and emotional aspects of tinnitus; resting-state disruptions in these areas may provide new insights on the neuropathological mechanisms of this disorder. \n\n### Middle Temporal Gyrus \n  \nThe MTG has been suggested to be involved in cognitive processes including language, semantic memory and multimodal sensory integration (Cabeza and Nyberg,  ). A quantitative EEG study has demonstrated higher \u03b12-band activity in the MTG in tinnitus patients with higher distress (Vanneste et al.,  ). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses revealed that the gray matter increases in the MTG in tinnitus patients with hearing impairment (Boyen et al.,  ). Using resting-state fMRI, significantly increased spontaneous neural activity was observed in the right MTG in tinnitus patients (Chen et al.,  ). Moreover, Zhang et al. ( ) showed decreased functional connectivity between right MTG and left thalamus, which was negatively correlated with tinnitus severity. In addition, the MTG has been regarded as a key region of the DMN (Raichle et al.,  ). The DMN, consisting of nodes in the MTG, posterior cingulate\/precuneus, angular gyrus and medial frontal gyrus, is most active at rest and shows reduced activity when a subject enters a task-based state involving attention or goal-directed behavior (Raichle et al.,  ; Mantini et al.,  ). As a condition involving the perception of a phantom auditory sensation, tinnitus might lead to dysfunction of the DMN. Previous fMRI studies found abnormal functional connectivity within the DMN associated with tinnitus distress (Burton et al.,  ; Maudoux et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ). Nevertheless, the source or type of aberrant neural activity within DMN regions in tinnitus remains unclear. Our results indicate that increased neuronal activity in the MTG may be responsible for disrupting the DMN in tinnitus patients. \n\n\n### Frontal Cortex \n  \nThe frontal cortex, including the SFG and IFG, exhibited increased neural activity in tinnitus patients in the current study. Rauschecker et al. ( ) developed a model to demonstrate structural and functional differences in ventromedial prefrontal cortex that were associated with tinnitus subjective loudness, indicating that frontal cortex may contribute to certain perceptual features of tinnitus. Resting-state fMRI studies have pointed out that the abnormalities of the frontal cortex could act as a direct mechanism of tinnitus chronification (Burton et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ,  , ,  ), which are confirmed by the current meta-analysis. Based on the previous fMRI studies, the SFG has been regarded as a major integrative hub of the tinnitus network architecture (Chen et al.,  ), which can receive and integrate all kinds of information from different parts of the brain from inside and outside the body. Besides, it can also timely organize efferent impulses to ensure the coordination of the central nervous system as a whole (Mathiak et al.,  ; Melloni et al.,  ). A possible explanation for our result was that the increased activity of the SFG might be due to feedback inhibition of an over active auditory network (Downar et al.,  ). Furthermore, the IFG serves as the core region of response inhibition and IFG activity might mirror the attempt to control the bottom-up attention allocation to the tinnitus percept in a top-down manner (Aron et al.,  ). In one hypothetical model, the fronto-insular cortex is part of a salience network that drives switching by a central executive control network important to maintaining and adjusting attention (Sridharan et al.,  ). In another model, the IFG and the insula act as executive control components in the attention system that regulates dorsal and VANs, which lack direct interconnections (Shulman et al.,  ). Taken together, we suggest that tinnitus distress, salience, or attentional focus is associated with increased resting-state activity in these brain subnetworks. \n\n\n### Parahippocampus \n  \nThe parahippocampal area has been hypothesized to play a central role in memory recollection and transferring information from the hippocampus to the association areas, which might explain its involvement in the generation of simple auditory phantom percepts such as tinnitus (De Ridder et al.,  ; Vanneste and De Ridder,  ). EEG study suggested that tinnitus patients differed from healthy controls by increased delta and theta activity in the parahippocampus (Moazami-Goudarzi et al.,  ). Prior resting-state fMRI studies also provided further support linking tinnitus physiopathology with parahippocampal region involved in mnemonic network (Maudoux et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Leaver et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Insula \n  \nThe increased response in the insula, mainly the anterior part, may be an indication of successful adaption to the tinnitus perception (van der Loo et al.,  ). On the basis of resting-state quantitative EEG, the insula has been implicated in tinnitus and specific tinnitus characteristics (van der Loo et al.,  ; Vanneste et al.,  , ). Greater synchrony of alpha activity was observed bilaterally in the anterior insula of patients with more severe tinnitus-related distress (Vanneste et al.,  ). In addition, chronic tinnitus patients showed enhanced spontaneous neuronal activity and functional connectivity in bilateral anterior insula were revealed by resting-state fMRI (Burton et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). \n\nFurthermore, the insula is one of key nodes in the common brain circuit of both tinnitus and chronic pain (Rauschecker et al.,  ). Although there also exist important differences between the two disorders, the striking similarities and associations indicate that tinnitus and chronic pain share common neuropathological mechanisms. Now advances in neuroimaging have demonstrated that similar structures and functional systems are involved and probably play a central role in both disorders (Rauschecker et al.,  ). Significant loss of gray matter and compromised circuit function are detected in several specific regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and insula (De Ridder et al.,  ; Rauschecker et al.,  ). These areas act as a central gatekeeping system for perceptual sensations, which determines the affective value of sensory stimuli and modulates information flow in the brain (Rauschecker et al.,  ). Tinnitus and chronic pain occur when this system is compromised. \n\nAlthough the EEG has been used to determine resting-state long-range functional coupling in tinnitus, it has many differences from the resting-state fMRI (Vanneste et al.,  , ). EEG does not offer the spatial resolution of fMRI, but offer the advantage of being quiet and not influencing the resting-state network of tinnitus. Thus these two techniques may measure different aspects of spontaneous neuronal activity (Tagliazucchi et al.,  ). Britz et al. ( ) extracted four resting-state networks from the EEG data that were the equivalent of stereotypical fMRI networks dedicated to auditory, attetional, visual and self-referential processing, but DMN was not detected by EEG in Britz\u2019s study. Other studies have correlated the DMN with beta-2 (Laufs et al.,  ) or with delta (Mantini et al.,  ) spectral bands of EEG. Therefore, a direct comparison of EEG and resting-state fMRI is complicated by the fact that similar EEG power bands may be correlated with varying fMRI-generated spatial maps and a single resting-state network may be linked with different EEG spectral patterns (Laufs et al.,  ; Musso et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Cerebellum \n  \nFurthermore, although the cerebellum is primarily involved in motor actions and control, several cerebellar regions such as the paraflocculus and vermis receive inputs from auditory centers (Petacchi et al.,  ). Brozoski et al. ( ) observed increased activity in the parafloccular lobe of the cerebellum in animals with tinnitus confirmed and suggested that the cerebellum acts as a gating control mechanism comparing the afferent input from the cochlea with descending signals from the auditory cortex (Bauer et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). Consistent with this view, hyperactivity in the auditory cortex and increased functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and cerebellum were observed in rats with salicylate-induced tinnitus (Chen et al.,  ). If this cerebellar-tinnitus gating hypothesis is correct, then inactivating the cerebellum could possibly suppress the sound perception of tinnitus. Based on these findings, we suggest that cerebellum may play a pivotal role of gating control in tinnitus. Furthermore, using resting-state fMRI, chronic tinnitus patients exhibited enhanced functional connectivity in the cerebellar hemisphere that was associated with tinnitus distress (Maudoux et al.,  ; Ueyama et al.,  ), indicating the involvement of cerebellum in auditory system. \n\n\n### Cuneus \n  \nOur meta-analysis found decreased brain activity in the cuneus of tinnitus patients. We speculate that the connections between auditory and visual regions make it possible to alter the brain activity in the visual areas (Kaltenbach et al.,  ; Cate et al.,  ). This is consistent with prior fMRI studies showing negative correlations of functional connectivity between auditory and visual resting-state subnetworks in tinnitus patients (Burton et al.,  ; Maudoux et al.,  ). One possibility is that the phantom sounds might act to decrease spontaneous activity in visual areas because of the salience of the tinnitus perception (Chen et al.,  ,  ). Thus, tinnitus may be regarded as the consequence of multisensory interactions between auditory and visual regions. \n\n\n### Thalamus \n  \nThe thalamus, which regulates the flow of sensory information to and from the auditory cortex, has been thought to play a key role in tinnitus (Richardson et al.,  ). Llin\u00e1s et al. ( ) hypothesized that tinnitus results from thalamocortical dysrhythmias triggered by peripheral damage. Prior MRI studies have identified structural and functional abnormalities involved in thalamocortical network of tinnitus (M\u00fchlau et al.,  ; Rauschecker et al.,  ; Benson et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Lanting et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). Consistent with our results, Zhang et al. ( ) showed decreased functional connectivity between the thalamus and auditory cortical areas in tinnitus, which may be a reflection of disrupted thalamic gating mechanism (Rauschecker et al.,  ). The thalamus is regarded as the center of ascending noise canceling system, and thus if it is dysfunctional, noise canceling is no longer possible and the subject may perceive tinnitus (Rauschecker et al.,  ). However, the mechanisms responsible for these functional changes are unknown, but could involve aberrant inhibition (Richardson et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nSeveral inevitable limitations should be noted in our study. First, the heterogeneity of the included studies could affect the current results. In particular, hearing loss is always a complicating factor in structural and functional studies of tinnitus. Melcher et al. ( ) compared tinnitus patients with controls who were matched for hearing thresholds in the standard clinical frequencies and found that gray matter changes were not related to tinnitus but instead negatively correlated with hearing thresholds at frequencies above 8 kHz. Therefore, a more complete characterization of hearing loss is desirable. Moreover, tinnitus can become a significant psychological problem and comorbid symptoms such as depression and anxiety are potential confounds on the observed brain activity in tinnitus patients (Leaver et al.,  ). It is necessary to characterize the psychological health problems as covariates in the analyses. The problems of differential tinnitus variables on structural and functional changes in neural activity can be solved using correlational analyses of large samples (Schecklmann et al.,  ) and comparisons of different tinnitus subtypes (Vanneste and De Ridder,  ). Second, voxel-wise meta-analytic approach like ALE provides excellent control of false positive results, but it is more difficult to avoid false negatives (Radua et al.,  ). Voxel-wise meta-analysis is based on the pooling of peak stereotactic coordinates rather than on raw statistical brain maps from the original studies, which could give rise to less accurate results (Radua et al.,  ). Furthermore, fMRI produces aversive scanner noise which has been shown to interfere with auditory processing in the human brain at the physiological and psychological level (Perrachione and Ghosh,  ). The concept of resting state is somewhat problematic in tinnitus studies because the auditory pathway is likely to be activated by scanner noise which is nearly impossible to completely eliminate even with ear plugs or active noise reduction (Logothetis et al.,  ). Therefore, this limitation should be taken into consideration when interpreting the resting-state fMRI data in auditory system-related researches. Finally, the number of included neuroimaging studies is relatively small. Further explorations are needed to perform the subgroup analyses or meta-regression analyses for the control of confounding factors that might influence resting-state brain function in tinnitus, such as the imaging methodology and data analysis method. Most importantly, we should establish standard protocols for resting-state fMRI researches to minimize heterogeneity on the experimental side. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nUsing the ALE-based meta-analysis, our study demonstrated abnormal resting-state neural activity mainly in the non-auditory brain areas, including the MTG, frontal cortex, parahippocampus, insula, cerebellum, cuneus and thalamus. In accordance to the hypothesis, these results show that there exist several important brain hubs in specific tinnitus network encompassing DMN, attentional, mnemonic, salience, visual and thalamocortical subnetworks. Aberrant resting-state brain patterns in tinnitus-related networks may help enhance our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms underlying chronic subjective tinnitus. Nonetheless, a theoretical pathophysiological framework capable of explaining all these aspects in one model is still highly required. There is thus hope that a single cure can be found that would target a common mechanism. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nY-CC and FW designed the experiment, reviewed the literatures, performed the analysis and wrote the manuscript.

Despite clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of ST36 acupuncture, the brain activities and the neural mechanism following acupuncture at ST36 remain unclear. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nLiterature searches were conducted on online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine, for task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based   d   mapping meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted on control procedures, manual acupuncture, electrical acupuncture (EA), and acupuncture-specific activations. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of needle retention time on brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. The activated brain regions were further decoded and mapped on large-scale functional networks to further decipher the clinical relevance of acupuncturing at ST36. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities. Our findings may have clinical implications for acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders. \n\n\n## Systematic Review Registration \n  \n. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcupuncture, an ancient technique in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat various conditions for thousands of years and has been widely accepted as an important modality of complementary therapy in modern medicine ( ). Evidence has shown that acupuncture improves cerebral circulation, relieves pain, and modulates neural function ( ,  ). The   deqi   sensation is the arrival of Qi, is the special feeling and reaction of the human body after filiform needles are inserted into an acupoint, and is also the key to the effect of acupuncture. It is believed that acupuncture excites afferent nerve receptors, stimulating signals that alter the central nervous system's signal integration ( ). However, it is difficult to establish the central nervous effects of acupuncture in humans due to the diversity of acupoints for various clinical settings and inadequate trials. \n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying acupuncture-related neural activities with advanced functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography ( ,  ). fMRI measures the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of the brain tissue, or more specifically, the oxygen demand surge in a brain region with increased neural activities, thus localizing the activity fluctuations of the brain ( ). With a task-based design, fMRI is capable of measuring the temporal effects of acupuncture and capturing the activated brain regions' responses to stimulations ( ). \n\nIt is important to identify the acupuncture-stimulated brain regions, which may help to elucidate the neural mechanisms of acupuncture. Among 720 acupoints on the human body, ST36 (Stomach 36,   zusanli  ) is a commonly used acupoint in animal studies ( ) and clinical practices for gastric disorders, stroke, pain, sleep disturbances, and some psychological diseases ( \u2013 ). Recent evidence from animal experiments has shown the neuroanatomical basis of ST36 in driving the vagal\u2013adrenal axis, thus modulating anti-inflammatory responses in mice ( ). Research in healthy individuals demonstrated the effects of ST36 in the somatosensory and motor areas, cerebellum, and limbic system ( ,  ). A meta-analysis on block-design fMRI, including both patients and healthy individuals, demonstrated that acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation exclusively activates the right hemisphere of the brain, such as the right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri, right supramarginal gyrus, and pons ( ). Moreover, Bai et al. reported the time-varied effects of acupuncture at ST36 in fMRI ( ,  ), indicating time-dependent modes of brain activity responses to acupuncture. \n\nWithout prior clinical conditions, healthy individuals are ideal subjects to identify the specific brain activities following acupuncture. Some studies have shown increased brain activities in the insula ( ,  ), bilateral primary somatosensory area and the ipsilateral cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus (STG) ( \u2013 ), primary visual cortex pons, medulla regions ( ), and supplementary motor area ( ) when acupuncture was performed on ST36 in healthy individuals; however, other studies have yielded heterogeneous results of attenuated signals in limbic and paralimbic structures, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial pre-frontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles ( ,  ), primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex ( ), and precuneus ( ). Despite clinical fMRI studies of ST36 acupuncture, there is yet a consensus on the temporal neural activities following acupuncture at ST36 among healthy subjects. \n\nIn the present work, we summarized the current evidence of task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals with the seed-based   d   mapping (SDM) technique and functional network mapping and decoding analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the sources of heterogeneity between manual acupuncture (MA) and electrical acupuncture (EA). Additional subgroup analysis was also conducted on control procedures (sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation) and acupuncture-specific activations to further understand the brain activation patterns of acupuncture at ST36. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the potential confounding effects of needle retention time in correlation with brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. Specifically, since many studies omitted cerebellar activations, the present study focused only on the activations located in the cerebrum. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the neural activities of ST36 acupuncture stimulation in healthy subjects was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and for Acupuncture (PRISMA-A) guidelines and published research protocol on INPLASY (INPLASY2021120035). \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched for studies indexed in the following online databases from inception to September 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine. The following terms were used for the search: (\u201cST 36\u201d or \u201cST36\u201d or \u201c  zusanli  \u201d) and (\u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d). Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two authors, and the bibliographies of the articles were checked for additional retrievable relevant studies. \n\n\n### Eligibility Criteria \n  \nStudies were selected if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) published studies on single acupoint stimulation (c) conducted on at least 10 healthy subjects; (2) including the demographic information of the study sample; (3) conducting whole-brain analysis on task-based fMRI data; and (4) reporting the peak stimulation coordinates in standardized anatomic space, such as Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with corresponding cluster size and statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores). Studies were excluded from the final analysis if they were (1) analyses of the region-of-interest level or (2) reviews, meta-analyses, or animal studies. \n\n\n### Outcome Measurement \n  \n#### Main Outcomes \n  \nThe main outcomes are significantly activated brain regions in Talairach\/MNI coordinates with corresponding cluster statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores) for baseline vs. activation comparison on ST36 acupuncturing or control procedures, for an instant, sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation. \n\n\n#### Secondary Outcomes \n  \nThe secondary outcomes are the two-sample (or group-level) comparison among acupuncture stimulation at ST36 and control procedures (sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation) regarding significantly activated brain regions (in Talairach\/MNI coordinate) with corresponding cluster statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores) between groups. \n\n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThere were two authors independently extracted data from the original studies using a predesigned data extraction form. The following information was collected: first author's name, publication year, studied region, ethnicity, sex, sample size, dominant hand of the participants, experimental design, intervention, MRI acquisition protocols, neuroimaging processing software, and the coordinate system used in reporting of the results, as well as the correction method. Any discrepancies were resolved by referring to the original articles or consulting the lead author. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Procedures \n  \nFor the SDM meta-analysis, peak stimulated brain regions with cluster statistics (  p  -values or   z   values or   t   scores) were also collected. In general, the studies reported either Talairach or MNI coordinates, a text file renamed to the first author containing peak coordinates, and the associated   t   score was created. Additionally, a datasheet, including the first author's name,   t   threshold for significant clusters, number of participants in the experiment, and control groups, was created. For studies that reported multiple comparisons, the results of the acupuncture (ST36) and sham tests were recorded. For studies that reported   p  -values or   z   values, the statistics were converted to   t   scores using the online SDM converter. If a study did not provide information about the   t   threshold or corrected   p  -value, the minimum   t   score was used as a conservative estimation. Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI, version 6.2.2) is used in the current work to summarize the peak coordinates of brain activities in ST36 acupuncture stimulation (family-wise error-corrected followed by threshold free cluster enhancement with 1,000 permutations), and the results are thresholded to the statistical significance level of voxel-wise   p   < 0.005 with a cluster threshold of 50 voxels. An approach was adopted by conducting full analyses after iteratively leaving one of the included studies' datasets out to test the robustness of the results. Heterogeneity analyses with   I   statistics were carried out to examine the interstudy heterogeneity of individual clusters, and   I   > 30% was defined as major heterogeneity. \n\nSubgroup analysis was performed for the control procedures, such as sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation. The effects of MA and EA stimulation were also analyzed to explore the difference in brain activation under different stimulation intensities. Additional subgroup analysis was conducted in studies that reported direct comparisons between the ST36 acupuncture and control procedures to unmask the acupuncture-specified activated brain regions. \n\nThe needle retention time was meta-regressed as a variate to study the time-dependent heterogeneity of the activation in the brain during acupuncture at ST36. In the present meta-regression, if there were multiple stimulation blocks, the scanning length of the first stimulation block was regarded as the needle retention time (min). If the study measured the brain activities for a prolonged period after one stimulation was applied and reported a series of activations with the time the activations appeared, the time (min) an activation was detected was regarded as the needle retention time. The data were extracted according to different needle retention times. For the exploratory nature of meta-regression, stringent thresholds were applied (voxel-wise   p   < 0.0005 and cluster size > 50 voxels) to decrease false-positive findings. \n\nThe included studies were placed into a non-randomized comparative design; thus, methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) ( ) was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Publication bias was assessed by graphical inspection of the asymmetry of the funnel plot for the   z   score and evaluated through Egger's test. \n\n\n### Mapping on Brain Network and Functional Decoding \n  \nTo decipher the meta-analysis results at the network level, the identified ST36 brain activations in the meta-analysis were mapped onto large-scale functional networks based on whole-brain functional connectivity analysis ( ). To further interpret the function of the identified brain regions, we used the Neurosynth database ( ) for data-driven functional decoding. Briefly, relevant terms for which the meta-analysis map showed the largest correlations with the identified brain regions were extracted, and terms with similar functional meanings were merged and retained the largest correlation value. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study Characteristics \n  \nA total of 16 studies were retrieved in the preliminary literature search. All 16 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria ( ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ). The detailed search processes are presented in the PRISMA flowchart in  . In total, 401 right-handed healthy participants consisting of 199 male and 202 female subjects were included in the current study. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in  . A total of two included studies were conducted in the United States, 12 studies were conducted in China, 1 study was conducted in Korea, and the remaining study was conducted in Germany. Interventions included acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation with manual manipulations or electrical stimulation, whereas the control procedures included sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and local anesthesia before acupuncture at ST36. All the included studies involved applying different stimulations to the same group (or partially the same group) of subjects with a multi-block design or in different sessions. A total of eleven studies conducted acupuncture at the right ST36, 3 studies conducted acupuncture at the left ST36, 1 study stimulated bilateral ST36, and 1 study performed MA at the right ST36 and EA on the left ST36. Neuroimages were acquired through a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) were the dominant neuroimaging processing software among the included studies, and all results were reported in Talairach and MNI coordinate systems. Studies that reported activations from different stimulation procedures were extracted separately for subsequent subgroup analysis. Finally, baseline vs. activation results from 13 studies of verum acupuncture were used to synthesize the pooled effects of acupuncture at ST36 ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ), and baseline vs. activation results from 6 studies were pooled for the control procedure effects ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n  \nThe PRISMA flow diagram of the detailed search and literature selection processes. fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n    \nThe characteristics of the included studies. \n  \n MA, manual acupuncture; EA, electric acupuncture; CP, control point; NA, not available  . \n  \n\n### Methodology Assessments \n  \nThe potential methodological quality of the study and risk of bias were examined through the MINORS tool. Most of the studies failed to address the unbiased assessment process (blind to the evaluation of the end points, item 5), and none of the studies mentioned the sample size calculations or power estimation. Due to no current optimal standard of interventions for the neural effect of acupuncture (positive control), the included studies adopted negative control approaches, such as control point acupuncture, pressure or sensory tactile stimulation of the skin, control point acupuncture, and local anesthesia. We rated items 9 to 1 for all the studies. Hence, the overall MINORS scores ranged from 17 to 21. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis shows that acupuncture at ST36 positively activates three brain clusters (  and  ), namely, the opercular part of right IFGr (IFG. R; Brodmann area 48; 4946 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 48, 12, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 5.447;   p   < 0.001; extended to right insula, Rolandic operculum, supramarginal gyrus, and STG regions), left superior temporal gyrus (STG. L; 3,095 voxels; peak MNI coordinate: \u221246, \u22126, \u22126; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.893;   p   < 0.001; extended to left insula, Rolandic operculum, middle temporal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus regions), and right median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri (MCG. R; Brodmann area 32; 914 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 4, 14, 44; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.570;   p   < 0.001; extended to left median cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, left anterior cingulate\/paracingulate gyri, and left supplementary motor area). On the other hand, control stimulation procedures positively activate brain regions similar to but smaller than those in verum acupuncture except for MCG. R ( ), such as the right Rolandic operculum (Brodmann area 48; 1648 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 54, \u221214, 14; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.719;   p   < 0.001), left postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area 43; 489 voxels; peak MNI coordinate: \u221258, \u221212, 32; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.139;   p   < 0.001), and right insula (Brodmann area 47; 55 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 36, 22, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.717;   p   < 0.001). No negative activation was identified in the verum acupuncture or control stimulations. Except for MCG.R (  I   = 21.607% < 30%), the heterogeneity   I   values for the remaining identified clusters were <10%, indicating no heterogeneity among the studies. The jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that the pooled activation regions for acupuncture at ST36 were preserved, except that MCG.R failed to be identified while excluding Napadow et al.'s study ( ) on EA intensity ( ), indicating that the activation of these areas might be associated with electric stimulation or stimulus strength. Left- and right-side stimulation could be confounding to the analysis, and we performed additional sensitivity analysis on the main outcomes with x-axis flipped results from left ST36 stimulation studies to reduce false-negative errors from the meta-analysis. Similar outcomes were shown, indicating robustly activated regions during acupuncture at ST36 (  and  ).

A total of two subgroup analyses were conducted among 8 studies that adopted manual manipulation techniques ( ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and 5 studies that performed EA ( ,  \u2013 ,  ). The results ( ) showed that manual manipulation techniques positively activated the right supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann area 2; 158 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 66, \u221222, 32; peak SDM-  Z  : 5.841;   p   < 0.001) and opercular part of right IFG (Brodmann area 48; 113 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 48, 12, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.586;   p   = 0.003). Interestingly, EA positively activates wider areas ( ), such as the left superior frontal gyrus, medial orbital (Brodmann area 11; 2679 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u22126, 42, \u22128; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.003;   p   < 0.001), STG.

L (1,167 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u221246, \u22124, 0; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.197;   p   < 0.001), and left anterior thalamic projections (819 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u221212, 14, 6; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.323;   p   < 0.001). The subgroup analysis results of the manual manipulation techniques and EA indicated that electric stimulation could be the major source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. \n\nA total of five of the included studies reported group-level comparisons of verum acupuncture and control stimulations ( ,  \u2013 ); hence, an additional subgroup analysis was conducted to address another interest of the present study to identify the specified brain activations of acupuncture. Compared to control stimulations, a small area located in the right supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann area 42; 86 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 62, \u221224, 18; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.714;   p   < 0.001) was activated specifically following acupuncture on ST36 ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Regression Analysis \n  \nTo investigate the potential effects of needle retention time, a meta-regression analysis was conducted with the mixed-effects model. The meta-regression results (  and  ) showed that activation in the left olfactory cortex (Brodmann area 42; 163 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u22124, 24, \u221212; peak SDM-  Z  : 3.790;   p   < 0.0005) was positively associated with needle retention time [effect size: 0.083 95% CI (0.045, 0.120),   p   < 0.001]. \n  \nMeta-regression of the relationship between needle retention time and the estimated effect size of the left olfactory cortex. \n    \nThe brain region related to needle retention time. \n  \n MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, Seed-based d mapping; BA, Brodmann Area  . \n  \n\n### Large-Scale Brain Network Mapping and Functional Decoding \n  \nThe activated brain regions following acupuncture on ST36 were mapped on the large-scale functional network atlas, showing that the majority of voxels mapped to the auditory network, anterior salience network, and posterior salience network, and some small regions were mapped to the visuospatial network, language network, and dorsal default-mode network (DMN). To further decipher the functional effects of ST36 acupuncture, a neurosynth decoding analysis was performed. As shown in  , which depicts the functional profiles, acupuncture on ST36 was associated with SII stimulation, such as pain, touch, tactile, and electrical stimulation; sound and language processing, such as auditory sensory and speech; and mood regulation ( ).

Studies have shown that acupuncture of ST36 induces multiple activations of relevant brain regions, including the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, postcentral and cingulate gyri, insula, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and other limbic systems ( ,  ), but the results were based on relatively small sample size and heterogeneous. The present work is a meta-analysis summarizing task-based fMRI studies of ST36 acupuncture in healthy individuals. The pooled results showed the opercular part of IFG. R, STG. L, and MCG. R regions were positively activated following ST36 acupuncturing, and no negative activations were detected. Functional network mappings of the identified clusters revealed that the activated areas were located in the auditory network, anterior salience network, and posterior salience network. Further functional decoding implied that our findings may help to elucidate the neural targets of acupuncture at ST36 for pain, speech, and mood disorder management. \n\nStomach 36 has been an important acupoint for improving gastrointestinal function and enhancing physical fitness since ancient China. ST36 is located in the tibialis anterior muscle four fingers beneath the lower patella margin and one finger aside from the anterior border of the tibia and is thought to strengthen the spleen and stomach, relax the meridians, activate collaterals, and strengthen the body in Chinese medicine theory. ST36 acupuncture is popular for analgesia, cognitive function and cerebral circulation improvement, and gastrointestinal disease regulation in modern practices. Studies on cerebral infarction patients and animal models have reported that acupuncture at ST36 improves brain metabolites and memory function and promotes motor function, indicating neural and cognitive recovery promoting the effects of acupuncture ( ,  ). Moreover, acupuncture at ST36 has neuroprotective effects in hydrocephalus infantile rats, exhibiting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects   via   inhibition of reactive astrogliosis ( ). \n\nIn the present study, we mainly focused on temporal brain activities following an acupuncture session. We found that acupuncture at ST36 positively activates the opercular part of IFG. R, STG. L, and MCG. R, which is consistent with the conclusions of another meta-analysis that reported brain activations following acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation in subjects with varying background health situations ( ). The clusters of the opercular part of IFG. R and STG. L were stable in jackknife analysis, indicating the robust activation of these regions during ST36 acupuncturing. The IFG and STG regions, involved in the classic Wernicke\u2013Lichtheim\u2013Geschwind language processing model ( ), are the important components of the auditory network that are in line with the results in large-scale network mapping and functional decoding analysis. Part of the human ability to comprehend syntax and syntactic processing, as well as overall language comprehension seems to be located in the IFG ( ). The STG is primarily responsible for processing sound and is also involved in processing the emotional meaning derived from facial expressions ( ). The auditory network, consisting of the IFG, STG, and adjacent insula, plays an important role in language and interaction with the environment ( ). However, there are limited reports on the relationships between acupuncture at ST36 and the auditory network, and the clinical applications of acupuncture in language disorders should be explored. \n\nThe activated regions also extend to bilateral insular areas that involve pain processing ( ). Interestingly, it has been reported that the insular\/opercular area is one of the strongest activated regions in thermal stimulation and electrostimulation and positively responds to stimulation intensity during electrostimulation ( ,  ). The brain area associated with somatic nociception and central neuroendocrine system regulation is inhibited after acupuncture at ST36 ( ). Multiple limbic system regions, mid-inferior occipital gyrus, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus with altered long-term simultaneous activities after ST36 acupuncture associated with sensation and pain, are found in the studies ( ,  ), which implies that the modes of action to the central nervous system for acupuncture analgesia may be time-dependent. Further research is needed to elucidate the short- and long-term mechanisms of acupuncture. \n\nThe MCG together with the parahippocampal gyrus are the important components of the limbic lobe with the functional of emotion processing and short- or long-term memory conversion ( ). However, the cluster in the MCG was unrobust in jackknife analysis after the removal of the results from the study of Napadow   et al  . ( ), which introduced EA stimulation at ST36. Although we did not identify significant heterogeneity among clusters, EA treatment could be a potential source of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses for MA and EA stimulation were performed separately. The results revealed that the extent of activation in brain regions after EA stimulation was much greater than that after MA stimulation, indicating that different neural mechanisms may underlie EA and MA during acupuncture. A study showed that electrical stimulation at other acupoints generated different activation patterns ( ), indicating that acupoint-specific activations may exist. However, Jin   et al  . ( ) blocked the local sensation with lidocaine infiltration subcutaneously in healthy subjects before MA, resulting in an attenuation of the activated regions without anesthesia, indicating that cutaneous sensation (  deqi   feelings) may be the major aspect of stimulation that generates brain activation. The effects of ST36 on gastrointestinal diseases have been frequently reported ( ,  ). One of the included studies showed that the oscillated secretion of gastric-related peripheral humoral factors is accompanied by hypothalamus activation in healthy subjects during EA stimulation ( ). However, the pooled results and the subgroup analysis results did not show hypothalamus activity alteration, which may be due to complex gut\u2013brain regulations that remained unclear. Additionally, subgroup analysis of control procedures revealed activation patterns similar to those following verum acupuncture. As the subgroup analysis results could not be directly compared, whether most of the acupuncture effect comes from electrical (or cutaneous) stimulations is still unknown. \n\nWe screened five studies reporting the intragroup comparison results of acupuncture vs. control for subgroup analysis to explore the ST36-specific activation of brain regions during acupuncture. The results showed that the activation of a small area located on the right supramarginal gyrus is specific to ST36 acupuncture. However, the findings conflict with the result that the regions that are specific to ST36 acupuncturing partially overlapped with the control stimulation pooled results. Moreover, based on the relationship between the group activations and the baseline, four activation modes can be observed in intragroup comparisons of task-based fMRI studies, namely, hyperactivations (treatment > control in task > baseline), hypo-activations (treatment < control in task > baseline), failures of deactivation (treatment < control in task < baseline), and hyperactivation (treatment > control in task < baseline) ( ,  ), but the studies included in the subgroup analysis provide no information on the accurate activation mode, and we simply regarded the results as hyperactivation and failures of deactivation in the subgroup analysis. Thus, the result should be interpreted with caution. \n\nAcupuncture treatment sessions generally take 5 to 40 min; hence, the relationship between needle retention time and brain activity is another important interest in the present work. Positive brain activation was found in the left olfactory cortex that positively correlated with needle retention time. Research has linked the association between acupuncture and olfactory regions. A canine model study has shown the left olfactory peduncle activation after postanesthesia acupuncture at BL60 (  Kunlun  ) ( ). Acupuncture at Li4 (  Hegu  ) and Li20 (  Yingxiang  ), as well as other acupoints, showed to improve olfactory sensitivity in healthy subjects ( ) and postinfectious smell loss patients ( ). Although olfactory dysfunction is one of the initial symptoms that appear years before motor symptoms and cognitive decline in several neurodegenerative diseases ( ,  ), studies have tested the activation effects of acupuncture at ST36 to the left olfactory cortex on Alzheimer's animal models ( ,  ), and clinical evidence on ST36 acupuncture effects in the olfactory cortex is still lacking. Our findings indicated that prolonged needle retention time during acupuncture at ST36 may strengthen the activation of the left olfactory cortex in healthy subjects, and thorough probe investigations into the clinical implications of this exploratory result may be required. \n\nThe mapping of acupuncture ST36-activated brain regions to a large-scale functional network atlas shows that most voxels map to auditory networks, the anterior salience network, and the posterior salience network, as well as the visuospatial network, language network, and dorsal DMN. The functional decoding results suggested that the activated regions were involved in pain, SII, electrical stimulation, auditory sensory and speech, and mood regulation. A study reported consistent results that acupuncture at ST36 produced the activation in the somatosensory area, insula, and the median cingulate cortex but deactivation in DMN areas ( ). You   et al  . ( ) reported alterations in DMN hub configurations following acupuncture at ST36. A meta-analysis of acupuncture for low back pain revealed that the brain regions involved in acupuncture were located in the salience network, DMN, pain matrix, and descending pain modulatory system ( ), demonstrating the analgesic effect of acupuncture. The DMN is associated with several advanced cognitive functions; the salience network mediates the switching between the DMN and the central executive network, and those three networks are theoretically the core \u201ctriple networks\u201d in cognition. The modulator interactions between the \u201ctriple networks\u201d following acupuncture at ST36 need further investigation. \n\nNotably, no SI area activation was observed in our pooled results, which may be inconsistent with some previous acupuncture fMRI results. Activations in SI have been reported in the included acupuncture studies ( ,  ). However, another included study demonstrated decreased activities in the SI and SII, which might be due to ST36 inhibited or modulated pain sensory for analgesic effects ( ). A recent study showed the activations in SI and SII, insula, and thalamus region during sponge scrubbing, whereas the SI region did show activation during real acupuncture at Li4 (Hegu) ( ). Another study reported evidence of functional diversity within SI that higher SI activation was found in the anticipation phase (a visual cue to inform participants that pain would be delivered) and lower activation in pain stimulation, indicating the differences in attentional and sensory pain processing ( ). In our results, SII activation was observed and agreed with the frequently reported results, indicating that acupuncture may involve complex sensory processing. Nonetheless, the somatosensory and analgesic mechanism for acupuncture at ST36 remains to be further researched. \n\nThe present study had the following limitations. First, the number of included studies and the total number of involved participants were relatively small. Second, the present meta-analysis did not study the effects of   deqi   sensations which are believed to be a key factor in the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Although the acupuncture sensation scale ( ), the Massachusetts General Hospital acupuncture sensation scale ( ), and the Southampton needle sensation questionnaire ( ) were introduced and validated, inconsistencies in the evaluation of   deqi   sensations were found across the included studies, and it was difficult to precisely define the intensities of   deqi   sensations in the present meta-analysis. Universal tools for quantifying the   deqi   phenomenon may be of value in further research. Third, there is a relatively large publication year span of the included studies. Techniques and software have been substantially updated, which may introduce inestimable heterogeneity to the results. Forth, despite in most experimental paradigms, the needles were inserted into the skin before the scan and stayed in place throughout the scan session, the effects of the needle penetrating the skin were ignored. The needle retention time for the meta-regression was only considered as one stimulation period or plus the following non-resting state period but not the full length of the session. Specific experimental paradigms and analysis workflow considering for the nature of the acupuncture therapeutic effects may be needed in further studies. Fifth, the included studies tested different stimulations on the same subjects, and the design inevitably faces the concerns of selection bias and incomplete washout periods. A randomized controlled design with a larger sample size should be adopted in future research. Sixth, the MINORS scores of the included studies were below the recommended cutoff for comparison studies, suggesting methodological defects in the studies. However, considering the specialized designs, developing a new assessment tool for comprehensive methodological evaluation of task-based fMRI studies may be a solution. Finally, this study examined acupuncture-specific brain activation. Because of the relatively small sample size of included studies and unclarified mode of activation in the two-sample comparisons, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, acupuncture-specific brain activity is an important topic that warrants rigorous clinical studies and experimental validations. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals mainly activates three clusters located in the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. EA stimulation may expand the activated brain regions. The needle retention time during an acupuncture session may enhance the activation of the left olfactory cortex. Our findings facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment and provide neurological evidence for the clinical implications of acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nHH, XY, and XH performed data analyses and wrote the main manuscript.

However, the available evidence on such deficits is inconsistent. To further illustrate the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety disorder, the present meta-analysis summarizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for cognitive reappraisal tasks and investigates related brain areas. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive series of meta-analyses of cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies contrasting patients with anxiety disorder with healthy control (HC) subjects, employing an anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping approach. We also conducted a subgroup analysis of medication status, anxiety disorder subtype, data-processing software, and MRI field strengths. Meta-regression was used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics. Eight studies, with 11 datasets including 219 patients with anxiety disorder and 227 HC, were identified. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with HC, patients with anxiety disorder showed relatively decreased activation of the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), bilateral parietal cortex, and left fusiform gyrus during cognitive reappraisal. The subgroup analysis, jackknife sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and Egger\u2019s tests further confirmed these findings. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nImpaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder may be the consequence of hypo-activation of the prefrontoparietal network, consistent with insufficient top-down control. Our findings provide robust evidence that functional impairment in prefrontoparietal neuronal circuits may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnxiety disorders are globally a very common and disabling group of mental disorders, ,  the cause of particularly high economic burden and clinically significant personal distress.  Many studies have sought to understand the neural basis of how pathological anxiety is triggered and maintained. Using emotion regulation questionnaires, psychological studies have indicated that anxiety disorders may entail impaired emotion regulation. ,  Models of anxiety have highlighted that impaired regulation of negative affectivity plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, ,  explaining the onset and maintenance of anxiety. \n\nConsequently, a clear understanding of the neural systems underlying emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders is important for identifying biological targets to improve the specificity and efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorder. \n\nEmotion regulation has been conceptualized as the process by which individuals modify the expression, experience, and physiology of their emotions.  According to models of emotion regulation, the most studied strategy is cognitive reappraisal, a type of antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategy that is achieved by altering one\u2019s interpretation or appraisal of affective events. ,  Cognitive reappraisal has been proven to be a high-efficiency way of regulating affect and physiological arousal,  costing less in terms of cognitive resource ,  compared with response-focused strategies (eg, expressive suppression) and having longer-lasting effects than attention-focused strategies (eg, distraction). ,  First-line intervention approaches to mental disorder (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) are closely related to cognitive reappraisal.  Therefore, a better understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive reappraisal is crucial for translating basic and translational advances into clinical application. \n\nIn the past decades, the rapid growth of literature on fMRI neuroimaging studies has focused on neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal. , ,  A well-known behavior and fMRI study demonstrated that cognitive reappraisal resulted in prefrontal cortex responses and decreased negative emotion ratings in healthy control (HC).  Recently, three meta-analyses showed that implementing cognitive reappraisal consistently activates a large regulatory network, including the high activated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dmPFC, dACC, vmPFC, SMA, and inferior\/superior parietal cortex, as well as the hypo-activated amygdala and insula, during emotion down-regulation. , , ,  This demonstrates that conscious cognitive reappraisal recruits a classic frontoparietal control network to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala. , ,  Although most previous cognitive reappraisal studies of healthy individuals describe a consistent neural regulatory network, whether and how these substrates differ in individuals with anxiety disorders remains poorly understood. \n\nRecent investigations have begun to fill in these gaps, finding that impaired cognitive reappraisal of emotion is observable across anxiety disorders.  Compared with healthy individuals, patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been found to show less consistent activation of the dmPFC and dACC when down-regulating negative images using reappraisal. \u2013  Elsewhere, a study of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found less dlPFC activation in patients compared with HC during cognitive reappraisal.  Such findings show impaired top-down control of the prefrontal cortex during emotion regulation in patients with anxiety disorder. However, not all are entirely consistent. For example, one study using a similar task paradigm for SAD conversely showed increased activation of the dlPFC.  Furthermore, another recent study found no significant differences in frontoparietal activity during reappraisal between groups of SAD patients and healthy participants.  As this demonstrates, while there is some understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders it has become increasingly difficult to aggregate and synthesize neuroimaging findings to reach conclusive agreement. Instead, further brain regions have been found to be associated with anxiety disorders (eg, the SMA and parietal cortex).  One the one hand, anxiety disorder is often accompanied by multiple psychological and physical symptoms whose neural mechanisms cannot be explained by abnormalities in a single brain region.  On the other, small and heterogeneous samples and substantial methodological differences between studies are likely to generate false positive results,  while consistent results obtained by independent studies from different research groups are relatively robust. A comprehensive quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) of the results of multiple studies to obtain convergent experimental evidence could therefore be hugely beneficial.  Hence, this study attempts to locate the core cognitive neuropsychology mechanisms that are specific to anxiety disorder, based on a meta-analysis of the extant literature. \n\nTo our knowledge, only one study has previously performed a meta-analysis of cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies in populations of patients with mood and anxiety disorders.  However, in that study, only four studies of patients with anxiety disorder were investigated. Other subtypes of anxiety disorder, such as GAD or panic disorder (PD), were not included. Thus, the findings cannot be generalized to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were combined in the sample of Pic\u00f3-P\u00e9rez et al.  Two recent reviews have shown major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders to have different disorder-specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation  involving cognitive reappraisal.  For example, a malfunction of the dlPFC is more predictive of and specific to depression disorder (relative to anxiety disorders) with an inability to down-regulate emotion reactions,  while reduced activity of the dACC is specific to anxiety disorders during down-regulation of negative emotion.  Further, other potentially influential factors, such as anxiety disorder subtype, data-processing software, and MRI field strengths, were not considered in the prior meta-analysis. Therefore, the core neural mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal underlying anxiety disorders remain unclear. Since further original cognitive reappraisal studies of anxiety disorders have been published in recent years, it is worthwhile performing an updated fMRI meta-analysis to investigate the abnormal brain activity underlying reappraisal and to explore other clinical profiles of alterations in brain function. \n\nThus, the goals of this study were threefold. First, we conducted a pooled meta-analysis to identify the most prominent and replicable brain regions of impaired cognitive reappraisal in patients with anxiety disorders. To do this we used anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) software \u2013 a newly developed meta-analytic method with increased specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of analyses \u2013 taking reported peak coordinates, statistical parametric maps, or both from original articles to reconstruct effect-size maps of the differences between patients and controls.  With this method, unlike other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches such as ALE,  both positive and negative coordinates are recreated on the same map, which is a significant feature that prevents a particular voxel from erroneously appearing to be positive and negative at the same time.  Second, subgroup meta-analyses were conducted to explore the heterogeneity and robustness of the main results. Specifically, we performed subgroup meta-analyses to compare treatment-naive\/medicine-free anxiety disorder patients with HC. A stratified meta-analysis of the subtype of anxiety disorders was subsequently conducted. We also conducted subgroup meta-analyses on data-processing software (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages [AFNI]) and MRI field strengths (3.0 T). Third, meta-regression analyses assessed the effects of gender and other relevant clinical profiles, such as age and comorbidity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategies \n  \nA comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify functional magnetic resonance imaging literature on anxiety disorders, published before September 2017 and including \u201cin press\u201d articles. The search keywords were \u201cpanic disorder,\u201d \u201cagoraphobia,\u201d \u201cspecific phobia,\u201d \u201csocial phobia,\u201d \u201csocial anxiety disorder,\u201d \u201cSAD,\u201d \u201cposttraumatic stress disorder,\u201d \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d \u201cPTSD,\u201d \u201cobsessive compulsive disorder,\u201d \u201cobsessive-compulsive disorder,\u201d \u201cOCD,\u201d \u201cacute stress disorder,\u201d \u201cgeneralized anxiety disorder,\u201d \u201cgeneralized anxiety,\u201d \u201cGAD,\u201d and \u201canxiety,\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d and \u201cfunctional MRI,\u201d as well as \u201creappraisal\u201d and \u201ccognitive reappraisal.\u201d The reference lists of the identified trials and review articles were also manually checked to identify any other relevant papers. \n\n\n### Study eligibility criteria \n  \nWe considered studies that compared the blood oxygen level dependent responses of patients with anxiety disorder with those of HC, when performing a reappraisal task. In this kind of task, participants undergo fMRI during a cognitive reappraisal task that requires them to reappraise (ie, reduce) or maintain emotional responses to affective pictures (eg, a negative picture). The affective pictures come from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)  or other databases. The contrasts of interest are the comparison of two conditions (reappraise and maintain) between clinical and healthy participants. Articles were included in the meta-analysis if they also met the following criteria: (1) patients in the studies had an anxiety disorder that met the criteria of the fourth edition of the   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   (DSM-IV);  (2) the articles were published in a peer-reviewed journal; (3) whole-brain analyses were applied to both patients and HC; (4) the results of whole-brain analyses were reported; (5) significant thresholds for data were used that were corrected for multiple comparisons. The corresponding authors of the studies qualifying for inclusion were contacted by email for additional information. \n\nArticles were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) anxiety disorder patients were not compared with HC; (2) they were conference abstracts or reviews; (3) they only reported region of interest results instead of whole-brain findings; (4) task activation analyses using the fMRI method were not used; (5) either the patient or HC group included \u226410 patients; and (6) where the same patient group was used in different publications, only the study with the largest sample was included. \n\n\n### Quality assessment and data extraction \n  \nWe performed the literature searches, reviewed the retrieved articles, and extracted and cross-checked data. All the studies included were quality-assessed using a 12-point checklist ( ) that focused on both the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study samples and the imaging-specific methodology used. This checklist was based on a prior meta-analytic study ,  that looked at structural MRI measures, but its critical variables are also significant for assessing task-based fMRI studies. Where inconsistent results were obtained, they were discussed and resolved by consensus review. For all studies entered into the meta-analysis, name of first author, publication year, basic demographic information (sample size, age, gender, and percentage of females), patient data (symptom severity, percentage of comorbidity, medication status), task stimulus material, data-processing method, MRI parameters, and three-dimensional coordinates, were extracted according to the AES-SDM method. \n\n\n### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nRegional differences in activation between patients and HC during fMRI tasks were identified in the selected studies using AES-SDM software in a standard process. Systematic whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness (specifically the sensitivity) of the results. Using this method, where a previously significant brain region remains significant in all or most of the combinations of studies, it can be concluded that the finding is highly replicable.  Recognizing the possible influence of medication status, subtype of anxiety disorder, and methodological differences between studies, we then performed several subgroup meta-analyses including medicine-naive patients, patients with SAD, patients with GAD and SAD, data processing software (AFNI), and MRI field strengths (3.0 T). Given the variability that exists in treatment status, we defined the sample of medicine-naive patients as participants who had been free of psychotropic medication for at least two months before the scan. \n\nAll the above analytical processes were performed on the selected studies using AES-SDM software, ,  which has previously been used with psychiatric patients ,  and is described in detail elsewhere. ,  Briefly, we used a relatively wide full-width at half-maximum (FWHM; 20 mm) to assign indicators of proximity to the reported three-dimensional coordinates, as this can optimally balance sensitivity and specificity in the AES-SDM.  We employed the standard threshold (  p  <0.005 with peak   Z  >1, extent threshold of clusters >10 voxels) as recommended by the AES-SDM software developers. This is proposed to optimally balance the sensitivity and specificity of results and to be an approximate equivalent to corrected   p  -value=0.05 (indeed 0.025) in AES-SDM for the effect-size used. This method showed adequate sensitivity and excellent control of false positive results (~2.5%) compared with other meta-analytical procedures.  Significant clusters obtained from AES-SDM analysis were overlaid on an MRIcron high-resolution brain template for display purposes.  Publication bias was assessed using Egger\u2019s test, as implemented in the AES-SDM software (version 5.141). \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias analysis \n  \nWe examined the statistical (between-studies) heterogeneity of clusters using a random effects model with Q statistics (chi-square distribution converted to z values and tested with both permutations,   p  <0.005, cluster extent=10 voxels). Moreover, the possibility of publication bias associated with brain regions activated differently during reappraisal between patients and HC was examined using Egger\u2019s test. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analysis \n  \nSome basic demographic and clinical information, such as the percentage of female patients, the percentage of comorbidity, sample size, mean age, race (white), and symptom severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Rated and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were entered into the regression analysis to investigate their association with regional differences in activation between patients and HC during cognitive reappraisal. The main output for each variable above was the map of the regression slope. As described in previous meta-analytic studies, we set a more conservative probability threshold (  p  <0.0005) in order to reduce detection of spurious relationships as much as possible. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nThe search strategy described in the methods section yielded a total of 47 studies. Of these, eight studies, , \u2013 , \u2013  with 11 relevant patients vs HC comparisons, ultimately met the inclusion criteria. In total they included 219 patients with anxiety disorder (70 GAD, 36 PD, 14 PTSD, 82 SAD, 17 comorbid SAD\/GAD), and 227 HC. In eight studies, one study contained a down-regulate negative and positive affect,  other studies only included a down-regulate negative affect. One study  that found no significant differences between SAD patients and HC during a cognitive reappraisal task was also included \u2013 in this case we used a textfile named \u201cGaebler.no_peaks\u201d in order to report no activation peaks for a given contrast, as described in the meta-analysis tutorial. , ,  Patients with anxiety disorder and HC in the studies included were generally comparable in terms of age and gender. Regarding medication status, four studies with five relevant patients vs HC comparisons included patients undergoing treatment or who had undergone a \u201cwashout\u201d less than two months before the scan.   presents a flow diagram showing how we identified relevant studies.   summarizes the clinical and demographic data from all the enrolled studies. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of functional brain abnormalities during reappraisal in anxiety disorder \n  \nThe results from the AES-SDM analysis are summarized in   and  . After correcting for multiple comparisons, compared with HC, patients with anxiety disorder showed significantly decreased activity during cognitive reappraisal in (1) the bilateral dmPFC (bilateral superior frontal gyrus, Brodmann area [BA] 9\/32) and extending into the bilateral dACC (bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal BA 24\/32) and bilateral SMA (bilateral supplementary motor area, medial BA 6); (2) the left inferior parietal; (3) the right superior parietal gyrus; (4) the left amygdala; (5) the left fusiform gyrus; and (6) the left vmPFC (middle frontal gyrus, medial BA 11). Definitions of the dmPFC and dACC can be found in previous reviews. ,  However, we detected no significantly enhanced activity during reappraisal in patients with anxiety disorder compared with HC. \n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nA whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the replicability of the findings of the pooled meta-analysis. As shown in  , the results indicate that the decreased activation in the dmPFC, dACC, SMA and left inferior parietal was highly replicable, preserved as it was throughout all 11 combinations of studies. Results for the left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus remained significant in all but one combination, while those for the right superior parietal gyrus were significant in all but two combinations. Detailed results are listed in  . \n\n\n### Subgroup meta-analyses \n  \nGiven the possible influence of medication status, subtype of anxiety disorder, and methodological differences between studies, several subgroup meta-analyses were performed. As shown in   and  , these analyses suggest that the above results remained largely unchanged. In the subgroup of studies using 3.0 T MRI (eight datasets), all clusters in the combined analysis remained significant except for the right superior parietal gyrus. In the subgroup of studies using AFNI software (seven datasets), all clusters in the combined analysis remained significant except for the left amygdala and left middle frontal gyrus. In the subgroup of medication-naive patients (six datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left inferior parietal, right superior parietal gyrus, and left fusiform gyrus remained significant. In the subgroup of SAD (five datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left amygdala, and right superior parietal gyrus remained significant. In the subgroup of both GAD and SAD (eight datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left inferior parietal, left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus and right superior parietal gyrus remained significant. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity analysis and publication bias \n  \nAn analysis of heterogeneity revealed that a few regions with altered activation (left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus) showed significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (  p  <0.005). No strong evidence for publication bias was revealed by Egger\u2019s test (  p  >0.05), except for the left amygdala (  p  =0.006). \n\nAs the left amygdala was absent in two of the five subgroup analyses, and showed a significant heterogeneity and publication bias, we excluded it from the core brain region contributing to impaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorders. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nAs shown in  , the percentage of female patients had a positive relationship with activation in the right fusiform gyrus (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate:   x  =20,   y  =\u221264,   z  =\u221212; AES-SDM value=2.369,   p  =0.000125587; 77 voxels). However, this result should be interpreted with caution as it is based on only three studies. Percentage of comorbidity, sample size, and mean age of patients with anxiety disorder were not associated with decreased brain regions. Race (white) and symptom severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Rated and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) could not be explored because only six and five datasets respectively were available from the studies included. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe believe that this is the first study to independently explore regional neurofunctional activation and simultaneously investigate subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses in patients with anxiety disorder (including most subtypes) during cognitive reappraisal. First, the pooled meta-analysis identified significantly decreased activity during cognitive reappraisal in the bilateral dmPFC, bilateral dACC, bilateral SMA, bilateral parietal cortex, left vmPFC, and left fusiform gyrus in patients with anxiety disorder compared with HC. Second, subgroup analyses indicated that the above findings remained largely unchanged. The robustness of the main findings was further demonstrated by the jackknife sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and Egger tests. Finally, meta-regression analysis showed that activation in the right fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with percentage of female patients. These findings suggest that impaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder may be the consequence of hypo-activation in the prefrontal cortex, dACC, and parietal cortex during emotion regulation, consistent with insufficient top-down control. \n\nThe most common finding of the current study was decreased activation in the bilateral dmPFC of patients with anxiety disorder during cognitive reappraisal. A large number of cognitive reappraisal studies have shown that healthy individuals can activate the dmPFC to achieve successful emotion regulation,  whereas here dmPFC activation was lower in patients with anxiety disorder during reappraisal. According to the results of cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire and behavioral research, anxiety disorder had impaired cognitive emotion regulation strategies involving cognitive reappraisal. ,  Neuroimaging studies have found that decreased dmPFC activity in anxiety disorder might be associated with reduced emotion regulation capability.  Furthermore, studies of healthy adults have found that activation in the dmPFC is associated with perceiving one\u2019s affective states ,  and self-related processing.  A previous meta-analysis examining large samples of healthy subjects in cognitive reappraisal studies has suggested that the dmPFC may support semantic and self-reflective processes relevant to elaborating the meaning of affective stimuli or drawing inferences about one\u2019s emotional state.  According to the findings discussed above, one possible explanation for the decreased dmPFC is that patients are unable to recruit the dmPFC to assist in monitoring and reflecting on the meaning of altering their affective states during reappraisal, and that this contributes to a reduced ability to down-regulate negative reactivity. Thus, insufficient recruitment of dmPFC activity could be an important neural correlate of emotion regulation deficits in anxiety disorder. \n\nComparing patients with anxiety disorder and HC during reappraisal revealed clusters of decreased activity in the dmPFC and extending into the dACC and SMA. The dACC lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes and plays a significant role in regulating top-down cognitive control and assigning appropriate control to other areas of the brain. ,  The dACC has also been recognized as a key region of the emotion-regulation network, , ,  which is thought to mediate several functions including monitoring for conflict and detecting the likelihood of error commission, particularly involving attentional and executive control during the appraisal of negative emotion. , ,  Poor emotion regulation may involve impaired attention control. Theories based on cognitive and neuroscience research have indicated that deficient attentional control is associated with anxiety. ,  A previous review also found that anxiety disorder shows impaired recruitment of the dACC during emotion regulation.  Consequently, our findings suggest that anxiety disorder has a reduced ability to recruit the dACC implicated in top-down attention control to engage the emotion-regulation network. In addition, the SMA has also been consistently implicated as a core region of the emotion-regulation network in healthy people, and is associated with successful down-regulation of negative emotion. ,  During reconceptualization (changing an appraisal) the pre-SMA may reflect the execution of this reconceptualization by reformulating mental representations through language and memory processing, with the anterior and posterior cluster of the SMA related to cognitive and executive aspects of motor behavior.  Thus, an impaired SMA may reflect reduced recruitment of the executive and cognitive aspects at different stages, which contributed to emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders. \n\nThe parietal cortex is one of the brain regions most commonly identified in fMRI studies of emotion regulation in anxiety disorders. ,  This brain region is a part of the frontoparietal control region  related to sensory information, with top-down response-related information to facilitate flexible, goal-directed behavior.  Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies have indicated that the parietal cortex is mainly involved in selective attention and might assist in holding reappraisals in mind. ,  Compared with HC, patients with PTSD have a reduced ability to recruit the parietal cortex, implicated in top-down attentional control in the affective number Stroop task.  In one structural neuroimaging study, the SAD patients showed increased cortical thickness in the frontoparietal network, which fitted with findings at a functional level showing frontoparietal networks to be associated with executive-controlling and attentional functions.  Together, these results indicate that abnormalities in the parietal cortex may result in the dysfunction of top-down attentional control in anxiety disorder. \n\nAnother brain region showing abnormally reduced activity during appraisal was the left vmPFC. Because direct connections between the frontoparietal control region and amygdala associated with emotional response are relatively sparse compared with connections between vmPFC and the amygdala,  frontoparietal areas are likely to influence the amygdala indirectly by modulating activity in the vmPFC. ,  Based on animal and human research, vmPFC plays an important role in fear extinction and appraisal of negative emotion. ,  A prominent neurobiological model of the vmPFC highlights top-down inhibition of the amygdala through the vmPFC as a crucial neural mechanism that may be defective in certain mood and anxiety disorders.  Therefore, it might be speculated that patients with anxiety disorder cannot recruit the vmPFC through frontoparietal areas, in turn modulating the emotional response of the amygdala. \n\nBesides cognitive and attentional regions, the left fusiform gyrus was found to have decreased functional activation in anxiety disorder during reappraisal. The fusiform gyrus is associated with the perception of affective stimuli.  Commonly used emotion stimuli for probing neurobiological responses to cognitive reappraisal mainly come from the IAPS  and involve face stimuli.  During emotional face processing, healthy samples show greater neural activity in the fusiform gyrus,  while highly anxious individuals show impaired ability to process emotional faces.  Furthermore, SAD patients show significantly weaker activation in the left fusiform gyrus for emotional face perception, as compared with HC.  Emotion perception is a significant part of emotion regulation; meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis has shown the bilateral fusiform gyrus to be involved in cognitive emotion regulation.  Thus, our findings suggest that an impaired fusiform gyrus may be an important neural correlate in anxiety disorders of cognitive emotion dysregulation. Notably, the meta-regression analysis identified a positive association between percentage of female patients and activation of the right fusiform gyrus. Female patients with anxiety disorder seem to have distinct neurobiological underpinnings compared with male patients.  A previous neuroimaging study reported that the fusiform gyrus showed increased activity in females with stress compared with males with stress, when perceiving emotional faces.  This result might reflect the fact that female patients with anxiety disorder have less difficulty recognizing and distinguishing emotions compared with male patients with anxiety disorder. \n\nHowever, heterogeneity analysis showed that there was significant, unexplained between-study variability concerning the left vmPFC and left fusiform gyrus. In our meta-analytic study, besides heterogeneity analysis, we also attempted to control the quality of the studies included by applying strict selection criteria and performing jackknife sensitivity analysis, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression analyses in order to reduce heterogeneity as much as possible. Although the left vmPFC and left fusiform gyrus showed significant heterogeneity, a quantitative assessment, as measured by Egger\u2019s test, was not significant. The jackknife sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the findings. Therefore, in our view, these two brain regions remain significant in our meta-analysis. \n\nInterestingly, while our meta-analytic study found an abnormal neural network contributing to impaired cognitive emotion regulation, an altered dlPFC, typically found in cognitive reappraisal, ,  was not found. The dlPFC has been proposed to play an important role in cognitive emotion regulation.  This brain area was cognitive control center is related to action inhibition, working memory, reasoning, and social cognition.  There are some explanations for the non-significant changes in the dlPFC in the present meta-analysis. First, although the dlPFC is a significant part of the frontoparietal control network, a flexible and superordinate system supporting adaptive behavioral control, ,  different brain regions of the frontoparietal network have shared and unique functions across a broad range of cognitive demands.  Normal activation in the dlPFC may not be affected because of help from other brain areas of the frontoparietal network. Behavior studies have shown that patients with anxiety disorder can successfully down-regulate their negative emotion, ,  which may be in line with the above putative mechanism by which the activity of the dlPFC is not affected. Second, although in their review Zilverstand et al  reported abnormal activity in the dlPFC in anxiety disorders, they did not conduct a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive description of the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, some of the articles in their review did not have sufficient statistical power. For example, the article reported decreased activity in the dlPFC in anxiety disorder compared with HC during reappraisal on the basis of a comparison of group differences, and no task effect or group \u00d7 task interactions were found in the prefrontal cortex. \n\nCompared with the study of Pic\u00f3-P\u00e9rez et al,  decreased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and increased activation in insula, cerebellum, precentral and inferior occipital gyri were not observed in our study. These findings could be explained by two aspects. First, the vlPFC may support selection and inhibition of appropriate appraisals.  As a significant part of the limbic network, the insula is critically involved in the perception and encoding of aversive stimuli.  Previous systematic reviews suggested that dysfunction of lateral prefrontal cortex was predictive and specific to depression disorder  and major depressive patients could not recruit lateral prefrontal cortical region (ie, vlPFC) to attenuate activity in the limbic network during cognitive reappraisal.  In addition, relative to anxiety disorders, enhanced responses of limbic system during downregulation of emotion were specific findings to major depressive disorder.  Second, enhanced responses of limbic system contributed to excessive emotional processing and emotional experience, ,  the regions including cerebellum, precentral and inferior occipital gyri might be associated with the emotional experience.  Therefore, these regions that were not observed in our study might reflect specific deficits of major depressive disorder in neural mechanisms of emotion regulation. These findings could be useful in distinguishing anxiety disorder from major depression. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations to our study that should be highlighted. First, the number of fMRI studies included was small; the literature search yielded only eight studies with 11 relevant patients vs controls comparisons. This could affect the generalizability of our results, particularly in the subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regressions analyses. Second, our meta-analysis was based on coordinates from published studies rather than raw statistical maps, which might reduce its accuracy.  Third, the heterogeneity of the data acquisition and analysis techniques, including MRI field strengths, slice thickness, voxel size, and data-processing software, may reduce the accuracy of these results. Fourth, our meta-analysis included studies of medicine-naive patients who had undergone a medication washout period before scanning, so that longer-term influences of medication on brain function could not be completely excluded. Although we conducted a subgroup meta-analysis of the medicine-naive, these results should be interpreted with caution. Finally, some patients with anxiety disorder had co-morbid major depression. Anxiety and major depressive disorders may have different disorder-specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal. ,  Although the patients fulfilled our criteria for comorbid-major depression with anxiety disorder being the primary diagnosis, the influence of major depression cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we identified the most robust functional neuroimaging findings on cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder. The results demonstrated that patients with anxiety disorder could not recruit the prefrontoparietal network, including the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, vmPFC, and parietal cortex, to down-regulate their emotion response. Our findings provide robust evidence that impairment of prefrontoparietal neuronal circuits may play an important role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder. This finding may provide novel targets for medical or cognitive-behavioral interventions and neuromodulation approaches (eg, transcranial magnetic stimulation). With longitudinal data, future investigations should further explore whether these functional abnormities are associated with structural changes or influenced by disease severity and medication status. \n\n\n## Supplementary materials \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5953307,"text_md5":"2e4ff0604778fd1fa5ce61a4a42ac3b1","field_positions":{"authors":[0,150],"journal":[151,175],"publication_year":[177,181],"title":[192,333],"keywords":[347,464],"abstract":[477,2439],"body":[2448,38494]},"batch":2,"pmid":29785110,"doi":"10.2147\/NDT.S165677","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5953307","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5953307"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5953307\">5953307<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5953307  Prefrontoparietal dysfunction during emotion regulation in anxiety disorder: a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies"}
{"text":"Zinchenko, Oksana and Yaple, Zachary A. and Arsalidou, Marie\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nBrain Responses to Dynamic Facial Expressions: A Normative Meta-Analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\ndynamic faces\nfMRI meta-analysis\nactivation likelihood estimate\nsocial cognition\nfacial expressions\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nIdentifying facial expressions is crucial for social interactions. Functional neuroimaging studies show that a set of brain areas, such as the fusiform gyrus and amygdala, become active when viewing emotional facial expressions. The majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating face perception typically employ static images of faces. However, studies that use dynamic facial expressions (e.g., videos) are accumulating and suggest that a dynamic presentation may be more sensitive and ecologically valid for investigating faces. By using quantitative fMRI meta-analysis the present study examined concordance of brain regions associated with viewing dynamic facial expressions. We analyzed data from 216 participants that participated in 14 studies, which reported coordinates for 28 experiments. Our analysis revealed bilateral fusiform and middle temporal gyri, left amygdala, left declive of the cerebellum and the right inferior frontal gyrus. These regions are discussed in terms of their relation to models of face processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nEffective face processing is essential for perceiving and recognizing intentions, emotion and mental states in others. Facial expressions have traditionally been investigated by utilizing static pictures of faces as opposed to dynamic moving faces (i.e., short video clips). Faces elicit activity in an established set of brain areas that includes the fusiform gyri associated with face perception, amygdala associated with processing affect and fronto-temporal regions associated with knowledge of a person (Fusar-Poli et al.,   for meta-analyses). Some suggest that dynamic faces compared to static faces are more ecologically valid (Bernstein and Yovel,  ), and facilitate recognition of facial expressions (Ceccarini and Caudek,  ). O'Toole et al. ( ) explain that when both static and dynamic identity information are available, people tend to rely primarily on static information for face recognition (i.e., supplemental information hypothesis), whereas dynamic information such as motion contributes to the quality of the structural information accessible from a human face (representation enhancement hypothesis). This dynamic information plays a key role in social interactions when evaluating the mood or intentions of others (Langton et al.,  ; O'Toole et al.,  ). The brain areas that respond to dynamic faces are not fully characterized with up-to-date meta-analysis methods and findings in the field. The purpose of this study is to examine concordance in brain regions associated with dynamic facial expressions using quantitative meta-analysis. \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating face perception typically reveal activation within the fusiform gyrus and occipital gyrus, areas part of the core regions of face processing, which mediate visual analysis of faces (O'Toole et al.,  ; Gobbini and Haxby,  ). The extended system associated with extracting meaning from faces includes the inferior frontal cortex and amygdalae (Haxby et al.,  ). Notably, compared to static faces, much fewer fMRI studies use dynamic face stimuli, likely due to methodological and practical challenges in using dynamic faces. Specifically, short videos of faces need to be standardized in terms of presentation speed (i.e., how fast a neutral face transforms to an emotional expression), as this requires consistency across emotions. Similarly, morphed faces are modified to transform a static photo from a neutral to an emotional expression in a series of frames. Thus, adopting a protocol for using dynamic facial expressions (e.g., videos and morphs) requires more computational processing and in turn more time to prepare. \n\nThese additional efforts, however, have been found to be beneficial in populations that have an altered sensitivity to faces. For example, research shows that regions related to visual properties (i.e., the core system) and emotional\/cognitive processing of faces (i.e., the extended system) are hypoactive in patients with autism spectrum disorders (Hadjikhani et al.,  ; Bookheimer et al.,  ; Nomi and Uddin,   for review). Dynamic changes in facial expressions were used to show that individuals with and without autism spectrum disorders elicit equivalent activity in occipital regions, and differential activity in the fusiform gyrus, amygdala and superior temporal sulcus, suggesting a dysfunction in the relational and affective processing of faces (Pelphrey et al.,  ). Thus, in practice, usage of dynamic stimuli would be advantageous when studying populations with difficulties in processing faces and emotions. \n\nA recent review of the face perception literature adopted the model of core and extended systems to explain processing of dynamic faces in typical adults (Bernstein and Yovel,  ). This review provides support for a dorsal stream that encompasses the superior temporal sulcus, and encodes low-frequency information such as face motion, head rotation and processing of moving facial parts (O'Toole et al.,  ; Peyrin et al.,  ,  ,  ; Saxe,  ), and a ventral stream that comprises bilateral inferior occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and processes high-frequency information such as facial expressions and face parts (e.g., Eger et al.,  ; Iidaka et al.,  ; Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al.,  ). Since the dorsal stream processes more information about movement of faces, dynamic facial expressions should involve more activation of the superior temporal lobe. \n\nAn early meta-analysis analyzed coordinates from 11 experiments on dynamic facial expressions and identified concordance in temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices (Arsalidou et al.,  ). Since then, there has been an increase in the number of fMRI studies that examine brain responses to dynamic faces. Critically, there have been methodological advances to the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method (Turkeltaub et al.,  ) and documented implementation errors in the old ALE software that have since been corrected (Eickhoff et al.,  ); ALE software developers recommend re-analyses and evaluation of current and past meta-analyses. Thus, the purpose of the current paper was to examine brain areas associated with processing of dynamic facial expressions in healthy adults and establish their implication above and beyond to brain areas responding to static faces and other control tasks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search and article selection \n  \nA literature search was performed using Web of Science ( ) on October, 6th, 2017, keywords (\u201cdynamic faces\u201d OR \u201cfacial motion\u201d AND \u201cfMRI\u201d), years 1995\u20132017, yielding a total of 114 articles. Figure   shows the steps taken to identify eligible articles. Specifically, we excluded articles that: (1) reported no fMRI data; (2) studies that did not report whole brain analysis; (3) reported no data on healthy adults; (4) did not report fMRI coordinates and, (5) articles with irrelevant tasks. Articles surviving these criteria underwent a full text review by two researchers independently (O.Z. and Z.Y.). The remaining articles included healthy adults; reported stereotaxic coordinates in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space from random effects whole-brain analysis, which reported a contrast (i.e., experiment) comparing dynamic with static faces. Articles from a previous meta-analysis and an eligible study within it (Arsalidou et al.,  ) resulted in 7 additional articles. All relevant experiments from each article were included in the analysis because the most recent algorithm uses a correction to avoid summation of within-group effects and provides increased power (Turkeltaub et al.,  ). Table   shows participant demographics and details from a total 28 experiments from 14 articles, sorted by 15 separate subject groups, which were included in the meta-analysis. The number of experiments we included in the analysis adheres to current recommendations (  n   = 17\u201320) for achieving sufficient statistical power (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n  \nPRISMA flowchart for eligibility of articles (Template by Moher et al.,  ). \n    \nDescriptive information of studies and contrasts used in the meta-analyses. \n  \n n = sample size  ; \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE software (2.3.6), which relies on ALE, a coordinate-based meta-analytic method (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ) available at  . Foci from different articles were used to create a probabilistic map that compares the likelihood of activation compared to random spatial distribution. MNI coordinates were converted to Talairach space using the Lancaster et al. ( ) transformation. Significance was assessed using a cluster-level threshold for multiple comparisons at   p   = 0.05 with a cluster-forming threshold set to   p   = 0.001 (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ). GingerALE software does not provide an option for estimating replicability of the data, however, based on simulations of ALE analyses that have been performed to test sensitivity, number of incidental clusters and statistical power (Eickhoff et al.,  ), a recommended minimum number of experiments (  N   = 17\u201320) has been proposed (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Moreover, a cluster-level threshold sets the cluster minimum volume such that only, for example, 5% of the simulated data clusters exceed this size, minimizing the possibility that an ALE peak could be driven by only one study. \n\nThe majority of studies used tasks where participants were instructed to passively observe facial stimuli (Sato et al.,  ; Trautmann et al.,  ; Pent\u00f3n et al.,  ; Arsalidou et al.,  ) or to perform a simple target detection task (Pelphrey et al.,  ; Robins et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Sato et al.,  ). Two studies asked to rank the presented emotional expressions (Grosbras and Paus,  ; Sarkheil et al.,  ); three studies instructed the participants to make a decision about the gender of face stimuli (Hurlemann et al.,  ; Pent\u00f3n et al.,  ; Ceccarini and Caudek,  ); one study asked to rank the meaningfulness of moving faces and judge the fluidity of facial motions (Schultz et al.,  ); in another study participants were told to identify the category of face stimuli (LaBar et al.,  ); and in another study participants performed a one-back matching task (Schultz and Pilz,  ). Five articles reported experiments related to dynamic > static in various emotions: anger (LaBar et al.,  ; Grosbras and Paus,  ), fear (Sato et al.,  ), and happiness (Sato et al.,  ; Trautmann et al.,  ; Arsalidou et al.,  ). Six articles presented participants with dynamic > static faces after subtracting neutral from emotional faces in one (Hurlemann et al.,  ), several (Pelphrey et al.,  ; Robins et al.,  ; Schultz and Pilz,  ), or no emotional component (Lee et al.,  ; Pent\u00f3n et al.,  ). One article reported experiments regarding the morph intensity effect in dynamic faces (Sarkheil et al.,  ), and two articles contrasted dynamic faces to mosaic stimuli (Sato et al.,  ; we note that this study reported fMRI coordinates using magnetic encephalography-fMRI data reconstruction) or scrambled faces (Schultz et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAnalyses included data from 216 right-handed participants (27.24 \u00b1 9.02 years; 39.81% men, Table   for details). \n\n### ALE map \n  \nThe largest cluster with the highest ALE value was found in the right hemisphere and extended from the inferior temporal and occipital, to fusiform and superior temporal gyri (Figure  , Table  ).

Other areas included the left amygdala, and right inferior frontal gyrus. \n  \nRendered ALE map showing significant concordance across studies for dynamic facial expressions.

All coordinates are listed in Table  . \n    \nConcordant brain regions associated with dynamic facial expressions. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe examined concordance across studies in brain areas responding more to dynamic facial expressions. We report concordance in: (a) areas associated with the core visual system of processing faces such as fusiform gyrus and posterior parts of the superior temporal gyrus, (b) areas associated with the extended system for processing faces such as the left amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior parts of the superior temporal gyrus and (c) a cluster within the cerebellar declive, a region previously not highlighted in models of facial cognition. We build on previous models of face processing and discuss possible roles of these areas during the processing of dynamic faces. \n\nIn comparison with the previous meta-analysis on dynamic faces (Arsalidou et al.,  ); the current analysis yields similar brain regions, however the output resulted in less clusters that were larger in size and carried higher ALE values. When comparing the top clusters, the amygdala and cerebellar declive are found in the left hemisphere for both the current and previous analyses. Clusters in right precuneus (BA 7) and cuneus, and left hypothalamus, previously found to be concordant (Arsalidou et al.,  ), were not observed in the current meta-analysis; these areas had both lower ALE scores and smaller cluster volumes. We note three methodological choices that may account for differences in the current and previous meta-analyses; (a) the number of experiments included in the current meta-analyses is larger, which provide increased power, (b) the GingerALE algorithm, which allows for controlling for within-group effects and provides increased power (Turkeltaub et al.,  ) and (c) the thresholding approach follows cluster-level threshold for controlling for multiple comparisons, which is more suitable for ALE meta-analyses (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ). Critically, the current meta-analysis shows that the overall size of clusters in occipito-temporal regions is similar in the right and left hemisphere, suggesting bilateral engagement. \n\nSpecifically, bilateral occipito-temporal gyri comprise of the fusiform and superior temporal gyri, areas are most associated with face processing; the fusiform gyri are implicated in configuring relations among visual features and relying on high-spatial-frequency to form face percepts as a whole (e.g., Vuilleumier et al.,  ; Iidaka et al.,  ; Sabatinelli et al.,  ), or in part (e.g., Rossion et al.,  ; Nichols et al.,  ; Yaple et al.,  ). This is consistent with models that classify the fusiform gyrus as part of the core visual processing system for faces (Gobbini and Haxby,  ), and as part of the ventral stream of face processing (e.g., Bernstein and Yovel,  ). \n\nMoreover, we observe concordance in posterior and more dorsal parts of the superior temporal gyri. The superior temporal gyri are known for their involvement in the analysis of low-spatial frequency information (i.e., global facial information) such as gaze direction and motion associated with interpreting social signals (Allison et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Wegrzyn et al.,  ). According to the face perception model by Haxby and colleagues posterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus are part of the core visual face processing system responsible for basic visual analyses of faces, whereas adjacent more anterior parts of the superior temporal gyri are part of the extended system that is responsible for further processing of personal information (Haxby et al.,  ; Gobbini and Haxby,  ). Our data are also consistent with the more recent interpretation of a dorsal face processing pathway proposed by Bernstein and Yovel ( ). Importantly, consistent with the representation enhancement hypothesis (O'Toole et al.,  ) we propose that dynamic faces may show increased implication in superior temporal cortices because they provide richer input for the brain to interpret. \n\nAs part of the left occipito-temporal cluster we observed concordance in the cerebellar declive, an area not highlighted as part of face processing models. Traditionally, the cerebellum was known for its involvement in motor functioning. However, its role in cognitive and affective processing has been discussed (e.g., Brooks,  ; Paulin,  ; Doya,  ; Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) and a generic role in timing mechanisms has been proposed (e.g., Ivry and Spencer,  ). Past meta-analyses identify concordance in the cerebellum for static facial expressions (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ), however its role in social cognition remains unclear. In relation to social processes some have shown that the cerebellum is associated with mirroring and mentalizing motor actions (Van Overwalle et al.,  ,  ). We suggest that the cerebellum may play a role in tracking the sequences for conveying the signal and updating the information about perceptual features in a face to predict possible changes, similar to its involvement in the motor system. \n\nConcordance in the left amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus is respectively associated with emotional and cognitive processing of faces. The amygdala responds to all sorts of emotional stimuli such as fear processing and fear conditioning (LeDoux,  ), reward and punishment (Gupta et al.,  ). Growing evidence suggests that amygdala activation is not specific to fearful expressions or any particular emotion (van der Gaag et al.,  ), but rather it processes salient information of faces (Fitzgerald et al.,  ). It has been suggested that the amygdala contribute to social-emotional recognition (Adolphs et al.,  ; Adolphs and Spezio,  ) and processing of salient face stimuli during unpredictable situations (Adolphs,  ). Some have emphasized the evolutionary significance of the amygdalae, suggesting it plays a role in detecting relevant stimuli (Sander et al.,  ) and signaling potentially significant consequential events (Fitzgerald et al.,  ). Thus, based on past findings, perhaps the processing of dynamic faces requires increased amygdala activation due to an increased vigilance in observing the dynamically changing salient features of faces. \n\nThe inferior frontal gyrus, a part of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, is associated with all sorts of cognitive functions including response inhibition (Aron et al.,  ; Hampshire et al.,  ,  ), working memory (Yaple and Arsalidou,  ), negative priming (Yaple and Arsalidou,  ) and mental attention (Arsalidou et al.,  ). A hierarchical model of the prefrontal cortex suggests that the inferior frontal gyri would be responsible for simple, non-abstract judgments (Christoff et al.,  ). The majority of studies asked participants to make simple judgments about gender, emotion, or motion of faces congruent with this hypothesis. Regarding right lateralization, relevant to social interactions, the right inferior frontal gyrus is active when processing social information such as cooperative interaction (Liu et al.,  ) and interpersonal interactions (Liu et al.,  ). It has been shown that bilateral inferior frontal gyrus as a part of the dorsomedial network (Bzdok et al.,  ), which is involved in contemplation of others' mental states (Mar,   for meta-analysis). Alternatively, based on a trade-off between task difficulty and the mental-attentional capacity of the individual, the right hemisphere is hypothesized to be favored in simple, automatized processes (Pascual-Leone,  ; Arsalidou et al.,   for details). Overall, right inferior frontal gyrus's activation during face perception may be associated with cognitive processing of social information processing or maintaining with simple task requirements. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nData presented here represent concordance across fMRI studies that investigated dynamic vs. static facial expressions and across different emotional states. ALE methodological limitations have been discussed elsewhere (Zinchenko and Arsalidou,  ; Yaple and Arsalidou,  ) and include lack of control of statistical methodologies adopted by original articles and consideration only of peak coordinates. A shortcoming of the current study is data we report here are in majority based on female participants as original articles favored recruiting female participants who may show a greater response to faces. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed to assess the concordance of brain activations derived from experiments that identified more activity in dynamic compared to static faces and other control tasks. We observed concordance across studies in brain areas well established in the face processing literature, as well as the cerebellum, which is not discussed in models associated with face processing. The observed results suggest that dynamic faces require increased resources in the brain to process complex, dynamically changing features of faces. The current data provide a stereotaxic set of brain regions that underlie dynamic facial expression in typical adults. Practically, these normative data can serve as a benchmark for future studies with atypical populations, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Theoretically, these findings provide further support for an extended set of areas that support processing of dynamic facial expression. Overall, our present findings can inform current models and help guide future studies on dynamic facial expressions. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nOZ helped collect and analyze data and prepared the first draft of the manuscript.

The default mode network (DMN) as a mental process might influence brand equity related consumers' decision-making, as reported in the marketing literature. While studies on the overlapping regions between the DMN and value-based decision-making related brain regions have been reported in neuroscience literature, relationships between the DMN and a neural mechanism of brand equity have not been clarified. The aim of our study is to identify neural substrates of brand equity and examine brand equity-related mental processes by comparing them to the DMN. To determine the neural substrates of brand equity, we first carried out the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. We examined 26 studies using branded objects as experimental stimuli for the ALE. Next, we set the output regions from ALE as the region of interest for meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM). Further, we compared the brand equity-related brain network (BE-RBN) revealed by the MACM with the DMN. We confirmed that the BE-RBN brain regions overlap with the medial temporal lobule (MTL) sub-system, a module composed of the DMN but excluding the retrosplenial cortex. Further, we discovered that several brain regions apart from the DMN are also distinctive BE-RBN brain regions (i.e., the insula, the inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, ventral striatum, parietal region). We decoded the BE-RBN brain regions using the BrandMap module. The decoded results revealed that the brand equity-related mental processes are complex constructs integrated via multiple mental processes such as self-referential, reward, emotional, memory, and sensorimotor processing. Our study demonstrated that the DMN alone is insufficient to engage in brand equity-related mental processes. Therefore, marketers are required to make strategic plans to integrate the five consumer's multiple mental processes while building brand equity. \n  \nConsumer neuroscience, Neuromarketing, DMN, Consumer decision making, ALE, Brand management, fMRI. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBranded products and services have several advantages over unbranded ones. Consumers are willing to buy branded products at higher prices ( ). They often buy branded products without deliberative thoughts ( ) and have unconsciously favorable perceptions of them ( ). These behaviors tend to be habituated as long as they are satisfied with the products ( ). Thus, most firms manage to add value to general products and services through branding, as this is an important source of financial profit for them ( ). \n\nWhat are the differences between branded and unbranded products? In marketing, these differences are attributed to \u201cbrand equity.\u201d Brand equity can be understood as the strength of influence of a brand name as perceived by customers and the unique value premium that a company makes. Brands enjoying strong brand equity have a competitive edge when compared to their competitors and are therefore placed in an advantageous market position. Brand equity likely leads to higher consumer preferences, purchase intentions, and choice probabilities ( ). Interbrand, which is a representative brand consulting firm, evaluated brand equity among dozens of brands and reported that Apple was considered the world's most valuable brand in 2020 ( ). Apple produces a wide range of product categories and has dominant positions in these markets. Apple's success reveals that brand equity has been a crucial concept in marketing strategies for many decades. \n\nThe method of building brand equity has been theoretically and practically researched for three decades.   organized the brand equity elements into five factors: brand associations, brand name awareness, brand loyalty, perceived brand quality, and other proprietary brand assets such as patents, trademarks, and channel relationships.   defined brand equity as the \u201cdifferential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing of the brand.\u201d   referred to brand equity as \u201ca set of mental associations and relationships built up over time among customers or distributors.\u201d Thus, brand equity is an intangible asset residing in consumer's minds unlike tangibles, such as factories and office buildings. \n\nOver the past two decades, neuroscience approaches have been employed in marketing. Many consumer-neuroscience studies have provided important findings about brain regions related to consumers\u2019 decision making toward branded objects. However, these brain regions seem to be distributed in a wide variety of areas and are poorly convergent.   reported that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus are the brain regions related to strong brand equity when comparing brands with strong and weak equity. In studies on brand personality, which is a critical concept in brand associations,   reported that the MPFC is indeed associated with brand personality. These studies indicated that memory processing plays a crucial role in brand equity-based decision making.   demonstrated that it was not the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) but the inferior frontal gyrus that is related to brand personality judgment and argued that the information processed between a person and brand personality is distinct. They focused on the influences of self-referential processing on brands with brand equity. Meanwhile, according to  , the activation of the ventral striatum (VS) was observed when investigating the brain regions related to favorable brands.   showed that the globus pallidus is related to the preference for a brand with strong equity. They emphasized the involvement of reward processing in brand equity-related mental processes.   showed the amygdala was associated with separation distress in regard to beloved brands. The amygdala is involved in emotional processing ( ;  ). This is the study focused on the emotional processing aspect of brand equity-related mental processes. Thus, although the mental processes corresponding to specified brain regions were examined in previous consumer neuroscience studies, few studies have assessed brand equity-related mental processes from the perspective of functional connectivity in the brain. \n\nMoreover, brand equity-related mental processes, which may derive from the default mode network (DMN), are reported in the marketing literature. Numerous studies reported that the DMN is engaged in inward mental processes, such as recalling the past, wandering mental states, imagining the future, remembering autobiographical memory, self-related functions, scene construction, spontaneous thought, automated responses, decision-making based on system 1, and social cognition ( ;  ;  ). For example, self-related functions are also one of the most important attributes of brand equity related mental processes. A self-expressive benefit is the most crucial value proposition derived from brand equity and is the most representative self-related concept on brand equity ( ). Spontaneous brand recall is an important metric for marketing strategies because it contributes significantly to financial performance ( ). Spontaneous brand recall might be associated with spontaneous thought, a mental process derived from the DMN.   noted the social cognitive aspects of brand equity. Consumers\u2019 decision-making processes including the brand equity-based decision making are one of the behaviors derived from subjective value-based decision making. Several brain regions related to subjective value-based decision making, such as the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), MPFC, VS, medial temporal lobe (MTL), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), have been revealed by neuro imaging meta-analysis studies ( ;  ;  ).   noted resemblances between the DMN and value-based decision making with regard to these activated brain regions.   demonstrated that most of the brain regions related to subjective value-based decision making overlapped with most of the brain regions comprising the DMN. Despite these resemblances between mental processes derived from two distinct sources, such as the DMN and brand equity, no studies have been conducted to assess the overlap of the DMN and brand equity-related regions of the brain. \n\nTherefore, the aim of the present study is to reveal the distinct brain regions related to brand equity and to provide characteristics for brand equity-related mental processes in consumers\u2019 decision making by comparing brain regions involved in both the brain equity-related network (BE-RBN) and the DMN through performing a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \nFirst, to compare the brand equity-related brain regions with the DMN-related brain regions, we collected related foci data. Each activation likelihood estimation (ALE) map was created using an ALE method based on each focus. Second, meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) was conducted by setting each cluster of the brand equity-related brain regions, which were produced by an ALE method, as a region of interest (ROI).   pointed out that brain regions identified by MACM are almost equal to brain regions consisting of resting state networks. This means that brain regions identified by the MACM might represent brain regions comprising the BE-RBN. Last, we conducted a conjunction and contrast analysis between the BE-RBN and DMN to reveal overlap and each distinct brain region in both brain networks. We attempted to identify each characteristic mental process derived from these distinct brain regions in both brain networks. Moreover, we assessed publication biases on the ALE results about the brand equity-related brain regions using Fail-Safe N (FSN) analysis. \n\n### Data collection and an ALE method \n  \nFirst, a systematic literature search was performed to select neuro imaging studies on consumers' decision making on branded products and services. The search was conducted using the PubMed database ( ). We included published studies between January 2000 and March 2021 from only peer-reviewed English language journals. We searched for studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the specific terms \u201cbrand,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201cneural,\u201d \u201cchoice,\u201d \u201cpurchase,\u201d \u201cdecision-making,\u201d and \u201cpreference.\u201d This search processes yielded 10 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and choice\u201d; 0 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and purchase\u201d; 11 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and decision-making\u201d; 12 for \u201cbrand, fMRI, neural, and preference\u201d; 38 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and choice\u201d; 12 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and purchase\u201d; 48 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and decision-making\u201d; and 26 for \u201cconsumer, fMRI, neural, and preference.\u201d We then added the studies listed in Plassmann's ( ) literature lists on branding. Studies were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) studies that conducted fMRI scans of healthy participants, (2) studies that were conducted in a consumption context, (3) studies where branded objects were used as experimental stimuli, for example, products, logo, advertising with brand logos, and (4) those that reported activations as three-dimensional coordinates in the stereotactic space of Talairach or the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Moreover, in this study, we included studies for this meta-analysis, regardless of types of stimulus materials for experiments, such as foods, consumer package goods, and durable goods. We excluded studies that did not meet these criteria. However, there were a few exceptions to the inclusion and exclusion. Two studies ( ;  ) did not directly use branded objects as experimental stimuli. However, they were ultimately included in quantitative synthesis because these stimuli were regarded as objects similar to branded ones. These two studies were also included in Plassmann's lists ( ). Additionally, we excluded  , despite using products with logos as experimental stimuli. We considered the attractiveness of their stimuli equal to that of unbranded objects because they controlled for attractiveness between branded and unbranded products. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram ( ) provide details of the screening process. Twenty-six studies were included in the present meta-analysis (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1).   \nPrisma flow diagram. \n  Figure\u00a01   \n\nSecond, for the DMN, foci were collected by searching relevant studies via Sleuth version 3.0.4 ( ). The search criteria were set according to   as follows: (1) Context in Experiments is \u201cNormal Mapping\u201d; (2) Activation in Experiments is \u201cDeactivation\u201d; and (3) Control in Experiments is \u201cLow level\u201d. The matching results yielded 93 papers that included 185 experiments, 1,631 foci, and 1,510 subjects. \n\nThe entire activation foci in the Talairach space were converted to the MNI space via a transformation algorithm ( ). Thus, these foci, selected across a wide variety of experiment conditions such as stimuli and task, were used in this study. \n\nThe ALE method ( ) was adopted for the following reasons. First, it is the most popular quantitative meta-analysis method ( ). Second, the BrainMap platform ( ) contains all the necessary tools for an ALE analysis ( ;  ). The GingerALE software calculates an ALE algorism based on the reported foci. Sleuth software is a tool for curating studies to match set conditions, such as experimental tasks, locations, and subjects. Mango software ( ), an associated software of the BrainMap platform, is a visualization tool for the resulting ALE maps and various NIfTI files and implements a decoding analysis tool based on the BrainMap database. In addition to these tools, the BrainMap platform is equipped with a plethora of other functions for neuro imaging meta-analysis. Finally, given that significant brain imaging meta-analysis studies regarding subjective value-based decision-making have been conducted using ALE ( ;  ;  ;  ), adopting an ALE method to assess our results may prove beneficial when comparing findings from these previous studies. It is a coordinate-based quantitative meta-analysis method, and its procedures are as follows. First, the modeled activation map was created by applying three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function to each individual focus. Similar procedures were conducted on all foci of selected studies. With increased convergence of reported foci, across studies, there has been a gradual minimization in the variance of Gaussian probability distribution. This means that the contingency of reported foci in each individual study is expected to be eliminated. Second, an ALE map was obtained by calculating the union of these modeled activation maps. Finally, to create a more accurate ALE map, it was compared with the randomness map created by null distribution. Concretely, the thresholded ALE map was obtained by conducting a permutation test for assessing differentiations between these maps at each voxel ( ;  ). The ALE method was conducted using the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ). The thresholding analyses were performed using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at p = 0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of p = 0.001. The permutation size was set to 1000. In the present study, coordinates were reported in the MNI space. The complete images with brain activations were output as NIfTI files and overlaid onto a canonical anatomical T1 brain template in MNI space using the Mango software (version 4.1;  ). \n\n\n### MACM \n  \nMACM is a method to identify co-activation brain regions related to a set ROI by curating the studies in the BrainMap database ( ;  ). The BrainMap has two kinds of databases: a functional database and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) database. This study used a functional database, which contains 3,406 papers, 111 paradigm classes, 76,016 subjects, and 131,598 experiments. To calculate statistically significant co-activated brain regions with the set ROI, mathematical methods are executed based on curated foci. We adopted an ALE method ( ), and used the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ) to perform the calculation. The thresholding analyses were performed using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at p = 0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of p = 0.001. The permutation size was set to 1,000. \n\n\n### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \nThe conjunction and contrast analysis between the BE-RBN and the DMN were conducted using the GingerALE version 3.02 tool ( ). Different brain regions from these two networks were compared to brain regions generated from a null distribution according to statistically appropriate criteria. Thus, this analysis identified statistically significant overlap and each distinct brain region between the BE-RBN and the DMN. For this analysis, the thresholding criteria were set as follows: P-value = p < 0.05, number of permutations = 1,000, and minimum cluster size = 100 mm . \n\n\n### Decoding analysis \n  \nWe decoded both shared and each distinct brain region, BE-RBN and DMN, using the behavioral analysis plugin, a brain image analysis application provided by the BrainMap platform ( ). This plugin tool is implemented in Mango software (version 4.1;  ). This plugin tool enables the analysis of behaviors and cognitive functions regarding the set ROI. This tool was developed based on the BrainMap database. Foci corresponding with five behavioral domains (\u201cAction\u201d, \u201cCognition\u201d, \u201cEmotion\u201d, \u201cInteroception\u201d, and \u201cPerception\u201d) are organized in the BrainMap database. Moreover, these behavioral domains are classified into sixty sub-domains. For example, the Action domain has eight sub-domains such as \u201cExecution (Speech)\u201d, \u201cExecution (Unspecified)\u201d, \u201cImagination\u201d, \u201cInhibition\u201d, \u201cMotor Learning\u201d, \u201cObservation\u201d, \u201cPreparation\u201d, and \u201cRest\u201d. Thus, the sub-domain items are detailed profiles of behavioral domains. The detailed items of the sub-domains are listed on the BrainMap home page ( ). Given that each activated focus has a unique sub-domain tag, characteristic items of sub-domains corresponding with the set specific ROI can be calculated by significance testing. This is a method of comparing observed probabilities of sub-domain items within the set specific ROI with probabilities generated from the null distribution. Therefore, statistically significant behavioral and cognitive profiles within the ROI can be calculated. An item is considered significant if its z-score is above 3.0. This criterion was determined based on a bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p \u2264 0.05). Thus, because the correspondences between sub-domains and brain regions were statistically validated, the usage of the plugin can be expected to avoid a reverse inference problem ( ). Given that the plugin is provided using the Talairach template, the ROI created on the MNI template is needed to transform the MNI space to Talairach space. \n\n\n### Fail-Safe N for the results of ALE on brand equity related brain regions \n  \nAlthough the coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) such as ALE have rigorous methods, publication biases are important concerns. To assess this problem, we validated the publication biases of our ALE results for brand equity related brain regions by conducting FSN analysis. FSN refers to the maximum number of studies that alter results obtained by a meta-analysis. Thus, the larger the number of FSN, the more robust the results obtained by meta-analysis. According to  , there is an estimation for normal mapping in that a confidence interval with 95% for the number of studies that report no local maxima varies from 5 to 30 per 100 published studies. Thus, given that 94 experiments are contained in our study, unpublished experiments were estimated at 28 and the minimum FSN was also set as 28. We calculated the FSN in each cluster in our ALE results based on the procedure described by  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### ALE \n  \nIn terms of activation foci related to brand equity, the meta-analysis identified significant convergence in five clusters ( ;  -(a)(b) (c)). These clusters were located in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC, BA32, ventral MPFC [VMPFC]), the medial frontal gyrus (MFG, BA10), the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG, the entorhinal cortex <BA28>, hippocampus), the caudate head (the anterior part of ventral striatum), the posterior cingulate cortex <PCC> (the retrosplenial cortex <RSC>; BA29, BA30), and the lingual gyrus.

The search criteria were as follows: (1) Context in Experiments is \u201cNormal Mapping\u201d; (2) Activation in Experiments is \u201cDeactivation\u201d; (3) Control in Experiments is \u201cLow level\u201d; and (4) MNI image in Location is \u201ceach ROI corresponding to each cluster\u201d that we created. The matching results in cluster1 yielded 19 papers that included 23 experiments, 448 foci, and 365 subjects. The matching results in cluster2 yielded 18 papers that included 22 experiments, 353 foci, and 323 subjects. The matching results in cluster3 yielded 14 papers that included 14 experiments, 325 foci, and 254 subjects. The matching results in cluster4 yielded 2 papers that included 2 experiments, 25 foci, and 59 subjects. The matching results in cluster5 yielded 8 papers that included 8 experiments, 195 foci, and 116 subjects. The MACM input data were constructed by aggregating these foci. After two duplicated foci were eliminated, 1,297 foci were adopted as the MACM input data. The MACM results are shown in   and  (b).   \nRegional foci of brain activation by the MACM (Brand equity-related brain network). \n  Table\u00a03     \n\nSignificant activated brain regions were divided into 13 clusters. Brain regions with the highest ALE value within each cluster are as follows: caudate (caudate body, Cluster1), claustrum (Cluster2), superior frontal gyrus (SFG, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex <DMPFC>, BA6, Cluster3), PHG (amygdala, Cluster4), MFG (MPFC, BA9, Cluster5), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA4, Cluster6), superior temporal gyrus (STG, Cluster7), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster7), PHG (amygdala, Cluster8), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster9), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster10), rACC (VMPFC, Cluster11), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster11), and superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster12). Interestingly, even though the posterior regions were set as the ROIs, these regions disappeared. However, when setting loose thresholding criteria (uncorrected p < 0.01), these regions appeared. There is a concern about publication bias in these regions because of the FSN analysis results. Thus, the ALE map created by the MACM can be considered robust because brain regions derived from clusters with publication biases were eliminated. The result is partially consistent with results of previous subjective value-based decision-making studies even though the activations of the PCC were observed in a few of them ( ;  ;  ;  ). This means that connections between the posterior region and other brain regions might be weak in the BE-RBN in comparison with a few subjective value-based decision making. The activations of the PCC seem to depend on types of reward modalities and decision-making modes ( ;  ;  ;  ). Therefore, along with an activated position of the VMPFC, investigating the activation of the PCC is a useful cue for assessing reward modalities of brand equity. \n\n\n### Conjunction and contrast analysis \n  \n#### Conjunction analysis \n  \nThe ALE map produced by conjunction analysis revealed five clusters in overlapping brain regions across both the BE-RBN and DMN ( ;  (a)): the rACC (cluster 1), MPFC (cluster 2), PHG (cluster 3, 4), and caudate (caudate head, VS; cluster 5). In particular, brain regions within the PHG were activated across cluster3 and cluster4. These regions were composed of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (BA28, BA34). Therefore, the anterior part of the medial prefrontal region, the medial temporal region, and the ventral striatum were revealed as significantly characteristic brain regions shared between the BE-RBN and DMN. This result is almost the same as that found by  , excluding the PCC.   \nThe results of conjunction analysis (BE-RBN & DMN). \n  Table\u00a04       \nResults of conjunction and contrast analysis.

The brain regions revealed in each cluster are as follows: claustrum (Cluster1), insula (Cluster2), SFG (DMPFC, BA6, Cluster3), lentiform nucleus (medial globus pallidus <MGP>, Cluster4), MFG (MFPC, BA9, Cluster5), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA4, Cluster6), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster7), precentral gyrus (PreCG, BA6, Cluster8), lentiform nucleus (lateral globus pallidus <LGP>, Cluster9), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster10), superior temporal gyrus (STG, BA22, Cluster11), postcentral gyrus (PoCG, BA40, Cluster12), and rACC (BA32, VMPFC, Cluster13). Cluster1 broadly covers brain regions including the insula, striatum, and lateral cortical regions such as the STG, inferior frontal gyrus, and PreCG. Both cluster4 and cluster8 cover the VS, the bilateral PHG, including the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (BA28, BA34). Although the MPFC corresponds to cluster3, cluster5, and cluster13, the positions of these clusters are different. Cluster3 is placed at the dorsal MPFC, while both cluster5 and cluster13 are placed at the ventral MPFC. Clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 broadly cover the lateral parts of the cortical regions, excluding the posterior parts. Interestingly, the insula is included in clusters 1, 2, 9, and 10. The anterior insula corresponds to clusters 1 and 2, while the posterior insula corresponds to clusters 9 and 10. Moreover, although the PHG and the VS were observed in overlapping regions between the BE-RBN and DMN, these regions were also detected in this contrast analysis. This means that these regions might have more intensive and varied commitments to functions of the BE-RBN than the DMN. Although   demonstrated that the MPFC was characteristically activated in the more anterior part of the subjective value network than in the DMN, this study showed that the activated MPFC was observed in the posterior parts in comparison with the regions observed in the DMN.   \nThe result of the contrast analysis (BE-RBN > DMN). \n  Table\u00a05     \n\nFor the DMN, distinct brain regions were divided into eight clusters ( ;  (c)). The brain regions revealed in each cluster are as follows: middle cingulate cortex (MCC, BA31, cluster 1), middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, cluster 2), SFG (BA8, cluster 3), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, cluster 4), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA10, cluster 5), subcallosal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA25, cluster 6), medial frontal gyrus (MFG, MPFC, BA11, cluster 7), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA39, cluster 8). Cluster1 comprised brain regions covering the medial to lateral areas of the posterior cortical region. Most of the brain regions of the PCC were included in cluster1. The MPFC corresponded to clusters 4, 5, 6, and 7. In clusters 4 and 5, the anterior parts of the MPFC were activated. In clusters 5 and 6, subgenual parts of the MPFC were activated. Thus, for the DMN, characteristically activated brain regions were broadly distributed in the MPFC and PCC. These regions have been known as the core modules composing the DMN core network ( ). The MPFC is the module of the anterior DMN, while the PCC is the module of the posterior DMN.   \nThe result of the contrast analysis (BE-RBN < DMN). \n  Table\u00a06     \n\n\n\n### Decoding analysis \n  \nTo decode the revealed distinctive and shared brain regions between the BE-RBN and the DMN using the behavioral analysis plugin tool, we created the ROIs based on the Talairach coordinate template using Mango software. The Talairach template was created by modifying the MNI template with the transform function in Mango software. All ROIs were created according to brain region clusters revealed by the conjunction and contrast analysis, and spherical ROIs were constructed. We set each radius of these ROIs to match the actual clusters\u2019 volume size. For example, the volume of cluster 1 in the result of conjunction analysis was 1752 mm , and the radius was set as 7.478mm. The radius was set similarly for other clusters as well. We adopted the center coordinate in each cluster as the focus of each ROI. Center coordinates based on the MNI space were transformed to the Talairach space. The set ROIs are shown in  .   \nSpherical ROIs created based on the results of conjunction and contrast analysis.

Significant domains and sub-domains in behavior and cognitive function were observed in only two clusters (cluster 1 and 3). In cluster 1, \u201cEmotion, Positive (Reward\/Gain)\u201d and \u201cCognition, Reasoning\u201d were significant. In cluster3, \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d and \u201cPerception, Vision (Unspecified)\u201d were significant.   \nThe results of the decoding analysis. \n  Table\u00a07     \n\nIn significantly activated brain regions in the BE-RBN (BE-RBN > DMN), significantly characteristic behavior and cognitive function taxonomy were observed in nine clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). Detailed results are shown in  . Multiple domains (four domains or more were included) were listed in clusters 1, 2, 3, and 8. The \u201cEmotional\u201d domain was dominant in cluster 4, while the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain occupied cluster 6. The \u201cPerception\u201d domain was included in all clusters where significant sub-domains were observed. Regarding the sub-domains, the \u201cPositive (Reward\/Gain)\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cEmotional\u201d domain. On the other hand, the \u201cLanguage\u201d related sub-domain was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain. In particular, \u201cLanguage (Speech)\u201d covered all clusters that included the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain. \u201cLanguage (Semantic)\u201d was included in four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 6). In the \u201cCognitive\u201d domain, other characteristic sub-domains were \u201cAttention\u201d, \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d, and \u201cReasoning\u201d. \u201cAttention\u201d was included in five clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8), and both \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d and \u201cReasoning\u201d were included in four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 8). Interestingly, although the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain has 11 sub-domains, only two sub-domains (\u201cSexuality\u201d and \u201cThermoregulation\u201d) were significant. In particular, \u201cSexuality\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain (clusters 1, 2, 4, and 8). Regarding the sub-domains of \u201cPerception\u201d, any of those related to the five senses (\u201cAudition\u201d, \u201cGustation\u201d, \u201cOlfaction\u201d, \u201cSomesthesis\u201d, and \u201cVision\u201d) were listed in each cluster that included significant sub-domains. Regarding the sub-domains of \u201cAction\u201d, four sub-domains (\u201cExecution [Speech]\u201d, \u201cExecution [Unspecified]\u201d, \u201cImagination\u201d and \u201cInhibition\u201d) were significant. \u201cExecution (Speech)\u201d was listed in all clusters that included the \u201cAction\u201d domain (clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10). \n\nIn significantly activated brain regions in the DMN (BE-RBN < DMN), significant sub-domains were observed only in cluster 1: \u201cCognition, Social cognition\u201d and \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d. \n\n\n### FSN analysis \n  \nThe cluster-wise data on FSN is shown in Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. The number of FSN in clusters 1\u20133 highly exceeded the minimum FSN. Especially regarding clusters 1 and 2, the FSN analysis was stopped at the maximum FSN because the cluster was significant at even the maximum FSN. The FSN analysis in these clusters proved that the ALE results on brand related brain regions were robust against potential publication bias. However, the \u201cfile drawer problem\u201d was confirmed in cluster 4 and 5 because the number of FSN in these clusters were smaller than the minimum FSN. Hence, robustness of the ALE results in these clusters is considered to be low. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBroad, overlapping regions were observed in the MPFC. Especially, as shown in the decoding analysis, the VMPFC plays a crucial role in computing and integrating subjectively experienced reward values derived from different kinds of reward stimuli ( ), including ratings of pleasantness ( ), tracking of the value of financial payoffs ( ), and emotional processes ( ). The amygdala is associated with emotional processing ( ;  ). However, the \u201cEmotional\u201d domain was not significant in the decoding analysis. The VS is associated with reward processing. The VS encodes expected reward values and negative values, such as punishments ( ). Its anterior parts are associated with positive rewards such as euphoria ( ). The VS also plays a key role in reward-related approaches and avoidance behaviors ( ).   reported that the VS is the core region that represents the values of utilitarian and hedonistic goods. A large number of studies has shown correlations between the VS and rewards. Activities in this area are associated with the magnitude of cumulative rewards ( ), anticipation of reward ( ), and social rewards such as evaluation of faces ( ), reputation, and social hierarchy ( ). Thus, the VS is thought to compute reward values, which are prediction errors between expected rewards and outcomes ( ). Moreover, the VMPFC and the VS were crucial modules of the neural common currency (NCC) network ( ;  ). These brain areas are dopaminergic midbrain regions and are known as the core regions of the NCC hypothesis. In the NCC hypothesis, subjective values are thought to be encoded in the same brain regions by a single scale, regardless of reward type. Many empirical studies have proven this hypothesis ( ). Activities in these areas are associated with various types of subjective reward magnitude ( ), the subjective valuations of gains and losses in behavioral loss aversion ( ), discount function, subjective values of delayed monetary rewards ( ), and outcome values of rewards ( ). Given that the decoded results showed that \u201cPositive (Reward\/Gain)\u201d was significant in these regions, it can be considered that these regions are also associated with reward processing. Although, both the VS and amygdala are considered crucial modules of reward networks ( ;  ), \u201cPositive (Reward\/Gain)\u201d was not significant in clusters 4 and 5. The VMPFC and entorhinal cortex are both core components of the medial temporal lobule (MTL) subsystem in the DMN. The MTL subsystem is involved in episodic and autobiographical memory ( ). The decoded result shows that \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d was significant in cluster 3. Thus, the overlapping brain regions can be considered to be functions of self-referential, reward, memory processing. \n\nAlthough the PHG (the amygdala and entorhinal cortex <BA28, BA34>) overlapped with the BE-RBN and DMN, broadly strong activations in these regions were also observed in the brain regions of \u201cthe BE-RBN > the DMN\u201d. Interactions between the amygdala and entorhinal cortex in the PHG were engaged in the formation of emotional episodic memory ( ;  ), emotional autobiographical memory ( ) and associative memory related to episodic memories ( ). These considerations are consistent with the decoded results. Regarding these regions that correspond with cluster 4 and 8 (BE-RBN > DMN) in the decoding analysis, both many sub-domains of the \u201cEmotional\u201d and \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d sub-domains were significant in cluster 8. Additionally, in these clusters, \u201cPerception\u201d (sub-domain; \u201cVision\u201d and \u201cOlfaction\u201d) was also significant. The PHG is involved in associative memories related to visuospatial and odor information ( ;  ;  ).   reported that autobiographical memories related to odor information was more vividly recalled than other sensory information ( ). \n\nIn contrast, the contrast analysis (BE-RBN > DMN) result showed that the insula covered four clusters (clusters 1, 2, 9, and 10). This indicates that the insula can be considered a distinct brand equity-related brain region. The insula is engaged in various emotional and cognitive mental processes derived from self-generated interoceptive feelings ( ;  ;  ). Since the anterior insula is the center of the salience network, it has connections with the amygdala and VS ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe interconnections among these brain regions are associated with behaviors driven by impulsive feelings, such as addiction, sexual emotion, and drug abuse ( ;  ). Actually, the \u201cSexuality\u201d sub-domain in the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain was significant in clusters that demonstrated these connections (i.e., clusters 1, 2, 4 and 8 [BE-RBN > DMN]). As shown in the decoded result that \u201cPositive (Reward\/Gain)\u201d was significant in clusters 1 and 2, activations in the anterior insula were observed in the reward and value-based decision-making contexts ( ;  ;  ;  ).   reported that the anterior insula is engaged in risk learning in risky decision making ( ). In addition, the posterior insula has connections with the sensorimotor cortex and the parietal cortex (i.e., the precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus;  ,  ;  ). These regions play a crucial role in sensorimotor processing ( ). Similar to the anterior insula, the posterior insula is also involved in visceral processing such as sexual emotion ( ). These considerations were partly proven in the decoding analysis. The \u201cperception\u201d domain was significant in clusters that demonstrated an interconnection among the posterior insula, sensorimotor cortex, and parietal cortex (i.e., clusters 6, 7, 9, and 10). However, the \u201cSexuality\u201d sub-domain in the \u201cInteroception\u201d domain was not significant in these clusters. Additionally, the results for clusters 1, 2, and 3 showed that semantic memory-related sub-domains such as \u201cLanguage (Semantic)\u201d and \u201cCognition, Memory (Explicit)\u201d were significant. The IFG (clusters 1,2) and SFG (DMPFC, cluster 3) included in these clusters are both associated with semantic memory ( ), implying its influence on brand equity-related mental processes. Connections of the DMPFC, IFG, and PHG are involved in semantic associative memory ( ). This interpretation is consistent with the findings of previous consumer neuroscience studies ( ;  ;  ). Interconnections within the DMPFC, the IFG and the PHG are associated with familiarity, along with various sensory modalities such as visual and music ( ;  ,  ). Taking into consideration the discussion on episodic and autobiographical memory as described above, memory processing plays a crucial role in brand equity-related mental processes. In particular, the comprehensive associative memory system, which includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memories, may be intensively involved in brand association facet, which is a component of brand equity. Brand associations is a construct of combining brand name with brand knowledge, including multiple modalities derived from marketing communications and other experiences between brands and consumers ( ;  ). Constructing a comprehensive associative memory system might generate a sense of familiarity toward brands. Therefore, brand association can be considered as a construct centrally functioned by the PHG. Moreover, given that activations of the PHG, which is located primarily in the entorhinal cortex <BA28, BA34>, were not reported in previous subjective value-based decision-making studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), the associative memory system driven by the PHG can be presumed to be a distinct, characteristic mental process among various value-based decision-making processes. When combined, brain regions in \u201cBE-RBN > DMN\u201d are considered to play a role in self-referential, reward, emotional, memory and sensorimotor processing. \n\nIn contrast, the contrast analysis (BE-RBN < DMN) revealed that the anterior areas of both the MPFC (aMPFC) and PCC are the main distinctive brain regions in the DMN. The aMPFC and PCC are both crucial core nodes in the various types of DMN subsystem studies ( ;  ). The aMPFC is the core node of the anterior DMN ( ). The PCC is the core node of the posterior DMN ( ). The aMPFC is involved in the shifting of attention to future directions, the imaging of future results ( ), and imaging future outcomes ( ). The increased activations in the PCC were observed when simulating the future and when reflecting on the future self ( ;  ). This region is also involved in social cognitions such as simulating others' mental state and theory of mind ( ;  ). In addition, the retrosplenial regions of the PCC have connections with the MTL, the region associated with episodic and autobiographical memory ( ;  ). Although these mental processes were not significant regarding the aMPFC, both the \u201cSocial cognition\u201d and \u201cMemory (Explicit)\u201d sub-domains were significant in the PCC. Compared with the BE-RBN, given that the PCC might be the strongly distinctive brain region, social cognition-related mental processes can be considered as characteristic in the DMN. While activations of the PCC were observed in other value-based decision-making studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), no activations were observed in the BE-RBN.   Thus, the brand equity related mental processes are presumed to be a construct with weak social cognitive aspects, although the \u201cSocial Cognition\u201d sub-domain was significant in cluster 3 of the contrast analysis (BERBN > DMN).   From the view of reward modalities, although activations of the PCC were observed in monetary rewards, little activations of the PCC were shown in primary (food, erotic) and aesthetic rewards ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, a few studies pointed out that abstract rewards, such as money, are encoded in the more anterior parts of the VMPFC ( ;  ). Conversely, primary rewards, which include foods and erotic stimuli, are encoded in the more posterior parts of the VMPFC ( ;  ). According to  , activations of the posterior part of the VMPFC were observed in aesthetic processing ( ). The VMPFC's activated areas in the BE-RBN were located in its posterior parts. As a result of activated position of the VMPFC and deactivations of the PCC, a brand with brand equity can be considered a less abstract reward akin to primary and aesthetic rewards. \n\nTherefore, while we revealed that the BE-RBN overlaps with the MPFC and the MTL sub-system, excluding the PCC retrosplenial regions, we also identified several distinctive brain regions of the BE-RBN apart from the DMN, such as the IFG, insula, VS and parietal regions. This result indicates that the function of the DMN alone might be insufficient to engage in brand equity-related mental processes. Moreover, the decoded results demonstrate that these brain regions are associated with self-referential processing, reward processing, emotional processing, memory processing and sensorimotor processing. Thus, brand equity-related mental processes can be considered as complex constructs composed of these multiple mental processes. Thus, although each mental process has been observed in previous consumer neuroscience studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), brand equity-related mental processes can be considered complex constructs in which these multiple mental processes are integrated. In other words, they can be interpreted as subjective and rewards processing, involving an impulsive emotional associative memory system with multiple sensory modalities inputted. These findings imply that the DMN-like mental processes, such as spontaneous brand recall and self-expressive benefit reported in the marketing literature, can be a construct underlined by not only the DMN, but also other brain networks.   The influence of social cognitive processing on the brand equity-related mental processes is considered to be marginal.   For instance, self-expressive benefit allows brands to realize symbols of a person's self-concept ( ). A consumer wants to be perceived as a creative person by using Apple, or as a sophisticated and elegant person by using Lancome, regardless of the consumer's current status. When an individual watches advertising, sees a logo while walking in the street, or reads news on an SNS, their emotions about a brand would accumulate. Thus, consumers' motivation to purchase brands is to realize their aspirations ( ). This accumulated desire to fulfill self-oriented objectives, along with their aspirations, can be attributed to subjective and reward processing with strong emotional associative memories. \n\nEven though our study has its strengths and we showed that our ALE results, which were used as ROIs for the MACM, were robust by using FSN analysis, it also has a few limitations. First, although we revealed brain regions related to brand equity by aggregating studies using branded objects as stimuli, we did not consider studies using non-branded objects as stimuli. To specify characteristic brain regions in association with brand equity, it would be more desirable for us to compare brand regions related to brand equity with those related to non-branded objects. In our next study, we will perform this comparison. Moreover, we need to assess differentiations between branded objects and non-branded objects in terms of reward modalities. It is especially important to investigate variations on VMPFC positions between them. Regarding this issue, to more precisely identify distinct mental processes of brand equity-related value-based decision making, we need to compare these consumer contextual reward modalities with general reward modalities such as monetary, primary, and aesthetic modalities with rigorous methods. In addition, we noted that memory processing may be a characteristic mental process related to brand equity-related decision-making. However, to precisely identify its characteristic mental processes, BE-RBN needs to be directly compared to the other value-based decision-making brain networks. Second, we conducted an analysis using cross-sectional selected studies that covered various kinds of tasks, stimulus types, and product categories. While this approach has the advantage of being able to take universal outcomes, weak explanatory regions might emerge. For example, there might be differences in brain activated regions in brand equity between brands selling durable versus fast-moving consumer goods. Similarly, even if stimuli might be in the same product category, there may be different brain activated patterns depending on respondents\u2019 profiles, such as age, gender, and personality. Additionally, as a minor point, although spherical ROIs set for decoding analysis were created to match the size of the actual clusters revealed by the ALE analysis, there are some errors in comparison to the size of the actual clusters. For this reason, the decoded results in some clusters might be of low precision. Our study is of great significance for brand equity studies. However, further research is needed. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe revealed that the BE-RBN is a neural mechanism mainly underlined by interactions among the DMPFC, VMPFC, IFG, insula, PHG, VS, and parietal regions. Given that each brain region is a component of a few brain networks (i.e., the DMN, the salience network, the NCC network and sensorimotor network), the BE-RBN can be considered as a neural mechanism interplayed by multiple brain networks. This implies that the DMN limitedly influences the brand equity-related mental processes. From the decoded results, we identified that the mental processes of brand equity are a complex construct that integrates multiple mental processing (i.e., self-referential, reward, emotion, memory, sensorimotor). Our study shows that a brand is not just a reward. For a brand in food category, it could be difficult to build brand equity by only providing good taste. To build brand equity, it might be insufficient to only communicate self-relevant content to consumers through digital media using a machine learning algorithm. Marketers need to conduct initiatives to stimulate consumers' senses and provide experiences to consumers from omnidirectional contact points. These stimuli and experiences must be comfortable, beneficial, and made from the activation of consumers' self-relevant memories. Therefore, marketers need to execute initiatives to integrate consumers' mental processes related while building brand equity. In addition, our results provide guidelines for measuring brand equity. Consequently, marketers need to set multiple variables covering the five mental processes of the consumer (i.e., self-referential, reward, emotion, memory, and sensorimotor) if they would like to comprehensively detect consumers\u2019 perceptions regarding brand equity. Our findings may contribute to more accurate brand equity studies. \n\n\n## Declarations \n  \n### Author contribution statement \n  \nShinya Watanuki: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper. \n\nHiroyuki Akama: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data. \n\n\n### Funding statement \n  \nDr. SHINYA Watanuki was supported by   [JP20K13633]. \n\n\n### Data availability statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n### Declaration of interest's statement \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \n\n\n### Additional information \n  \nNo additional information is available for this paper. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9207674,"text_md5":"ab04e9166180b815372b20259e3ed3b7","field_positions":{"authors":[0,36],"journal":[37,44],"publication_year":[46,50],"title":[61,165],"keywords":[179,271],"abstract":[284,2445],"body":[2454,53534]},"batch":2,"pmid":35734557,"doi":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2022.e09702","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9207674","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9207674"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9207674\">9207674<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9207674  Neural substrates of brand equity: applying a quantitative meta-analytical method for neuroimage studies"}
{"text":"Ubalde, Leonard and Liang, Jing-Nong\nBrain Sci, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nNeurophysiological Assessments of Brain and Spinal Cord Associated with Lower Limb Functions in Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\ncerebral palsy\nwalking\nneuroplasticity\nneurophysiology\nsystematic review\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nBackground: Task-dependent neurophysiological adaptations in people with cerebral palsy have been examined using various techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, peripheral nerve stimulation in order to assess H-reflexes, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. This activity-dependent plasticity is hypothesized to improve specific gross motor function in individuals with cerebral palsy. Although these adaptations have been examined extensively, most studies examined tasks utilizing the upper limbs. The aim of this review is to assess the neurophysiological adaptations of the central nervous system in individuals with cerebral palsy during lower limb functional tasks. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to evaluate the neurophysiological changes in the brain and spinal cord associated with lower extremity tasks in individuals with cerebral palsy. We will search within PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL using a predetermined search string to identify and evaluate relevant studies. Two independent reviewers will screen these studies against our inclusion criteria and risks of bias, and will extract the data from each study. A third reviewer will be used to resolve any disagreement regarding the inclusion of a study between reviewers. Randomized controlled trials as well as cross-sectional studies published in English 10 years before May 2021 that investigate the neurophysiological adaptations in the brain and spinal cord in people with cerebral palsy will be included if they meet the eligibility criteria. Primary outcomes will include scalar values of fractional anisotropy (FA), H-reflex gains or measures of amplitude, as well as motor cortex (M1) cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Discussion: Since no identifiable data will be involved in this study, no ethical approval is required. Our results will provide insight into the neurophysiological adaptations in children with cerebral palsy, which will be useful in guiding directions for clinical decision making and future development of targeted interventions in pediatrics rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. Systematic review registration: The protocol for this systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42020215902). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Background \n  \nCerebral palsy (CP) is the most common disorder affecting posture and motor function in children [ ]. The most common cause is from periventricular leukomalacia causing white-matter damage around the third trimester [ , , ]. Other causes revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include brain malformation, infarcts of the middle cerebral artery, or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [ , ]. These injuries may occur during development, during birth, or within the first few years of life. The most common subtype of CP is unilateral spastic CP [ ], presenting with hyperreflexia, hypertonia, co-contractions, and difficulty performing independent joint movements in one side of the body [ , , ]. Up to 41% of children will demonstrate difficulties with crawling, walking, and running [ ], consequently impacting development negatively. \n\nDamage to cortical and subcortical centers, descending motor pathways such as the corticospinal tract (CST), and spinal reflex pathways is presumed to be the primary cause of these clinical symptoms [ , , ]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method of indirectly measuring brain activity and can be combined with other neuroimaging techniques such as DTI to examine the alteration in cortical activity and reorganization following a brain injury [ , , ]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is a method of reconstructing and examining white matter integrity of the brain structures and corticospinal tracts [ ]. At the cortical level, bilateral hemispheric activity and cortical reorganization of the contralesional hemisphere have been observed when performing tasks with the spastic side, indicating that a significant contribution of motor function in children with unilateral CP comes from non-lesioned cortical centers [ ]. Additionally, decreased CST integrity in the affected lateral half have been observed in children with unilateral spastic CP [ , ].  \n\nSimilar to findings using fMRI, previous studies using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reported changes in upper-limb cortical motor maps in children with CP [ ]. This non-invasive, neurophysiologic technique allows for the observation and investigation of the integrity and signaling strength of these descending pathways [ , , ]. Stimulation at 90% of maximum stimulator output to the lesioned hemisphere elicited no motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in some children with CP; however, when stimulating the unaffected hemisphere, MEPs in bilateral hands were produced, suggesting that the affected lateral half receives ipsilateral projections from the spared motor cortex [ ]. Furthermore, improvements in motor performance after intensive upper extremity tasks have been correlated with increased MEP responses [ ]. \n\nThe spinal cord circuitry is commonly assessed by electrically stimulating the afferent nerve eliciting the H-reflex. Variables commonly reported as functional measures of reflex modulation include peak-to-peak H-reflex amplitudes under comparable background muscle activity, and H-reflex gains defined as the ratio of H-reflex amplitude to average background muscle activity [ , , , ]. At rest, while exaggerated stretch reflexes have been reported in children with CP [ ], peak-to-peak amplitudes of maximal H-reflexes were comparable to age-matched controls [ ]. Furthermore, similar to healthy children, H-reflexes are modulated during gait in children with CP, with increased amplitude during stance and suppression during swing. However, in contrast to healthy children, there is no age-dependent development of H-reflex modulation during gait in children with CP [ ]. Short-term treadmill training in children with CP further increased the H-reflex suppression during the swing phase of gait [ ].  \n\nPreviously, neurophysiological assessments of the brain and spinal cord in children with CP using DTI fractional anisotropy (FA), fMRI, TMS, or H-reflex testing typically examined changes associated with upper extremities tasks [ , , ]. To our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been performed examining the neurophysiological changes that involved lower extremities. A high-quality review examining the neurophysiological changes following lower extremity interventions targeted to improve functional outcomes may instigate the establishment of future clinical practice guidelines for clinicians and practitioners. Thus, we present our protocol to systematically and analytically evaluate the evidence for alterations to neurophysiology measures associated with lower extremity functional tasks in children with CP as assessed using various non-invasive techniques.  \n\n\n## 2. Methods and Analysis \n  \n### 2.1. Review Question \n  \nWhat are the neurophysiological changes in the brain and spinal cord associated with lower extremity tasks in children with CP?  \n\n\n### 2.2. Search Strategy \n  \nThis protocol will follow the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in order to conduct a systematic review of the literature. The following databases will be searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL. The search string and use of Boolean operators will be as followed: \u201ccerebral palsy\u201d AND (TMS OR transcranial magnetic stimulation OR neurophys * OR corticospinal OR h-reflex OR Hoffman * reflex OR fMRI OR functional magnetic resonance imag * OR DTI OR diffusion tensor imag *). Only studies published in English, 10 years from May 2021, will be considered. \n\n\n### 2.3. Type of Participants \n  \nParticipants aged five to seventeen will be the focus of this study. This is to include an age-range of children that typically demonstrate adult-like normative values of lower extremity joint angle orientations and alignment [ , , , , ]. Studies with participants who present with spastic hemiplegic, diplegic, or quadriplegic CP will be included in this review. Furthermore, participants will have no existing orthopedic injuries or other pre-existing neurological conditions. \n\n\n### 2.4. Inclusion Criteria \n    \nFull-text studies published in English 10 years prior to May 2021. \n  \nStudies conducted on individuals aged five and older with spastic CP. \n  \nStudies that investigate the neurophysiological changes in children with CP or age-matched controls with the following assessments: peripheral nerve stimulation to assess the H-reflex pathway, TMS to examine cortical excitability of the corticospinal tract, and fMRI\/DTI recordings of fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract. \n  \n\n### 2.5. Exclusion Criteria \n    \nStudies published in a language other than English. \n  \nStudies that do not include a lower extremity task. \n  \nStudies that do not screen for individuals for use of botulinum toxin, or anti-spastic medication. \n  \nStudies that do not include non-neurologically impaired controls for comparison. \n  \n\n### 2.6. Primary Outcomes \n  \nMeasures of neurophysiologic changes should be reported in eligible studies. These include one of the following measures: FA as measured by DTI, cortical excitability as measured by TMS, and H-reflex gain and\/or amplitudes elicited via nerve stimulation. Furthermore, all outcomes should be associated with a lower extremity-specific task.  \n\n\n### 2.7. Data Management \n  \nArticles and their titles and abstracts will be screened by two researchers to determine whether they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above. Any discrepancy of an article will be resolved with a third reviewer until a consensus is reached. Articles will then be imported to a reference management system (EndNote 20), and any duplicates will be removed. \n\n\n### 2.8. Data Extraction \n  \nThe main data to be analyzed within the abstract are:   \nDescriptive information regarding the study (e.g., study design). \n  \nCategory of CP examined (e.g., spastic vs. dyskinetic vs. hypotonic). \n  \nSimultaneous use of an intervention or task involving unilateral or bilateral lower extremities. \n  \nNeurophysiological assessment to examine the neurophysiological effects of lower extremity interventions. \n  \n\nFull texts of articles will be extracted using the reference management system\u2019s built-in \u201cfind full-text\u201d tool. Further quantitative data regarding the aforementioned primary outcomes will be extracted by each reviewer and will be assessed for homogeneity in order to determine if a meta-analysis on each outcome is possible.  \n\n\n### 2.9. Risk of Bias (Quality) Assessment \n    \nArticles will be independently screened by two reviewers and full readings of articles will be performed along with cross-examination of the respective Study Quality Assessment Tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [ ]. \n  \nArticles will be categorized as good, fair, or poor based on guidelines from the aforementioned assessment tools [ ]. \n  \n\n### 2.10. Strategy for Data Synthesis \n  \nEffect sizes at 95% confidence intervals will be collected to assess the relationships within data, as well as Cohen\u2019s d for estimates of effect size. Quantitative data will be extracted from each article, and a chi-squared analysis will be used to determine homogeneity between observed and expected frequencies. Statistical significance will be set at   p   < 0.05. A narrative synthesis will be written if a meta-analysis is not possible due to the heterogeneity of the studies.  \n\n\n\n## 3. Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review will be the first to present a thorough understanding of cortical and spinal cord function in children with CP. Specifically, we aim to report the neurophysiological adaptations following lower extremity tasks as measured by the H-reflex, TMS, or fMRI fraction anisotropy. As several articles will utilize different functional tasks and neurophysiological tools and measurements, the risk of heterogeneity is high. A narrative synthesis will be formed if heterogeneity proves difficult for the synthesis of a meta-analysis. Final conclusions regarding the implications of neuroplasticity following lower extremity rehabilitation in children with CP will be drawn from this systematic review. Limitations will also be discussed in detail. \n\nAnalyses from the review findings will provide insight into the neurophysiological adaptations in the developing nervous system of children with CP, which can be used to guide clinical decision-making and the future development of targeted neurorehabilitation protocols in pediatric rehabilitation to improve motor function in children with CP. Understanding the effectiveness of different lower extremity tasks to enhance neuroplasticity may supplement strategies for therapeutic rehabilitation in this subpopulation, and may be insightful for other neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders. This study meets the criteria for waiver of ethical approval, defined by the Institutional Review Board of University of Nevada, Las Vegas. We will publish the results of our study in a peer-reviewed scientific journal regardless of the outcome. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8153104,"text_md5":"92fcf98de0b1a0861c5793c795bf3443","field_positions":{"authors":[0,36],"journal":[37,46],"publication_year":[48,52],"title":[63,239],"keywords":[253,326],"abstract":[339,2740],"body":[2749,13794]},"batch":2,"pmid":34068265,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci11050628","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8153104","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8153104"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8153104\">8153104<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8153104  Neurophysiological Assessments of Brain and Spinal Cord Associated with Lower Limb Functions in Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"}
{"text":"Zhong, Siqian and Hu, Yiru and Fu, Yu and Cao, Liping and Zhang, Bin\nBMJ Open, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nFunctional MRI in the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for patients with schizophrenia: a meta-analysis protocol\n\n# Keywords\n\nneuroradiology\nschizophrenia & psychotic disorders\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia is a psychiatric illness associated with brain function alterations and varying degree of treatment resistance, often leading to severe social malfunctioning. In recent decades, numerous studies have been investigating the therapeutic potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a non-invasive therapy for schizophrenia. However, its clinical efficacy remains controversial, as a number of clinical trials indicated moderate therapeutic effect while others failed to reproduce the positive result. Moreover, the neurobiological mechanism of action remains unclear, possibly constricting the application of TMS in clinical practice. The present protocol of meta-analysis aims to investigate the TMS-related functional neuroimaging (ie, functional MRI) features and alterations in subjects with schizophrenia, and to discuss the potential of functional MRI in TMS researches. \n\n\n## Methods and analysis \n  \nThe study selection process will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses guideline and quality assessment will be conducted with a customised checklist. We plan to search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, from their respective dates of inception to 1 May 2020, with language restricted to English and Chinese. Studies focusing on the brain functional alterations in patients with schizophrenia treated by TMS will be retrieved. \n\n\n## Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThis work does not require ethics approval as it will be based on published studies. This systematic review will be publicly disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. \n\n\n## PROSPERO registration number \n  \nCRD42020166288. \n\n \n\n# Body\n    Strengths and limitations of this study     \nThis is a novel meta-analysis focusing particularly on brain functional MRI in the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for schizophrenia. \n  \nThis study will provide informative evaluation of the clinical efficacy of repetitive TMS and shed light on its neural substrate of action. \n  \nThe present protocol mainly focuses on the brain functional changes and the general symptomatic improvement induced by TMS, therefore fails to discuss the effect of different stimulation parameters. \n  \nThe limit of this study is connected with the cross-study heterogeneity that affects the external validity. \n  \nWe use public data that will be freely available after publication. \n   \n## Introduction \n  \nKnown for its prominent psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusion, schizophrenia (SZ), with a lifetime prevalence of 0.30%\u20130.66% in the general population,  is a severe psychiatric illness that tends to be chronic and recurrent, leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment and social disability. \n\nSince a substantial proportion of patients are resistant to first-line antipsychotics, pharmacological interventions are sometimes insufficient in the treatment for SZ.  As a non-invasive neurostimulation technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) seems to be a promising add-on therapy that regulates brain function by activating or suppressing neural activity in an effective and safe manner, even though the evidences are controversial. A number of previous studies have explored the role of TMS in the treatment of cognitive deficit,  auditory hallucinations (AH) and negative symptoms.  For instance, 20 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was considered a safe and well-tolerated treatment for negative symptoms and cognitive deficit of SZ.  However, a randomised, double-blind and sham-controlled trial suggested that therapeutic rTMS administered to the DLPFC in SZ did not result in evident cognitive enhancing effects.  Data from several studies using functional MRI (fMRI) have supported that rTMS on language-perception area can alleviate AH without any impact on functional connectivity (FC) within the language network,  while few other studies have found the FC alteration as the symptom relieved. In an update (2014\u20132018) of the evidence-based guidelines on the therapeutic use of rTMS, experts reviewed its curative effect on AH and negative symptoms; unfortunately, the strong heterogeneity between studies failed to support an extensive clinical application of such treatment. \n\nIn recent studies of meta-analysis, researchers believe that the placebo effect, publication bias and the frequently mentioned cross-trial heterogeneity contributed to the uncertain efficacy of TMS therapy for SZ.  Therefore, in addition to focusing solely on the change of symptomatic features, further explorations on optimisation of stimulation parameters, as well as the neurobiological factors associated with treatment response, are of clinical necessity, so as to provide experiment basis for reliable and effective treatment strategies. \n\nIn fact, neuroimaging technique plays an important role in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of TMS and exploring its neurobiological mechanism of action. A systematic review including 12 studies\u20143 of which involving fMRI\u2014discussed the major contributions of neuroimaging to TMS research in mainly two aspects: (1) for guiding the coil placement, and (2) for understanding the functional activation and connectivity in SZ.  For example, according to some later studies, the treatment targets for AH are mostly identified by performing a language task during fMRI. In a 2012 study, the n-back task was performed twice on a group of patients during the pretreatment and post-treatment fMRI scan, in order to investigate treatment-related brain activation.  Another brain connectivity and AH review indicated that FC alterations of the default-mode network may be related to hallucinations, and therefore rTMS\u2014with its neuromodulatory effects on targeted cortical sites and their associated networks\u2014is a promising treatment option for symptoms associated with altered connectivity in SZ.  In addition, a multimodal fMRI\u2013rTMS study demonstrated changes in cortical plasticity in human during executive cognition. \n\nDespite the extensive fMRI research we mentioned earlier, considerable variability of results exists between these studies, and as far as we are aware of, there has been no meta-analysis to date on studies investigating brain functional alteration induced by therapeutic TMS for SZ. Here we intend to describe the protocol for a meta-analysis aiming to summarise the TMS-related functional neuroimaging features in subjects with SZ, and consequently, to evaluate its clinical efficacy and explore the neural mechanism of action. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis meta-analysis aims to integrate and assess the features of brain function in SZ after receiving TMS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement. \n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \n#### Study types \n  \nCohort studies and randomised controlled trials will be included only if the neuroimaging results are available. Case\u2013control studies, case reports, narrative or systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters and other secondhand studies will be excluded. \n\n\n#### Study design \n  \nBoth resting-state and task neuroimaging studies investigating functional activity or connectivity in patients with SZ treated with active or sham-TMS will be included. Longitudinal studies focusing on the management of SZ will also be considered, but only if the baseline neuroimaging data are available. Studies that (1) did not report whole-brain analyses, or (2) did not report coordinates in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space, or (3) solely focusing on brain structure, will all be excluded. \n\n\n#### Participants \n  \nStudies with subjects with SZ with or without a healthy control group (all without any known severe neurological condition or head trauma) are required. The minimum sample size will be 12 subjects per group, according to previous studies.  Race, age and medication (ie, drug-na\u00efve or medicated) will not be restricted. \n\n\n#### Interventions \n  \nActive TMS or rTMS, and sham-TMS. \n\n\n#### Outcome measures \n  \nSince we focus on therapeutic TMS-induced neuroimaging alteration in SZ, the main outcomes of the included studies are brain regions that indicate significant functional changes, including whole-brain functional activity or FC, and should be presented in MNI or Talairach coordinates. \n\nThe secondary result will be psychotic symptom improvement indexed by the score of Positive and Negative symptom Scale,  the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale or any other clinical assessment scales (eg, the Manchester Scale) reported in the included studies. \n\n\n#### Report characteristics \n  \nOnly published and peer-reviewed original studies in English or Chinese will be included. The date of publication should be prior to 1 May 2020, the anticipated completion date of this review. \n\n\n#### Searching strategy \n  \nThe following sources will be searched: PubMed, OVID, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data, using Medical Subject Headings terms. The searching strategies of PubMed (English) and CNKI (Chinese) are presented in   and will be applied to the other databases. \n  \nSearching strategy \n    \n\n\n### Selection process \n  \nEndNote V.X7 software (Thomson Reuters, New York, New York, USA) will be used to manage literature. After removing duplicates, studies identified by the literature search will be removed independently by SZ and YF, based on title and abstract. Then, the rest of the literature will be assessed by full-text screening for the final inclusion for this review. Any disagreement between the two reviewers will be reconsidered by a third reviewer, BZ. Reasons for study exclusion will be reported. \n\n\n### Data collection \n  \nThe two independent reviewers (SZ and YF) will doubly extract data using a standard data extraction spreadsheet in Excel. Again, any inconsistency between reviewers will be reconsidered and the result determined by the third reviewer (BZ). The following items will be extracted from each record. (1) Publication information: title, first author, publishing time, unit, country or region, and funding support. (2) Details of methodology: participants, sample size, diagnostic criteria, demographic characteristics (including age, gender and so on), imaging modalities, scanner resolution, data analysis strategies, clinical assessments and clinical variables (eg, illness duration and severity, and so on). (3) Results: the significantly altered cerebral regions (defined by MNI\/Talairach coordinates, cluster size and statistical threshold), the results of clinical assessments, and the correlations between imaging data and clinical data. \n\nAny missing information or questions about the above data will be settled by contacting the authors. If no clarification is provided within 4 weeks, the study will be included in the final analysis with its missing information reported. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nSo far, there has been no standard checklist for quality assessment of individual functional neuroimaging studies. We will adopt a checklist (see  ) published in a previous meta-analysis. \n   Quality assessment of individual studies   \n#### Category 1: sample characteristics (10) \n    \nPatients were evaluated with specific standardised diagnostic criteria (1). \n  \nImportant demographic data (age and gender) were reported with mean (or median) and SDs (or range) (2). \n  \nHealthy control subjects were evaluated to exclude psychiatric and medical illnesses and demographic data were reported (1). \n  \nImportant clinical variables (eg, positive and negative symptom, medication status, and illness duration and severity) were reported with mean (or median) and SDs (or range) (4). \n  \nSample size per group >10 (2). \n  \n\n#### Category 2: methodology and reporting (10) \n    \nWhole brain analysis was automated with no a priori regional selection (3). \n  \nMagnet strength at least 1.5T (1). \n  \nAt least 5 min of resting state acquisition (1). \n  \nWhole brain coverage of resting scans (1). \n  \nThe acquisition and preprocessing techniques were clearly described so that they could be reproduced (1). \n  \nCoordinates reported in a standard space (1). \n  \nSignificant results are reported after correction for multiple testing using a standard statistical procedure (AlphaSim, FDR, FWE or permutation-based methods) (1). \n  \nConclusions were consistent with the results obtained and the limitations were discussed (1). \n  \nFDR, false discovery rate; FWE, family-wise error rate. \n\n \nTwo independent reviewers (SZ and YF) will examine for any potential study bias, such as the characteristics of the sample, the methods of randomisation and blinding, the completeness of outcome data and others, using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tool. The assessment will be done at study level. Inconsistencies between SZ and YF will be settled by discussions with the third reviewer (BZ). \n\n\n### Data synthesis \n  \nAll collected data will be put together in a table, including the total and average sample size, age range of subjects, mean duration of illnesses, as well as the clinical assessment results. We will perform a qualitative analysis to examine whether the different functional patterns exist in SZ after the TMS treatment compared with the baseline. Also, we will summarise these results by task-based or resting-state fMRI. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nFirst, the coordinates in MNI and Talairach space extracted from the included studies will be converted to one another for the convenience of our analysis. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis will then be performed to integrate consistent brain regions with significant functional alteration reported in different studies, using GingerALE V.3.0.2 ( ). In the ALE algorithm, the peak coordinates extracted from studies represent their own clusters and were registered as centres in the 3D Gaussian probability distribution. The sizes of these clusters were estimated with experimental design of each study, including sample sizes, between-subject variations, normalising methods and others. Finally, an ALE map was calculated by merging all modelled activation maps obtained through voxel-wise aggregation of all clusters reported in each experiment. This ALE map was then compared against a randomly permuted null-distribution to test for statistical significance. \n\nTo assess the stability of the outcomes, the leave-one-out jackknife sensitivity analysis will be performed using GingerALE. Specifically, this is a procedure that iteratively recalculate the effect size by excluding a different study from the sample at a time and then repeating the analyses. If necessary, subgroup analysis will be performed based on different stimulation parameters of TMS (frequency, intensity and others) and courses of the disease (ie, first-episode or chronic SZ). \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7713205,"text_md5":"bd7e901ace8e1bb3ec63e098cec5bf86","field_positions":{"authors":[0,68],"journal":[69,77],"publication_year":[79,83],"title":[94,225],"keywords":[239,317],"abstract":[330,2058],"body":[2067,15371]},"batch":2,"pmid":33268405,"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2020-038557","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7713205","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7713205"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7713205\">7713205<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7713205  Functional MRI in the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for patients with schizophrenia: a meta-analysis protocol"}

Thus, tau-PET may allow precision-medicine prediction of individual tau-related cognitive trajectories, which can be important for determining patient-specific cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe included Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal,   n   = 121) or Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively normal to dementia,   n   = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for independent validation (controls\/Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum=46\/65). All participants underwent baseline  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial   R  ) between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to capture patient-specific cognitive decline. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99\u00b17.69] and A05 [age = 74.03\u00b19.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCombining tau-PET with task-fMRI-derived maps of major cognitive domains facilitates the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. This approach may help to increase the sensitivity to detect Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related cognitive decline and to determine personalized cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186\/s13195-022-01105-5. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau pathology ensuing neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [ ,  ]. While neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers of A\u03b2 and tau are routinely established for AD diagnosis [ ,  ], reliable prognosis of cognitive decline remains a critical challenge, which is further complicated by the considerable heterogeneity in symptom manifestation and disease progression [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAccurate prediction of cognitive decline in AD will be, however, particularly important for clinical trials to (i) stratify patients by progression risk and\/or (ii) determine patient-specific clinical endpoints that allow sensitive assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories within trial-typical 1\u20132-year follow-ups [ ,  ,  ]. Elevated tau-PET is closely associated with the development of cognitive deficits in AD, and recent studies also support tau-PET as a promising prognostic marker for cognitive decline, outperforming the prognostic accuracy of amyloid-PET and MRI-assessed neurodegeneration [ \u2013 ]. Specifically, elevated tau-PET has been associated with faster global cognitive decline and clinical conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Moreover, cross-sectional studies reported that tau-PET patterns closely mirror clinical AD heterogeneity, including occipital tau-PET in posterior cortical atrophy (i.e., visual-variant AD), left-hemispheric tau-PET in language-variant AD, and mesial-temporal-lobe tau in amnestic AD [ ,  ]. This suggests a strong clinico-pathological correspondence between symptom manifestation and tau-PET patterns. Thus, mapping tau-PET to brain networks associated with cognitive domains typically affected in AD may allow the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline, to facilitate the assessment of patient-specific cognitive trajectories in clinical trials targeting tau pathology [ ]. \n\nTo test this, we obtained data from two independent cohorts from the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI,   N   = 261) and the A05 cohort (  N   = 111) covering healthy controls (i.e., cognitively normal A\u03b2\u2212) and AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) with baseline flortaucipir tau-PET and amyloid-PET. Further, all participants were characterized on different cognitive domains including episodic memory (MEM), language (LAN), executive functioning (EF), and visuospatial abilities (VS) across ~1.5\u20132 years of follow-up, which matches follow-up periods of several recent phase 2b&3 clinical trials (e.g., EMERGE\/ENGAGE) [ ]. To assess the association between tau-PET and cognitive-domain-specific decline, we obtained meta-analytical maps of task-fMRI studies from Neurosynth [ ,  ] to determine brain regions that are consistently associated with MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS across ~1900 task-fMRI studies. We then mapped patient-specific tau-PET to cognitive-domain-specific brain activation maps and tested whether determining baseline tau-PET in regions involved in a given cognitive domain improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global\/temporal-lobe tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) that have been suggested as prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Lastly, we used tau-PET predicted domain-specific decline to compute patient-specific weighted cognitive composites, which we hypothesized to capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories more sensitively than commonly used cognitive outcomes. Using simulated interventions, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed cognitive composites (i.e., personalized endpoints) [ ] improve the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional cognitive scores. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### ADNI \n  \nWe included 261 ADNI participants (inclusion criteria:  ) based on the availability of  F-florbetapir\/ F-florbetaben amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (>1 follow-up), demographics (age, sex, education), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. All baseline data were obtained within 6 months; clinical status was classified by ADNI investigators as cognitively normal (CN, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] \u2265 24, Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0, non-depressed), MCI (MMSE \u2265 24, CDR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living), or demented (MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS\/ADRDA criteria for probable AD). Subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI\/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. Ethics approval was obtained by ADNI investigators; all study participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n#### A05 \n  \nA total of 111 participants were selected from the AVID-1451-A05 phase 2\/3 trial (NCT02016560; inclusion criteria:  ), based on the availability of  F-florbetapir amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (\u2265 1follow-up), demographics (age, sex), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. Continuous measures on years of education were not available for all participants and thus not included. All baseline data were obtained within 30 days. Participants were classified as CN (MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment), MCI (24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ], and AD dementia (10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ]. As for ADNI, subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI\/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. The study was approved by the clinical investigator\u2019s local Institutional Review Board; all participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n\n### fMRI meta-analyses of cognitive-domain-specific brain activation and tau-PET assessments \n  \nTo determine tau-PET in regions that are critical for a given cognitive domain (i.e., MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS), we obtained meta-analytical brain activation maps from task-based fMRI studies from Neurosynth ( , see Additional file  : Methods) using the search terms:   episodic memory   (included studies,   N   = 332),   language   (included studies,   N   = 1101),   executive control   (included studies,   N   = 230), and   visuospatial   (included studies,   N   = 267). Methodological details on Neurosynth-based meta-analyses have been described previously (see  ) [ ]. Cognitive-domain-specific meta-analytical task-fMRI maps were binarized and masked with cortical gray matter to exclude typical tau-PET off-target binding regions (i.e., hippocampus\/subcortex) [ ,  ] and applied to spatially normalized SUVR-transformed tau-PET images to extract tau-PET signal within cognitive-domain-specific brain regions (for details on PET acquisition and preprocessing see Additional file  : Methods). To further minimize influences of flortaucipir off-target binding, we used voxel-wise two-component Gaussian-mixture-modeling to transform SUVRs to tau-positivity probabilities (TPP) [ ,  ]. Repeating this procedure for each task-fMRI map yielded cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET signals for MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS (Fig.  A, B (I)). To compare the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting cognitive trajectories against conventional tau-PET measures, we obtained global and temporal-lobe tau-PET SUVRs, which have been previously shown to capture AD-related tau accumulation and predict cognitive decline [ ,  ,  ,  ]. For global tau-PET, we determined average neocortical tau-PET, while excluding typical off-target binding regions (hippocampus, subcortex, cerebellum [ ,  ]; Fig.  B (II)). The temporal-lobe ROI included Braak-stage ROIs 1, 3, and 4 (Fig.  B (II)) [ ,  ].   \nGeneration of meta-analytical task-fMRI maps for assessing cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET (  A  ), surface rendering of regions of interests (ROIs) applied to tau-PET (  B  ), and analysis flowchart (  C  ). First, we compared the predictive accuracy of global tau-PET, temporal tau-PET, and cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline using bootstrapped linear regressions. Note that separate regression models were run for each tau-PET ROI   (CI)  . Second, we ran 1000 bootstrapped linear regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ and extracted beta values for each variable of the regression model (  CII  ), which were later used for assessing patient-specific cognitive composites in both ADNI A\u03b2+ and A05 A\u03b2+ (  CIII  ). Specifically, we applied the 1000 bootstrapped linear model equations to subject level data to determine predicted cognitive change rates for each A\u03b2+ subject of the ADNI and A05 sample. Based on the rank of the predicted cognitive change rates, we then determined a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite. Abbreviations: DV, dependent variable; IV, independent variable; CV, control variable; CR, change rate \n  \n\n\n### Assessment of cognitive changes \n  \nFor both samples, we obtained composites of MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS to assess cognitive-domain-specific changes. In ADNI, we used pre-established composites including ADNI-MEM [ ], ADNI-LAN, ADNI-EF, and ADNI-VS ( ) [ ]. In A05, we generated composites (i.e., A05-MEM, A05-LAN, A05-EF, A05-VS) based on available cognitive tests using a pre-established approach (see Additional file  : Methods, Table S1) [ ,  ]. For each cognitive composite and cohort, annual cognitive changes were determined by fitting linear mixed models with cognitive composites as the dependent variable and time (i.e., years from baseline) as the independent variable, with subject-specific random slope and intercept [ ,  ]. Thereby, we derived subject-specific annual cognitive change rates for each cognitive domain. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll analyses were computed using R statistical software version 4.0.2 ( ). \n\nDifferences in baseline characteristics between diagnostic groups were tested using ANOVAs for continuous and chi-squared tests for categorical data. \n\nTo compare the accuracy of different tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal, Fig.  B) for predicting cognitive decline, we performed bootstrapped linear regression with 1000 iterations per cognitive domain and tau-PET ROI. Within each iteration, cognitive changes on MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS were included as dependent variables, and tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal) as independent variables. For ADNI, all models were controlled for age, sex, education, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. For A05, continuous measures of education were not consistently available; hence, models were corrected for age, sex, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. In each iteration, resulting partial   R   values (variance explained in cognitive change) of the respective tau-PET ROI were extracted. The resulting partial   R   distributions of the different ROIs were then compared using paired t-tests and standardized differences were calculated using Cohen\u2019s   d  . In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CI) of bootstrapped partial   R   distributions were determined for non-parametric comparisons. Main analyses were conducted in AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) and exploratorily repeated in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus AD-spectrum sample (Fig.  C (I)). \n\nNext, we aimed to determine patient-specific cognitive composites that are informed by the baseline tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline, using ADNI as a discovery sample and A05 as a validation sample. Within ADNI A\u03b2+, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regressions controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status to extract 1000 beta-values of the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive changes (i.e., ADNI-MEM\/ADNI-LAN\/ADNI-EF\/ADNI-VS) for each variable of the regression model (Fig.  C (II)). Note, that the cognitive composites which were used for building the model (e.g., ADNI-MEM) included slightly differed tests than the cognitive composites of the validation cohort (e.g., A05-MEM), ensuring additional generalizability of the model and independence from specific tests for MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS. \n\nNext, we entered patient-specific baseline data of both ADNI (i.e., discovery) and A05 (i.e., validation) subjects in the 1000 linear model equations to determine mean patient-specific estimates of cognitive decline. To generate a personalized cognitive composite, we computed squared ranks of predicted cognitive changes across MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS for each subject (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted decline up to 4 =fastest predicted decline), in order to maximize the information weight of cognitive domains with fast predicted cognitive decline. For each subject, cognitive changes (see the \u201cAssessment of cognitive changes\u201d section) were then weighted by the tau-PET informed squared rank (i.e., 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; see Fig.  C (III)) to determine a weighted, personalized cognitive composite that summarizes cognitive changes based on the degree of tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Using a paired   t  -test, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites show stronger cognitive changes compared to conventional cognitive composites that average all cognitive domains. \n\nLastly, we exploratorily tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites are more sensitive for detecting treatment effects compared to conventional measures of global cognition and memory. To that end, we simulated interventions by attenuating cognitive changes by 20\/30\/40% and calculated required sample sizes for detecting simulated intervention effects using the R-package   pwr   (settings: two-sample   t  -test, comparing actual vs. attenuated cognitive changes; two-tailed, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8; see  ). This analysis was performed for tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites, an unweighted cognitive composite (i.e.,   z  -score mean across actual change rates of ADNI\/A05-MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS), as well as actual change rates of MEM (ADNI-MEM\/A05-MEM) [ ]. The latter one was selected, since episodic memory decline is one of the hallmark cognitive symptoms in AD as extensively reported before [ \u2013 ]. The analyses were repeated in the ADNI and A05 AD spectrum groups excluding APOE4 status as a covariate to test whether our models also apply in more simple settings without APOE genotype availability (see Additional file   [ADNI:   n   = 149; A05:   n   = 67]). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample characteristics \n  \nWe included 183\/53\/25 CN\/MCI\/demented ADNI subjects (age = 74.89\u00b17.48 years) and 51\/35\/25 CN\/MCI\/demented A05 individuals (age = 71.29\u00b110.03 years). Descriptive statistics stratified by cohort, clinical status, and amyloid status are shown in Table  . Group-mean tau-PET SUVRs are shown in Additional file  : Fig. S1.   \nSubjects characteristics \n  \nIn ADNI CN: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0, non-depressed; MCI: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living; demented: MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS\/ADRDA criteria for probable AD \n\nIn A05 CN: MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment; MCI: 24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines; demented: 10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines \n\nValues are presented as mean (SD);   p  -values were derived from ANOVAs for continuous measures and from chi-squared tests for categorical measures \n\n MEM  , episodic memory composite score;   LAN  , language composite score;   EF  , executive functioning composite score;   VS  , visuospatial composite score \n\nMean values significantly (  p   < 0.05, post-hoc tests) different from: \n\nCN A\u03b2  \u2212  \n\nCN A\u03b2+ \n\nMCI A\u03b2+ \n\nDementia A\u03b2+ \n  \n\n\n### Cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperforms conventional tau-PET metrics for predicting domain-specific cognitive decline \n  \nFirst, we determined the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future decline in MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS. In ADNI A\u03b2+, bootstrapped linear regression revealed cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as a better predictor of cognitive decline than global\/temporal tau-PET for MEM (cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.175\/0.108\/0.152; Fig.  A), LAN (cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.201\/0.164\/0.136; Fig.  B), EF (cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.132\/0.088\/0.029; Fig.  C), and VS (cognitive-domain-specific\/global\/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.192\/0.097\/0.070; Fig.  D). Further, 95%CIs did not overlap between bootstrapped partial   R  -distributions of the cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and global\/temporal tau-PET ROIs, providing non-parametric support that cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET explains more variance in cognitive decline than conventional tau-PET measures (Fig.  A\u2013D). Congruent results were obtained for the A05 A\u03b2+ validation cohort for all cognitive tests (Fig.  E\u2013H). Detailed results of bootstrapped regressions are provided in Additional file  : Tables S2&3. When repeating these analyses in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus A\u03b2+ sample, we obtained largely congruent results in both cohorts except for LAN in A05 (Additional file  : Table S3). Using SUVRs rather than Gaussian mixture model transformed tau-PET signal of the cognitive-domain-specific ROI yielded consistent results except for ADNI-MEM and ADNI\/A05-LAN (see Additional file  : Table S4&5). The results remained consistent when excluding APOE4 status as covariate from the model (Additional file  : Table S6-10 and Figure S2). Together, these findings suggest that combining tau-PET with meta-analytical task-fMRI maps of major cognitive functions improves the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional global\/temporal-lobe tau-PET measures in AD.   \nBootstrapped linear models (1000 iterations) revealed that partial   R   values (explained variance in annual cognitive changes) were higher for cognitive-domain-specific tau than for global or temporal tau-PET. The boxplots illustrate the partial   R   distributions for episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities within the AD-spectrum (ADNI cohort:   A  \u2013  D  ; A05 cohort:   E  \u2013  H  ). The models were controlled for age, sex [in ADNI: education], clinical status, baseline score of the respective cognitive test, and APOE4 status.   R  -distributions across different regions of interests (global vs. temporal vs. cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET) were compared with paired t-tests. 95% confidence intervals for the mean are displayed as horizontal lines. Within each panel, the tau-PET ROI with the highest explained variance is highlighted by an underscore. *  p   < 0.05, **  p   < 0.01, ***  p   < 0.001 \n  \n\n\n### A tau-PET-informed cognitive composite increases the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline \n  \nNext, we used tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline to determine personalized cognitive composites to better capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories. Specifically, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ (i.e., discovery sample) to determine beta-estimates for the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive decline, controlling for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status. To derive patient-specific estimates for cognitive decline in ADNI A\u03b2+, we then entered individual tau-PET measures and covariates in bootstrapped linear model equations to determine mean estimates for cognitive decline. For each subject, we then square-ranked the resulting cognitive change rates on the four cognitive domains (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted cognitive decline up to 4 =fastest predicted cognitive decline), to determine a rank-weighted cognitive composite that maximizes the information-weight of those cognitive domains in which cognitive decline is expected based on baseline tau-PET. The same linear model equations derived from ADNI A\u03b2+ were then applied to A05 A\u03b2+ for validation. In addition, we determined an \u201cunweighted\u201d cognitive composite as the average   z  -score across all four cognitive domains. We found that the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite showed faster longitudinal decline than the unweighted cognitive composite in ADNI A\u03b2+ (  T   = 20.442,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.728) but not in A05 A\u03b2+ (  T   = \u22121.423,   p   = 0.160, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.176; Fig.  ). When repeating the analysis excluding APOE4 status as covariate, we found a faster longitudinal decline of the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite in ADNI (  T   = 15.624,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.280) and in A05 (  T   = 2.758,   p   = 0.008, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.337; Additional file  : Figure S3).   \nComparison of unweighted (i.e., average of MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites for AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) within the ADNI cohort (  A  ) and the A05 cohort (  B  ). Statistics were derived from paired   t  -tests. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n### Patient-centered cognitive composites can reduce the sample sizes to detect treatment effects in clinical trials \n  \nLastly, we exploratorily assessed whether using tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites as an endpoint in clinical trials increases the sensitivity to detect intervention effects. To this end, we compared estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects (i.e., 20\/30\/40% attenuated cognitive decline) for different cognitive endpoints in A\u03b2+. Specifically, we calculated estimated sample sizes for MEM (ADNI-MEM\/A05-MEM), as well as unweighted (i.e., mean across ADNI\/A05-MEM\/LAN\/VIS\/EF) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites. Across both the ADNI discovery and A05 validation sample, tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites required the lowest number of participants to detect intervention effects for all intervention strengths, although effects were stronger in ADNI (Table  ). Although no significant differences were found between the unweighted and the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite in A05, our finding that the personalized cognitive composite required the lowest sample sizes also in the A05 cohort suggests that personalized cognitive composites assess cognitive change over time more sensitively than cognitive composites that are agnostic for patient-specific tau-dependent cognitive trajectories. When repeating the analysis without APOE4 as covariate, the results remained consistent, showing the lowest required sample sizes when applying the personalized cognitive composite for both cohorts (Additional file  : Table 11).   \nSample size estimation to detect simulated intervention effects of 20%, 30%, and 40% in AD-spectrum patients. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur first finding was that mapping baseline tau-PET to meta-analytical task-fMRI brain activation maps of MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS facilitates personalized prediction of tau-related cognitive trajectories in AD. Specifically, we found tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to predict domain-specific cognitive decline better than conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global\/temporal-lobe tau-PET) which have been previously shown to be prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Second, we showed that using cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as an information source to determine patient-tailored cognitive composites improves the sensitivity to assess AD-related cognitive decline compared to conventional cognitive composites. In exploratory simulated interventions, we showed further that using tau-PET-informed personalized composites as cognitive endpoints may reduce sample sizes required to detect tau-targeting treatment effects compared to conventional endpoints (e.g., MEM, global composites). Together, our independently validated findings suggest that combining tau-PET with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive abilities can facilitate the prediction of AD-related cognitive trajectories, which may improve patient-specific assessments of cognitive changes in clinical trials that target tau pathology. \n\nFirst, we reported that applying task-fMRI maps of MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS to tau-PET in AD patients improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional prognostic tau-PET readouts [ ,  ]. We specifically focused on these cognitive domains since they are typically assessed in cognitive test protocols for evaluating AD in standard clinical settings and clinical trials [ ,  ,  ]. Our findings critically extend previous cross-sectional AD studies, emphasizing a close link between spatially heterogeneous patterns of tau deposition and neurodegeneration with heterogeneous symptom manifestation [ ,  ,  ]. Since tau pathology has been shown to disrupt neuronal connectivity in preclinical [ ] and clinical studies [ \u2013 ], neurotoxic tau may drive network dysfunction [ ] and impairment in the cognitive domain that is supported by the tau-affected network. Supporting this, we found that higher tau-PET in brain regions that support a given cognitive domain [ ,  ] is associated with faster decline in that cognitive domain. While the current study investigated tau-PET as a predictor of cognitive decline for a selected set of cognitive domains typically affected in AD [ ] our proposed methodological framework can be applied for mapping tau-PET to other cognitive or non-cognitive domains, which may motivate future efforts to investigate tau-PET for predicting patient-centered disease trajectories in AD. \n\nSecond, we show that combining baseline tau-PET with task-fMRI maps of MEM\/LAN\/EF\/VS allows determining personalized cognitive composites with increased sensitivity to detect patient-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional patient-agnostic cognitive composites. Specifically, we used baseline tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to forecast domain-specific cognitive decline. To compute a personalized composite, the actual cognitive change rates with faster tau-PET-predicted decline were weighted higher than actual change rates with slower tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Such patient-specific cognitive composites take into account inter-individual variability to facilitate longitudinal assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories [ \u2013 ] and may thus be applied as personalized endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. Supporting this, we exploratorily performed simulated trials in which tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites increased the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional composites, which have been previously used as endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. However, it should be noted that effects on estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects were smaller in A05 than in ADNI, potentially due to differences in cognitive tests used to obtain cognitive composites, differences in baseline scores, differences in the overall clinical characteristics between datasets, differences in frequency of amnestic versus non-amnestic phenotypes, APOE4 frequencies, or different data processing strategies. Despite small effect sizes, results were consistent across both samples; hence, our approach for assessing personalized composites may be a starting point for improving the assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories to reduce sample sizes in clinical trials. Nevertheless, it will be important to replicate our findings across larger studies with harmonized data assessment and clinical characteristics. \n\nA clear strength of the present study is the independent validation across two cohorts with different cognitive assessment protocols. Although sample sizes were smaller in the A05 cohort and effects less strong than in ADNI, the congruent results between both cohorts highlighted the robustness of our findings. Nevertheless, several limitations should be highlighted. First, flortaucipir shows off-target binding within hippocampal and subcortical areas [ ]. Although these regions were a priori excluded, and Gaussian-mixture modeling was performed to further eliminate off-target binding [ ,  ], our results warrant further replication with second-generation tau-PET with an improved off-target binding profile. Second, brain regions like the hippocampus are critical for cognitive function (e.g., memory); hence, second-generation tau-PET which allows hippocampal assessments [ ] may further improve the prediction of cognitive decline beyond what is currently possible with flortaucipir. Third, all analyses were determined across the entire AD spectrum. Here, it will be critical to investigate the predictive accuracy of tau-PET for cognitive decline across different clinical groups once larger datasets become available. This will be particularly important for assessing the potential of tau-PET for predicting cognitive decline in patients with early AD. Fourth, the included samples show differences in the level of clinical impairment, i.e., the A05 shows lower performance on MMSE than the ADNI sample, which may confound the tau-PET-based prediction when applying the ADNI-trained models to A05 data. Here, it will be an important next step to train and validate our models across datasets which are fully comparable across all measures. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate independently validated evidence for tau-PET combined with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive functions as a promising tool for individualized prediction of cognitive decline in AD. Tau-PET-informed cognitive composites may facilitate detecting intervention effects and thus reduce required sample sizes in clinical trials in AD, which also may be retrospectively assessed in clinical trial data with available tau-PET. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9639286,"text_md5":"d0471b7c27b0f3593e4a1eb2c8e3bc6b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,351],"journal":[352,371],"publication_year":[373,377],"title":[388,504],"keywords":[518,588],"abstract":[601,3832],"body":[3841,34381]},"batch":2,"pmid":36345046,"doi":"10.1186\/s13195-022-01105-5","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9639286","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9639286"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9639286\">9639286<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9639286  Combining tau-PET and fMRI meta-analyses for patient-centered prediction of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}

Neurodevelopmental \u2018dual-risk\u2019 theories suggest adolescent vulnerability to problematic substance use is driven by an overactive reward drive mediated by the striatum, and poor cognitive control mediated by the prefrontal cortex. To this end, there has been a growing number of neuroimaging studies examining cognitive and affective neural systems during adolescence for markers of vulnerability to problematic substance use. Here, we perform a coordinate-based meta-analysis on this emerging literature. Twenty-two task-based voxelwise fMRI studies with activation differences associated with substance use vulnerability, representative of approximately 1092 subjects, were identified through a systematic literature search (PubMed, Scopus) and coordinates of activation differences (N = 190) were extracted. Adolescents were defined as \u2018at-risk\u2019 for problematic substance use based on a family history of SUD or through prospective prediction of substance use initiation or escalation. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify the most consistent brain regions associated with adolescent substance use vulnerability. Across the included studies, substance use vulnerability was most reliably associated with activation differences in the striatum, where at-risk adolescents had hyper-activation in the dorsal subdivision (putamen). Follow-up analyses suggested striatal differences were driven by tasks sharing a motivational and\/or reward component (e.g., monetary incentive) and common across subgroups of substance use risk (family history and prospective prediction studies). Analyses examining the role of psychiatric comorbidity revealed striatal activation differences were significantly more common in samples whose definition of substance use risk included cooccurring externalizing psychopathology. Furthermore, substance use risk meta-analytic results were no longer significant when excluding these studies, although this may reflect limitations in statistical power. No significant activation differences were observed in prefrontal cortex in any analysis. These results suggest striatal dysfunction, rather than prefrontal, may be a more primary neural feature of adolescent vulnerability to problematic substance use, possibly through a dimension of individual variability shared with externalizing psychopathology. However, our systematic literature search confirms this is still an emerging field. More studies, increased data sharing, and further quantitative integration are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the neuroimaging markers of adolescent substance use risk. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSubstance use typically begins in adolescence ( ), a developmental period characterized by increased sensation-seeking and risk-taking behaviors and the continued refinement of cognitive and affective brain systems ( ). Early and problematic substance use increases the risk for impulsive behaviors ( ) and subsequent substance use disorders (SUDs)( ). While an extensive literature has outlined sociodemographic, psychological, and behavioral risk factors for problematic substance use, considerably less is known about reliable neurobiological risk factors. This disparity undermines the construction of models that integrate across psychosocial and neuroscientific domains, which are likely essential for comprehensive substance use prevention ( ). \n\nNeurodevelopmental models suggest a predominance of striatal-reward function over cortically-mediated cognitive control may distinguish adolescence as a sensitive period in the development of problematic substance use ( )( )( ). Therefore, adolescents at increased risk for problematic substance use, either through a family history of SUD, or early and escalating experimental use, may display an exaggeration of this normative reward-cognitive control imbalance, with hyper-functioning of the striatum and hypo-function of prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical control regions (see ( )( )( )). Importantly, this adolescent vulnerability to future problematic substance use may be neurobiologically distinct from the escalation of problematic substance use to habitual daily use in addiction, where for example, chronic substance use may be maintained by binge, withdrawal, and craving cycles ( ). To date however, due to methodological constraints and variability amongst initial studies (e.g., small sample sizes and differences in sample characteristics, operational definitions of substance use risk, and neuroimaging tasks), fully testing this neurodevelopmental model of substance use vulnerability has been challenging. To this end, initial neuroimaging studies have been inconsistent in the both the spatial location and direction of effect (hyper-versus hypo-activation) of neural correlates of substance use vulnerability in at-risk adolescents (see ( )( )). \n\nA primary challenge posed by the relative inconsistency of the existing literature is that it limits the ability to rule out alternative models of substance use vulnerability. For example, the \u201creward deficiency hypothesis\u201d suggests hypo-function of the striatal reward system predicts substance use escalation ( ) and has received support from studies assessing striatal dopamine function in adults with substance use disorders (cf., ( )). The lack of consistency in the literature also prevents further theory development in determining the relative specificity of neuroimaging markers of risk for substance use disorders from those indexing risk for other forms of psychopathology. For example, \u201cexternalizing\u201d psychiatric disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) have also been associated with increased activation of the striatum (cf., ( )), increased risk for early onset substance use disorders ( ), and have been conceptualized as a part of a transdiagnostic dimension of \u201cdisinhibition\u201d linking substance use and psychopathology ( )( )(see ( ) for review). Alternative transdiagnostic theories have suggested fronto-striatal reward sensitivity may be associated with a vulnerability to approach-related hypomanic symptoms, and there are both reward hypo- and hyper-sensitivity pathways to substance use disorders ( ). \n\nDespite the apparent inconsistency in the existing neuroimaging literature on substance use risk, there is an increasing number of published fMRI studies that can be quantitatively integrated and variability among studies can be explored. For example, comparisons can be made between studies defining substance use risk through prospective prediction of substance initiation and escalation and those studies defining substance use risk through a family history of SUD, which confers genetic and environmental risks for SUD ( ). The relative impact of defining substance use risk with and without cooccurring externalizing disorders, a common practice in the literature, can also be evaluated. \n\nHere, we use Multi-level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA), a coordinate-based meta-analysis approach that determines spatial consistency across whole-brain (voxelwise) statistical results, to quantitatively integrate 22 studies from this literature and examine which neural systems most reliably differentiate adolescents at increased risk for problematic substance use. \n\nDrawing from the neurodevelopmental literature, we hypothesized that risk groups would display hyper-activation of striatal reward systems and hypo-activation in cortical control regions (prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex). We further hypothesized that if striatal-reward and prefrontal\/posterior parietal-control activation differences are core features of substance use vulnerability, dysfunction in these regions would be consistent across operational definitions of substance use vulnerability and present prior to significant substance use involvement. In addition to these core neurodevelopmental questions, we also sought to disambiguate the role of co-occuring psychopathology on neuroimaging markers of substance use vulnerability. Therefore we examined the potential moderating role of externalizing psychopathology and indentified overlap between our meta-analytic results and a prior meta-analysis of externalizing psychopathology. Taken together, this work aimed to identify central brain systems underlying adolescent substance use vulnerability by integrating existing available data, thereby advancing neurodevelopmental theory and providing critical targets for future research. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nA systematic literature search following PRISMA ( ) guidelines was conducted to identify whole-brain task-based activation studies of substance use vulnerability (records from January 1st, 1990\u2013November 1st, 2018) using Scopus and PubMed databases. Literature searches used substance use vulnerability search stems (\u2018substance use risk\u2019, \u2018alcoholism risk\u2019, \u2018substance use initiation\u2019, \u2018prospective prediction of substance use\u2019, \u2018prediction of substance use\u2019, \u2018substance use vulnerability\u2019, \u2018family history of substance use disorder\u2019, \u2018family history of SUD\u2019, \u2018children of alcoholics\u2019) paired with neuroimaging specifiers (\u2018neuroimaging\u2019, \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018BOLD\u2019, \u2018neural correlates\u2019, \u2018brain systems\u2019)to create 45 total search terms (e.g., \u201cneuroimaging substance use risk\u201d: see  ). Search terms were combined using \u201cOR\u201d Boolean operators. Reference sections from identified studies and relevant reviews ( )( ) were also screened to ensure completeness of the search. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were then screened by authors BTC and AQ to exclude review papers, articles that did not utilize task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, and articles that unambiguously did not meet study inclusion criteria (see below). \n\nFollowing the initial screen, full text versions of remaining articles were reviewed to 1) ensure the study reported task-based activation results, 2) operationalized substance use vulnerability either through a family history of SUD (typically first-degree relatives, see ) or through prospective prediction of substance use initiation or escalation (baseline activation differences predicted future substance use, see  ), in order to isolate risk for SUD without requiring current problematic substance use (see  ), 3) conducted and reported whole-brain\/voxelwise analyses (see  ) comparing family history groups to controls or predicting substance use initiation or escalation, 4) reported coordinates of activation differences of substance use risk groups from whole-brain analysis in a standard anatomical space (i.e., in Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate systems) and 5) included a sample with a   mean   age below 30-years-old. We note that criterion 5 was added after identifying a small number of studies that examined substance use vulnerability in adults and met our other inclusion criteria ( ;  ;  ). There was a clear gap in the mean sample age among these studies (range: 32\u201336) and the remainder of studies meeting our inclusion criteria (range: 10\u201323). We chose the functional cutoff of a   mean   sample age at 30-years-old to ensure that   distributions   of ages in the original studies were inclusive of the adolescent period, typically defined as the second decade of life, and the initiation of problematic substance use (e.g., binge drinking), which peaks in the early twenties ( ) but is thought to reflect normative adolescent processes ( ) that are likely influenced by substance use availability (see ( )). In cases where criteria 3 or 4 were not met, corresponding authors were contacted via email (July 2018) to determine whether coordinates of activation differences or un-thresholded statistical images could be provided. This did not yield any additional studies to be included. Ad-hoc searches were also performed using NeuroVault ( ) with basic keywords (\u2018family history\u2019, \u2018prospective\u2019, \u2018substance use\u2019, \u2018alcohol\u2019) to try and identify relevant un-thresholded statistical images. No relevant maps were identified. Based on the lack of availability of un-thresholded statistical maps, we chose to pursue a coordinate-based meta-analysis using the available published data of peak coordinates. \n\nWithin studies that met inclusion criteria, coordinates of activation difference (foci) associated with substance use risk groups were manually recorded by authors BTC and AQ. In order to ensure accuracy of manual recording, coded foci were then doubly screened by BTC. Subsequently, to further ensure coding of the correct coordinate system (e.g., Talairach\/ MNI) and orientation (e.g., RAI\/LPI), which remain a significant problem in neuroimaging meta-analyses (cf., ( )), spheres convolved from coordinates (see below) were visually inspected and compared to figures from original studies. All foci from activation differences of the group(s) of interest (family history of SUD, prospective prediction) were identified and coded, including those from explicit task contrasts (i.e., go \u2013 no-go), implicit baseline contrasts (i.e., go \u2013 fixation), or parametric modulators. Additional study information coded included the neuroimaging task used, descriptions of voxelwise approach, sample demographic information (sample sizes, number of males\/females, mean age of the sample, IQ), and study inclusion\/exclusion criteria for substance use and psychopathology. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Multi-level Kernel Density Analysis: MKDA. \n  \nMulti-level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) ( ) was used to determine spatial consistency of identified foci associated with substance use vulnerability. We provide a brief overview of MKDA methods, which have been described in detail elsewhere ( ). For each included study, MKDA procedures first convert all foci to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space using the Brett transformation ( ), convolve the transformed foci with a sphere of a user supplied radius (here, 15 mm, based on a recent simulation study ( )) and trim these spheres to only include grey matter voxels in the SPM MNI template. This creates a study-specific contrast indicator map (CIM). Subsequently, a weighted average (weight = square root of sample size) of CIMs is computed, creating an overall density map that represents the weighted proportion of studies that show activation differences in each voxel. Monte Carlo simulations (here, 5000 iterations) are then performed to compare the observed density map to a null distribution of density maps, where each null density map is constructed by randomly distributing the center coordinates of clusters (groups of voxels) in each CIM, which preserves the study-specific spatial structure. Significant clusters are established by comparing the combination of the height of activation (the proportion of studies showing activation differences in a given voxel) and the extent of contiguous voxels with suprathreshold heights in the observed density map to null distributions of these metrics generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. Importantly, unlike other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches, the study-specific CIMs and nested Monte Carlo simulations gives MKDA a multi-level framework, where foci are nested within study. To this end, the unit of analysis in MKDA is the weighted proportion of studies that report activation differences in a given spatial location. This improves generalization of MKDA results to new studies and has the advantage of reducing potential bias from a single study that reports many foci or uses a more liberal statistical threshold ( ). In all analyses, clusters surpassing a family-wise error rate (FWER) threshold of p < .05 with a single voxel alpha of .01 were considered significant. \n\nWe note that following best practices ( ), MKDA is run on studies reporting voxelwise significant differences. Coordinate-based meta-analyses, including MKDA, identify consistency among reported spatial locations (here foci of activation differences of substance use risk) and determine \u201csignificance\u201d through comparisons to a null distribution of random spatial locations across the whole brain, where it is assumed each   voxel   has an equivalent a   priori   probability of being reported (see above). Therefore, including region of interest (ROI) or ROI-constrained small volume correction (SVC) studies would violate MKDA assumptions and bias results towards the regions used in ROI\/SVC studies, potentially leading to circularity concerning brain regions central to study hypotheses. More specifically, ROI studies, which do not use a   voxel   as the unit of analysis, but rather compute mean values across many voxels within specific brain regions, and SVC studies, which utilize a   voxel   as the unit of analysis but limit statistical testing to those voxels within specific brain regions, would bias the type 1 error rate (false positives) in our meta-analysis for regions frequently hypothesized in the literature and bias the type 2 error rate (false negatives) for all brain regions that were not included in the original studies. \n\n\n#### MKDA Testing Procedures. \n  \nConsistent with other recent functional neuroimaging meta-analyses of clinical phenotypes ( )( ), the current project used a tiered procedure for examining consistency in activation differences across the corpus of studies. First, MKDA was performed on all foci from all included studies. This \u2018all studies\u2019 analysis permitted the examination of the most consistent activation differences associated with adolescent substance use risk, irrespective of the operational definition of the substance use risk and the specific neuroimaging task used. Second, subdomain analyses were performed, where consistency in activation differences were examined according to the general type of neuroimaging tasks employed in the original studies. Broad task classifications (i.e., cognitive control, emotional stimuli, reward, substance use stimuli: see  ) were used to provide sufficient power and were defined based on previous work ( )( ). We note however, based on reported activations of tasks included in our meta-analysis and prior research using similar tasks, overlap of task-effect activation patterns is expected within the utilized task classifications (e.g., prefrontal cortex activation across cognitive control tasks: see  ). Owing to the insufficient number of studies using substance use stimuli (n = 4;  ), we did not perform a subdomain analysis on this group. Finally, in order to investigate possible effects of substance use risk definition, we also examined whether meta-analytic effects varied between family history and prospective prediction studies using MKDA\u2019s \u03c7  (chi-square) test ( ). We note that while the above subgroup and subdomain analyses are highly theoretically relevant, these analyses rely on a reduced subset of studies and thus have lower statistical power than the \u2018all studies\u2019 analysis. \n\nIn order to first identify which brain regions were most consistently associated with substance use risk, we performed MKDA on all foci (cf., ( ;  )), irrespective of the direction of group differences ((e.g., \u2018pooled aberrant activation\u2019 ( )), given that the sign of activation differences can be influenced by study-specific contrast procedures (i.e., explicit task contrasts, implicit baseline contrasts, parametric modulators) and\/or conditions (i.e., reward > neutral vs. reward > loss) and can be ambiguous as to whether the signed group differences (e.g., risk > no-risk) reflects a difference in the condition of interest (e.g., reward) or the control condition (e.g., neutral) in certain contrasts (e.g., reward > neutral), without simple effects. Moreover, recent work shows common activation patterns across diverse tasks ( ), suggesting a potential lack of cognitive and affective specificity in signed within-task activation differences. Finally, this approach had the added benefit of permitting the inclusion of foci from voxelwise contrasts that did not carry a sign (e.g., F statistics). Subsequently, we performed secondary analyses to examine the consistency of the direction of activation differences associated with substance use risk (hyper- or hypo-activation). We note that MKDA procedures examine spatial consistency of reported foci, not an aggregate meta-analytic effect size, and thus hyper- and hypo-activation coordinates must be run on separate models and entirely null results (no substance use risk activation differences) cannot be readily included (see ( )( ) for discussion). \n\n\n#### Externalizing and Cooccurring Psychopathology. \n  \nGiven that substance use risk and externalizing psychopathology are thought to share underlying features ( ), multiple studies in the corpus included externalizing psychopathology as part of the substance use risk definition (n = 4), or did not exclude subjects with psychiatric disorders (n = 3) (see   for individual study psychopathology inclusion and exclusion). We performed a series of analyses examining the potential impact of externalizing and cooccurring psychopathology on the results of our substance use risk meta-analysis. First, we used MKDA\u2019s \u03c7  (chi-square) test ( ) to examine whether there was a difference in the proportion of studies showing an activation difference when externalizing or other psychopathology was and was not included in the definition of substance use risk. These analyses were constrained to only include voxels that were significant in the primary meta-analyses (see above) and corrected using the false discovery rate. Second, we re-ran the primary meta-analyses after excluding these studies. Finally, we performed a conjunction analysis between the significant meta-analytic clusters from the primary meta-analyses of substance use risk and significant results from a recent meta-analysis of externalizing disorders (disruptive behavior disorders and severe conduct problems; ( )). Published peak coordinates ( ) were handled in the same manner as studies in our meta-analysis: convolved with a sphere with a radius of 15 mm and trimmed to only include grey matter voxels in the SPM MNI template. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity Analyses. \n  \nAs in all meta-analyses, there were a number of methodological and conceptual decision points in this project (see ( ) for discussion). In order to examine the robustness of meta-analytic results to these methodological decision points and investigate variability in the included literature, three sensitivity analyses were performed. Specifically, the primary meta-analyses were sequentially re-run after excluding those studies that 1) had a mean sample age over 20-years-old (n = 2), 2) included subjects with more than experimental substance use in general, or minimal substance use that significantly differed between groups (n = 6, see below), and 5) used targeted voxelwise reporting (n = 8, see below). \n\n\n\n### Data and code availability \n  \nAll data used in this project (coded foci of activation differences) are available in the  . The MKDA code used to perform meta-analyses is freely available via CANLAB ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included Studies. \n  \nSee   for flow diagram and detailed information on study selection. The initial database search yielded a total of 2213 articles. Of these, 76 met initial screen criteria and full-text versions were reviewed for eligibility. Twenty-two studies met all study inclusion criteria, yielding a total of 190 foci (  and  ,  ). \n\n\n### Voxelwise Reporting. \n  \nFollowing established guidelines ( ), the primary reason for screened studies\u2019 exclusion was not using a voxelwise approach (i.e., studies using only region-of-interest analysis (ROI) or ROI-constrained small volume correction(SVC)) (n = 29), with the proportion of exclusion for this criterion comparable to prior meta-analyses (cf., ( )). See   for more discussion. \n\nA more nuanced challenge remains in understanding the impact of \u201cmasking\u201d or targeted voxelwise reporting, where for example, studies limit the report of group differences to voxels where there was a nominal main effect of the task (e.g., task > baseline: cf. ( )( )( )( ) ( )( )( ) or where whole-brain thresholding is performed, but not all foci of significant differences are reported in tables or figures ( ). Here, again following established guidelines ( ), we carefully examined the impact of these targeted voxelwise reporting studies in our corpus (n = 8). Ultimately, targeted voxelwise reporting studies were shown to not bias primary results (see  ). \n\n\n### Demographic Information. \n  \nGiven that we were unable to clarify individual subjects with investigators, it\u2019s possible some subjects were included in more than one of the studies in the corpus. Note however, that none of the studies included identical samples, supporting a relative independence between studies. Furthermore, combining across similar data sets did not change meta-analytic results ( ). Provided this information, the included studies represented approximately 1092 subjects (456 female) with a mean sample age of 15.48 years (range: 10.54\u201323.78) ( ). Demographic information, where available, suggested risk groups were relatively equivalent in number of subjects, gender composition, and IQ ( ). \n\n\n### Current and Prior Substance Use. \n  \nIn the included studies, the modal substance use inclusion criteria were generally consistent with a previous history of \u201cexperimentation only\u201d (cf.,( )), defined as, for example, less than 10 alcoholic drinks, less than five marijuana uses (( ); see   for more information). Five studies exceeded a threshold of substance use experimentation ( )( )( )( )( ), but were retained in the corpus of studies because they included relevant comparisons of family history status or prospective substance use transitions ( ). An additional study included subjects with minimal substance use but reported a significant difference between comparison groups ( ). Nevertheless, these six studies were shown to not bias the primary results in a subsequent sensitivity analyses (see  ). \n\n\n### Publication Bias. \n  \nEstablished procedures for examining publication biasin MKDA (adapted Galbraith plots) indicated that, among the reported studies, there was a positive slope between sample size and the probability of an activation difference in the primary reported cluster, which is opposite to an association driven by publication bias. Furthermore, trim and fill methods indicated the overall effect size estimates from the included studies did not differ from an effect size estimate adjusted for publication bias ( ). \n\n\n### MKDA \n  \nUsing all foci from all included studies (\u2018all studies\u2019 analysis), MKDA revealed the most consistent activation differences associated with substance use risk were located in the striatum, including both dorsal and ventral subdivisions ( ). Follow-up analysis examining the sign of activation differences suggested the dorsal striatum (putamen) was significantly hyper-active across studies ( ). No other brain regions were significant in either the \u2018all studies\u2019 analysis or in analyses examining signed activation differences. \n\nSubgroup analysis using the \u2018all studies\u2019 approach (irrespective of sign) revealed no significant (minimum FDR corrected p-value = .848) differences between prospective prediction (n = 6) and family history (n = 16) studies among striatal voxels identified in the sign-invariant \u2018all studies\u2019 meta-analysis. To this end, the relative proportions of studies with activation differences in the prospective prediction and family history subgroups were similar in the striatum ( ). Prospective prediction and family history subgroups were also approximately equivalent for the risk > non-risk contrast ( ), although the limited number of studies (n = 12: family history = 10, prospective prediction = 2) prevent a reliable statistical inference from these data. \n\n\n### MKDA: Task Subdomains. \n  \nWhen sub-setting studies based on the type of neuroimaging task used, MKDA indicated that consistent activation differences in the striatum occurred during reward tasks (n = 6), but not cognitive control tasks (n = 9) ( ). The former result was qualitatively similar when analyzing a broader   affective   subdomain by additionally including studies using emotional stimuli (n = 10). No new brain regions were identified when only analyzing the cognitive control tasks (n = 9). \n\n\n### Externalizing and Cooccurring Psychopathology. \n  \nStriatal activation differences in the sign-invariant \u2018all studies\u2019 analysis were significantly more common (FDR corrected q < 0.05) among those studies whose substance use risk definition included externalizing psychopathology (n = 4) versus those whose did not (n = 18) ( ). These results were unchanged when aggregating the externalizing substance use risk studies (n = 4) with the studies who more broadly did not exclude for psychopathology (n = 3, 7 studies total) ( ) or when removing these studies from the analysis completely. The analyses from the \u2018risk > non-risk\u2019 contrast were limited in statistical power but also suggested that cooccurring psychopathology may have driven the results of these analyses (  and  ). Given the relatively large meta-analytic differences observed as a function of externalizing and cooccurring psychopathology, we re-ran the main meta-analyses while excluding the externalizing studies (n = 4) and while excluding the externalizing studies plus the other psychopathology studies (n = 3, 7 studies total). In both cases, no voxelwise significant (FWER threshold of p < .05 with a single voxel alpha of .01) meta-analytic substance use risk effects were observed when removing studies that included cooccurring psychopathology, although it\u2019s possible this reflects limitations in statistical power (see   section). Nevertheless, these results are consistent with a well-established behavioral literature suggesting externalizing psychopathology is a critical factor in adolescent vulnerability to substance use ( )(see ( ) for review). Providing further support for our striatal results as implicated in externalizing psychopathology, a conjunction analysis of the significant voxels in the \u2018all studies\u2019 meta-analysis and convolved spheres created from all the significant coordinates of a recent meta-analysis of disruptive behavioral disorders revealed overlapping voxels in the striatum ( ). When restricting this analysis to those locations that implicated   increased activation  , both studies suggested hyper-activation (i.e., risk > non-risk & externalizing > control) in the dorsal striatum, although the implicated voxels did not overlap ( ). \n\n\n### MKDA: Sensitivity Analyses. \n  \nSignificant striatal activation differences from the \u2018all studies\u2019 meta-analysis (n = 22) were observed across all three sensitivity analyses ( , ). In contrast, hyper-activation of the striatum from the \u2018risk > no-risk\u2019 metanalysis, which overall included fewer studies (n = 12), was observed when excluding studies with a mean sample age over 20-years-old (studies excluded: n = 2, studies included: n = 10), but only marginally (4 significant voxels) observed when excluding studies with subjects differing or having more than experimental substance use (studies excluded: n = 3, studies included: n = 9) and not significant when excluding studies with targeted voxelwise reporting (studies excluded: n = 3, studies included: n = 9)( ,  ). However, within the limited number of studies, it is difficult to determine whether this result represents true variability driven by methodological differences or rather limited statistical power. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Existing neuroimaging studies of adolescent substance use vulnerability \n  \nThe results from our systematic literature search highlight a growing and diverse literature of neuroimaging studies of adolescent substance use vulnerability. As in many emerging literatures, there is significant heterogeneity in methodology. For example, a challenge faced in the current voxelwise meta-analyses was the high number of region of interest (ROI) or ROI-constrained small volume correction (SVC) studies, which due to potentially biased type 1 and type 2 error rates, limit the ability to make comprehensive inferences regarding vulnerability markers of substance use risk from the entirety of the literature. Accordingly, we suggest the field moves toward sharing of un-thresholded statistical images (cf., ( ) ( ) or full data sets via online repositories (NeuroVault and OpenNeuro), which would permit more sophisticated image-based meta-analyses ( ). The field may also consider including supplementary whole-brain voxelwise results within ROI-based studies, which would likewise support future data integration. Another observation from our meta-analysis and prior literature reviews (e.g., ( )) is the relative predominance of studies using reward and cognitive control tasks. While this trend likely reflects dominant reward-cognition theories of adolescent substance use vulnerability, more widespread use of alternative tasks, such as those using emotional or substance use stimuli and\/or more complex integrated rewarded-cognitive tasks, may help disambiguate broader neural circuitry associated with substance use vulnerability. Furthermore, our systematic literature search reveals various tasks within the broad domains of reward and cognition. While this task heterogeneity has the advantage of providing potential specificity in the indexed cognitive and affective processes, replication studies and\/or multi-task paradigms that provide an opportunity for replication would help in data aggregation efforts to examine the robustness of specific cognitive (response inhibition vs. working memory) and affective (reward anticipation vs. reward consumption) processes implicated in substance use vulnerability. \n\nIn addition to and in light of the methodological and reporting patterns across the existing literature, our systematic literature search and meta-analysis support the notion that this is a still-emerging field. Therefore, the results of the current meta-analysis and the broader field should be interpreted within this context. For example, due to sampling variability, early studies with small sample sizes typically have greater error and a larger degree of heterogeneity across studies in effect sizes than later studies with larger samples. Accordingly, as the field continues to develop, and larger studies are available for both prospective prediction and family history analysis (e.g., ABCD study: ( )), our ability to fully disambiguate neuroimaging markers of substance use vulnerability will continue to improve. This point is particularly true for determining whether null results are truly null, or simply require increased statistical power to detect. In addition to larger studies, increased data sharing can help move the field towards better meta-analytic techniques and more comprehensive neural correlates. \n\n\n### Dual risk model for adolescent substance use \n  \nWithin the context of the performed meta-analysis, we aimed to test the \u2018dual-risk\u2019 theory of adolescent substance use vulnerability. This neurodevelopmental theory suggests vulnerability to problematic substance use is driven, in part, by an exaggeration of adolescents\u2019 enhanced reward drive, mediated by the striatum ( )( )( ) (see ( ) for review). Consistent with this perspective, our meta-analytic results indicate adolescent substance use risk was most associated with striatal activation differences. Moreover, subdomain analysis suggested activation differences may be specific to motivational context, as striatal differences were observed in studies using reward tasks but not in studies using cognitive control tasks. We were also able to determine substance use risk was associated with   increased   striatal activation among the corpus of studies, potentially supporting the dual-risk model\u2019s conceptualization of an overactive reward system. \n\nImportantly however, our meta-analytic results suggest nuance in the involvement of the striatum in substance use vulnerability. For example, while striatal activation differences appeared to be driven by tasks with a shared motivational\/reward context, the specific affective components indexed by the contrasts were quite diverse (e.g., winning rewards -neutral condition; risky \u2013 safe decisions:  ). Accordingly, as has been suggested by previous work ( ), observed striatal effects may represent broader, motivational salience, rather than reward and positive valence-specific processes. Furthermore, when examining signed activation differences, hyper-activation was observed in the dorsal striatum (putamen), which compared to the ventral striatum, may support action selection and habit formation ( ) more than the signaling of primary rewards. As an additional complexity, due to the limited number of studies, our subdomain analyses had lower statistical power than our \u2018all studies\u2019 analyses and we were unable to examine meta-analytic differences subdivided by various stages and types of reward processing (e.g., reward anticipation and reward receipt), limiting a comprehensive and computational account of reward function in adolescent substance use risk. Furthermore, striatal activation differences appeared to be critically driven by the cooccurrence of externalizing psychopathology, which prompts a potential distinction between normative adolescent substance use vulnerability and potential trait-level substance use risk factors. Taken together, the current striatal results suggest substance use vulnerability may be characterized by a specific sensitivity to compulsivity and goal-undirected behavior, rather than simply an increased reward drive, but further research into the underlying reward functions of adolescent substance use risk is needed. \n\nPotentially contradicting additional predictions from neurodevelopmental models, our meta-analysis did not identify cognitive control-related prefrontal regions as a reliable neural correlate of substance use vulnerability in any stage of the analysis. However, given the relatively small amount of studies, the null results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with some degree of caution. Beyond limits of statistical power, it is also possible that prefrontal activation differences were not observed due to performance differences associated with substance use risk, as individual differences in cognitive control tasks have been shown to moderate prefrontal activation ( ). In the current project however, we did not examine the impact of reported cognitive performance differences, owing to the fact that studies did not consistently report performance differences and the available metrics differed in response type (reaction time versus accuracy) and cognitive demands. Similarly, it is possible the task conditions from the included studies did not consistently engage more complex cognitive response processes known to recruit prefrontal activation (cf., ( )). Another possibility is that prefrontal activation differences may only be reliably observed in samples younger than the ages best represented by this corpus of studies, or in the context of varying developmental trajectories (cf., ( )), as recruitment of the prefrontal cortex undergoes normative changes until mid-adolescence, when it reaches adult levels ( ). Nevertheless, provided the current meta-analytic results and the reported inconsistency in previous literature reviews (c.f., ( ) ( )), it is possible that cognitive control-related prefrontal regions may serve a more secondary role in determining adolescent risk for problematic substance use. Supporting this, multiple theoretical perspectives ( )( ) and a recent meta-analysis ( ) suggest dysfunction of cortically-mediated cognitive control systems acts as a common, transdiagnostic risk factor for psychiatric disorders. To this end, cortical activation differences may serve as non-specific indicators of clinical severity, an explanation which would account for the frequent association of lateral prefrontal and related posterior parietal activation differences in comparisons of early versus late substance use initiation ( )( ), where early substance use typically occurs in the context of a broad high-risk profile ( ). This idea is supported by longitudinal behavioral research demonstrating that cognitive control deficits are predictive of symptoms of externalizing psychopathology (conduct disorder), while reward responses are specifically associated with substance use (binge drinking) ( ). \n\n\n### Towards an updated model of adolescent substance use risk \n  \nIn the broadest terms, our results prompt a possible distinction between normative neurodevelopmental models and adolescent markers of vulnerability to problematic substance use. Although adolescence is widely viewed as a period of vulnerability to substance use initiation and escalation, the transition into problematic substance use and addiction is thought to be driven by multiple neurobiological factors (See  ). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of adolescent substance use vulnerability should include further work examining the relative specificity of normative developmental processes during adolescence and more developmentally-stable trait-level substance use vulnerability factors, such as family environment and parenting, history of trauma, and familial psychopathology other than substance use disorder. \n\n#### Defining Substance Use Risk. \n  \nGiven the diversity of potential risk factors for substance use disorders and their possible distinction between normative adolescent function, operationally defining substance use risk remains a challenge. The current meta-analysis focused on two of the primary ways of operationalizing adolescent vulnerability to substance use by identifying studies that examined participants with a family history of a substance use disorder or those who would later initiate or escalate their substance use. These definitions have the advantage of isolating substance use risk without requiring existing significant current substance use. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, there are a number of other potential substance use risk factors that may provide converegent information regading substance use vulnerability. \n\nA particular focus of the current project and the broader field is that of externalizing psychopathology, which is associated with early substance use initiation ( ), relatively early onset of substance use disorders ( ), and has been conceptualized as part of a transdiagnostic dimension that includes substance use disorders ( ). Given the common co-occurrence of externalizing disorders and problematic substance use, existing studies, including those in the current meta-analysis, have frequently used definitions of substance use risk that include externalizing psychopathology. However, as has been suggested previously ( ) and supported by the current project, this may lead to variability in the literature. Specifically, our results suggested striatal activation differences in substance use risk may be moderated by the co-occurrence of externalizing psychopathology. To this end, the lack of externalizing differences might explain, for example, a recent sizeable sample that failed to show striatal activation differences between family history positive and family history negative subjects during a modified monetary incentive delay task ( ). Nevertheless, while the current results may point towards externalizing psychopathology as a potential moderator or mediator of substance use risk differences, more studies and increased data sharing are required to fully disambiguate these challenges. Notably, increased data sharing would permit more sophisticated image-based meta-analyses ( ) that, unlike coordinate-based meta-analysis, can incorporate entirely null studies (e.g., ( )) and provide critical information on overall effect sizes. \n\n\n#### Substance Use Risk and Addiction. \n  \nIn addition to providing clarity on variability among the substance use risk literature, the current meta-analysis may also provide context for the existing addiction literature. For example, while the potential primary role of the striatum in adolescent substance use vulnerability differs from the neurodevelopmental literature, multiple models from the addiction literature have emphasized a particular role of the striatum and reward systems in substance use progression. \n\nA general \u201cimpulsivity theory\u201d (cited from ( )) has suggested addiction, and thus potentially addiction vulnerability, is the result of a hyper-functioning striatum and reward system ( )( ) that may manifest as a trait-level behavioral feature,   impulsivity  . Similarly, allostasis theory predicts increased striatal dopamine functioning and impulsivity mediate early experiences with drugs of abuse ( ). These perspectives have the advantage of accounting for the association between impulsive behavioral phenotypes, including disorders of the externalizing spectrum (e.g., oppositional defiance, conduct disorder), and problematic substance use, which were supported by the current project\u2019s results showing the potential moderating or mediating role of externalizing psychopathology on activation difference associated with substance use risk. \n\nComplimentary to theories concerning an early bias towards substance use, other perspectives highlight the dynamic pharmacological interactions between drugs of abuse and brain function. For example, both incentive salience theory ( ) and allostasis theory ( ) suggest drugs of abuse lead to neuro-adaptations in the striatum, which ultimately lead to substance use escalation. The current meta-analytic results of striatal dysfunction that precede problematic substance use may signal a vulnerability to these later neuroadaptations. An advantage of this perspective, wherein pre-existing individual differences predict the course of substance use escalation, is that it might account for the observation of substance use risk factors (externalizing symptoms: ( ), ( ); family history of SUD: ( )) to predict both early onset and more problematic substance use. Nevertheless, future longitudinal neuroimaging research, equipped to parse pre-existing between-subject differences and within-subject escalation of substance use (e.g., ABCD study: ( )), are required to test these predictions. Such dense longitudinal neuroimaging research can also assist in examining cortical control areas that may serve as secondary markers of clinical severity and substance use risk. Additionally, longitudinal analyses of functional connectivity may help clarify potential interactions between cortical control and striatal regions in problematic substance use and related forms of psychopathology. \n\n\n#### Dorsal versus Ventral Striatal Dysfunction. \n  \nAn intriguing result from the current project is the potential distinction between dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the striatum in substance use risk. For example, striatal hyper-activation in substance use risk was more associated with the dorsal subdivision of the striatum, which has also been implicated in a prior meta-analysis of externalizing psychopathology ( ). While we have reviewed theories of addiction in the context of the striatum generally, growing evidence suggests a functional distinction between dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the striatum. For example, work in rodents and humans has suggested that, whereas the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse are mediated by the ventral striatum, the relative locus of behavioral control transitions to the dorsal striatum during habitual substance use ( )( ). Given the current meta-analysis isolated substance use risk prior to significant substance use involvement, our results may support prior suggestions of a relative predisposition to compulsivity or habit formation ( ) that co-occurs with externalizing psychopathology (e.g., trait-level impulsivity). Again however, large longitudinal studies are required to further test these predictions. \n\n\n\n### Study limitations \n  \nAs the first neuroimaging meta-analysis of adolescent substance use vulnerability, this study highlights essential targets for future research and theory development. However, as in any analysis, there are important limitations to consider. First, as mentioned above, due to the large number of studies using only region-of-interest, small volume correction, or multi-step procedures, and our general use of published coordinates, this meta-analysis was limited to a subset of the broader literature. While we took steps to contact authors and examine repositories for unthresholded statistical volumes to try and increase the potential number of included studies, this limitation reflects general analysis and reporting practices. With respect to the current project, the total number of studies included in the primary meta-analysis (n = 22) is comparable to simulation studies (n \u2265 20; ( )) and other recent meta-analyses of clinical phenotypes. However, due to the limitations raised above, we were limited in our ability to fully explore heterogeneity in this emerging literature. For example, the performed subgroup (e.g., family history and prospective studies) and subdomain (e.g., cognitive control and reward tasks) analyses relied on restricted subsets of studies. Likewise, due to the limited number of studies, we were not able to complete separate analyses on stimulus types within each task domain (i.e., reward anticipation versus reward receipt). Furthermore, we were unable to restrict our analyses to studies using entirely drug na\u00efve youth (see  ), which would help disambiguate the current markers of vulnerability to   problematic   substance use with those associated with substance use   initiation  . Finally, due to the limited number of studies, and in particular, the limited number of prospective prediction studies, we focused our analyses on commonalities across family history and prospective prediction studies. However, this prevented us from fully exploring heterogeneity within family history studies, as well as differences between family history and prospective prediction studies that can provide critical information on the distinction between risk and resilience to substance use disorders. \n\nAnother limitation of the current project and all meta-analyses of clinical phenotypes is that spatial locations of activation differences may be constrained by the types of neuroimaging tasks included in the literature. For example, few studies in our meta-analysis employed tasks using emotional stimuli, which may have limited our indentification of reliable neuroimaging markers of substance use risk in the amygdala and para-limbic systems supporting emotional processing. In addition to this limitation on spatial sensitivity, coordinate-based meta-analyses are limited in spatial specificity by the size of the kernel that is convolved with the reported coordinate. Based on recommendations from simulation ( ), the current project used a sphere with a radius of 15 mm. However, by definition, this procedure limits the certainty of spatial estimates. Finally, the goal of coordinate-based meta-analyses is to determine spatial convergence of reported coordinates, which differs from an \u201ceffect-size\u201d meta-analysis typically found in behavioral research. Accordingly, the results from the current meta-analysis should be viewed as a quantitative integration of the included published brain regions implicated in substance use risk, but not for the overall prevalence of such effects. Therefore, while the MKDA procedures we used have been designed to provide results that generalize to new studies, the current results should be interpreted within the context of the included studies and we suggest further quantitative integration in this literature. Ultimately, improved spatial sensitivity and specificity, and meta-analyses of \u201ceffect size\u201d (i.e., image based meta-analysis ( )) will require data sharing of either unthresholded statistical volumes (NeuroVault,  ) or full data sets (OpenNeuro,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, the current meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence for a more primary role of striatal dysfunction in adolescent vulnerability to substance use, with limited support for prefrontal activation differences hypothesized in \u2018dual-risk\u2019 models. We propose hyper-activation of the striatum, possibly through a dimensional predisposition to compulsivity and habit formation shared with externalizing psychopathology, may predict later problematic substance use. However, more studies and increased data sharing are necessary; ary for a comprehensive understanding of the neuroimaging markers of adolescent substance use risk. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7992390,"text_md5":"56cbcf6e5dc9dc46c10c3feaf208e72d","field_positions":{"authors":[0,102],"journal":[103,113],"publication_year":[115,119],"title":[130,246],"keywords":[260,400],"abstract":[413,3145],"body":[3154,53568]},"batch":2,"pmid":31875520,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2019.116476","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7992390","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7992390"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7992390\">7992390<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7992390  Meta-analysis and review of functional neuroimaging differences underlying adolescent vulnerability to substance use"}

Seed-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in subjects at increased risk of developing psychosis have begun to identify abnormalities in rsFC, although reported findings remain mixed. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of seed-based resting-state fMRI studies to test whether high-risk subjects show rsFC alterations relative to healthy controls within and between the default mode network (DMN), control executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA literature search was performed to identify seed-based resting-state fMRI studies comparing subjects with genetic risk factors, psychotic-like experiences, and clinical high-risk for psychosis to healthy controls. Then, coordinates of seed regions were extracted and categorized into networks by their location within a priori templates. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) analysis examined the reported coordinates for hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity with each a priori network. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe meta-analysis included 15 studies (774 subjects at risk, 628 healthy controls) on clinical high-risk for psychosis, 6 studies (123 subjects at risk, 147 healthy controls) on psychotic-like experiences, and 5 studies (173 subjects at risk, 256 healthy controls) on genetic risk factors of developing psychosis. We found specific patterns of hypo- and hyper-connectivity within and between large-scale networks. Our results showed that subjects with high-risk for psychosis were characterized by hypo-connectivity within the SN and CEN and hyper-connectivity within the DMN and CEN. Network seeds in the DMN, CEN, and SN displayed hyper-connectivity with regions in other networks. The DMN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the CEN, while CEN and SN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the DMN. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis provides evidence that subjects at risk for psychosis present distinctive abnormalities of hyper- and hypo-connectivity within and between the DMN, CEN and SN, particularly implicating network dys-connectivity as a core deficit underlying the psychopathology of psychosis in the preclinical phase. More studies are needed to investigate whether subjects at risk to develop psychosis present patterns of dysfunction between the rsFC of healthy subjects and that of patients with established psychosis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n","metadata":{"pmcid":7234455,"text_md5":"a42e0e5302fd04d67dea26ad44a1567c","field_positions":{"authors":[0,129],"journal":[130,144],"publication_year":[146,150],"title":[161,318],"keywords":[332,332],"abstract":[345,2963],"body":[2972,2972]},"batch":2,"doi":"10.1093\/schbul\/sbaa029.716","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7234455","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234455"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7234455\">7234455<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7234455  T156.

Y.\nMol Autism, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nDifferential mirror neuron system (MNS) activation during action observation with and without social-emotional components in autism: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies\n\n# Keywords\n\nMeta-analysis\nAutism\nAction observation\nMirror neuron\nEmotion\nfMRI\nES-SDM\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nImpaired imitation has been found to be an important factor contributing to social communication deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It has been hypothesized that the neural correlate of imitation, the mirror neuron system (MNS), is dysfunctional in ASD, resulting in imitation impairment as one of the key behavioral manifestations in ASD. Previous MNS studies produced inconsistent results, leaving the debate of whether \u201cbroken\u201d mirror neurons in ASD are unresolved. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis meta-analysis aimed to explore the differences in MNS activation patterns between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals when they observe biological motions with or without social-emotional components. Effect size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) was adopted to synthesize the available fMRI data. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nES-SDM analysis revealed hyperactivation in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left supplementary motor area in ASD during observation of biological motions. Subgroup analysis of experiments involving the observation of stimuli with or without emotional component revealed hyperactivation in the left inferior parietal lobule and left supplementary motor during action observation without emotional components, whereas hyperactivation of the right inferior frontal gyrus was found during action observation with emotional components in ASD. Subgroup analyses of age showed hyperactivation of the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus in ASD adolescents, while hyperactivation in the right inferior frontal gyrus was noted in ASD adults. Meta-regression within ASD individuals indicated that the right cerebellum crus I activation increased with age, while the left inferior temporal gyrus activation decreased with age. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis meta-analysis is limited in its generalization of the findings to individuals with ASD by the restricted age range, heterogeneous study sample, and the large within-group variation in MNS activation patterns during object observation. Furthermore, we only included action observation studies which might limit the generalization of our results to the imitation deficits in ASD. In addition, the relatively small sample size for individual studies might also potentially overestimate the effect sizes. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe MNS is impaired in ASD. The abnormal activation patterns were found to be modulated by the nature of stimuli and age, which might explain the contradictory results from earlier studies on the \u201cbroken mirror neuron\u201d debate. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 59 people worldwide [ ]. Individuals with ASD are characterized by social communication deficits, e.g., difficulties in the production and comprehension of nonverbal gestures, as well as restricted and repetitive interests, that manifest very early in their lives. Such deficits significantly impair their social and occupational functioning [ ], with previous studies showing that greater dysfunction in social communication skills predicted reduced participation in social and recreational activities in adolescence and adulthood [ ]. In the past decade, researchers have attempted to identify critical components underlying lifelong social communication difficulties in ASD, one of which is the deficit in imitation. \n\nImitation, defined as the ability to simultaneously observe and replicate an action displayed by another person [ ,  ], has been considered an important skill for early social and intellectual development [ ]. Research with typically developing (TD) individuals has revealed that imitative skills progressively develop from the imitation of simple actions to the imitation of complicated gestures in the first 2 years of life as a child continuously interacts with the environment [ ]. This developmental trajectory of imitation, however, has been found to be delayed in individuals with autism [ ]. Moreover, imitation is a form of social learning, and deficits in imitation was found to be a significant predictor of communication development and intellectual outcomes in children with ASD [ ,  ]. These studies collectively suggest that impaired imitation early in life contributes to the behavioral manifestations in ASD. \n\nIt has been proposed that the mirror neuron system (MNS) supports the ability to imitate in humans [ ,  ]. The MNS is a neural circuit involving interconnected brain regions that process information related to the perception and execution of biological motions [ ,  ]. Although the definition of MNS brain regions is sometimes debatable [ ], some regions are well-established to be considered as the components of MNS, including the premotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule [ ]. Some of these brain regions, i.e., supplementary motor area (part of the premotor cortex), have been shown to contain mirror neurons with single-cell recording [ ], in which neurons in these brain regions were found to discharge both \u201cwhen individuals perform a given motor act and when individuals observe another person performing a motor act with a similar goal\u201d [ ]. With the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation method (i.e., the ability of a brain region to adapt to repetitively displayed stimuli [ ]), researchers have preliminarily shown that inferior frontal gyrus [ ] and inferior parietal lobule [ ] might also contain mirror neurons. The MNS is connected to other brain regions that support imitation by providing sensory\/perceptual\/affective inputs to frontal and parietal mirror neuron regions [ ]. Previous research has shown that the organization of the MNS is task-specific. For example, imitation of actions without emotional components involves the MNS, as well as superior temporal sulcus and visual cortex for visual processing [ ,  ]. Imitation of actions with emotional components, in contrast, might recruit different brain regions when compared with imitating actions without emotions [ ]. For instance, cortical regions for face processing (i.e., fusiform face area [ ]) and visual attention\/attentional control to face stimuli (i.e., inferior occipital gyrus [ ] \/mid-cingulate cortex [ ]), as well as subcortical regions for emotional processing (e.g., amygdala [ ]) were found to be coactivated with MNS during the imitation of facial emotional expressions. \n\nGiven that the MNS is a plausible neural correlate for imitation, individuals with ASD, who have been found to have impairments in imitation, has been hypothesized to show a dysfunctional MNS. A number of fMRI studies have been conducted to compare the activation patterns of the MNS in ASD individuals with age- and\/or IQ-matched TD controls during the observation of biological motions. The visual stimuli used in these fMRI studies can largely be classified into two categories: 1) biological motions without social-emotional component, such as object manipulation with hands [ ] or feet [ ] and 2) biological motions with social-emotional components, such as human faces or bodily gestures expressing different emotions [ \u2013 ]. These fMRI studies, however, have presented inconsistent results. For example, in a study in which images without social-emotional components were presented to participants, greater activation in the right dorsal premotor cortex (a brain region with mirror neurons) was recorded in ASD participants than in TD participants [ ]. A similar action observation paradigm was adopted by Pokorny et al. [ ], although they did not find significant differences in brain activation within the MNS between ASD and TD participants. With respect to the observation of stimuli with social-emotional components, there have also been inconsistencies. For example, Kim et al. [ ] and Sato et al. [ ] displayed both happy and fearful faces to participants with and without ASD. Kim et al. [ ] reported that ASD individuals exhibited a reduction in activation in some MNS regions (i.e., inferior frontal gyrus and amygdala) in the right brain only, while Sato et al. [ ] reported reductions in bilateral activation in these regions. These contradictory results have led us to two important questions regarding MNS function in individuals with ASD: Is the MNS truly dysfunctional in individuals with ASD? If their MNS is dysfunctional, how can the previous contradictory findings be explained? \n\nSummarizing the available data with meta-analytic methods would be helpful for us to answer these questions. To our knowledge, one relevant meta-analysis has been conducted. Rather than including all MNS studies regardless of the nature of stimuli (with\/without social-emotional components), this meta-analysis included only the data from action observation and imitation studies without social-emotional components among adolescents and adults (mean age = 12\u201333) with and without ASD using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method [ ]. From the 13 (including four imitation and nine action observation studies) studies, the meta-analytic data revealed greater activation in the ASD than TD individuals at the right anterior inferior parietal lobule, a brain region with mirror neurons. This study appeared to provide some evidence that part of the MNS might be dysfunctional in individuals with ASD during action processing without social-emotional components. However, whether there is a deficit in MNS regardless of the nature of stimuli remains unclear. Additionally, having found that the neural network required for different visual stimuli might account for the discrepancies in fluctuating behavioral performance in individuals with ASD [ ,  ], it is reasonable to postulate that the nature of stimuli presented to trigger MNS activities may play a role in explaining the inconsistent results. Furthermore, provided that the gray matter volumes in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, where mirror neurons are situated, atypically decline in ASD compared with TD individuals starting from early adolescence (age 10\u201315) through adulthood [ ], the age of participants across different studies may be another factor modulating the inconsistent results. An updated meta-analysis including all fMRI studies that investigated the MNS in ASD would thus be essential to draw conclusions regarding these unanswered questions, as well as to suggest hypotheses to guide future studies. \n\nThis meta-analysis aimed to explore the differences in MNS activation patterns between TD and ASD individuals when they observe\/imitate biological motions with\/without emotional components. Effect size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM), a mixed voxel-based meta-analytic method, was adopted [ ] to synthesize the available fMRI data. \n\nIt was hypothesized that the MNS activation patterns were different between TD and ASD individuals; such differences in activation patterns would be modulated by the nature of the stimuli (i.e., biological motions with\/without social-emotional components) and age (i.e., adolescent\/adult). Meta-regressions, enabled by the ES-SDM, were also performed to explore clusters that exhibited statistically significant changes in activation across ages in ASD and TD individuals. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline [ ]. A literature search was conducted from August to October 2019 by two research assistants (I.C. and T.C.); a second search was then conducted around 1 month before this review was submitted for publication (i.e., 7 January 2020) to ensure that the data included in this study were as up-to-date as possible. To identify relevant studies, the electronic databases PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were used with the primary keywords \u201cmirror neuron\u201d, \u201cmirroring\u201d, \u201caction observation\u201d, and \u201cimitation\u201d and secondary keywords \u201cautism\u201d, \u201cautistic\u201d, \u201cautism spectrum disorder\u201d, \u201cautism spectrum condition\u201d, \u201cASD\u201d, and \u201cASC\u201d together with tertiary keywords \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d. No limit was set to the publication dates. A manual search of the reference lists in previously published review papers [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ] was also conducted to identify possible studies for the current review. \n\n\n### Study inclusion \n  \nThe article screening process was divided into three phases. Duplicated records were first removed, followed by the screening of title and abstracts of the remaining records to identify relevant studies. The following exclusion criteria were applied during title and abstract screening: 1) nonhuman studies, 2) treatment-related studies, 3) studies without an English version of the full text, 4) studies without empirical findings (e.g., book chapters, study protocols, and review papers), 5) studies that did not contain an experimental group with participants diagnosed with ASD and a healthy control group, 6) non-fMRI studies, and 7) resting fMRI studies. Finally, full texts of the included studies were further assessed for the eligibility of being included in the meta-analysis. Studies were excluded if 1) peak coordinates\/raw statistical parametric maps could not be obtained from the published papers\/contacted authors or 2) analyses were limited to specific regions of interest (ROIs). For included studies that reported results from more than one action observation experiments, we extracted and pooled the results from all eligible experiments into our analysis [ ]. Additionally, although the meta-analysis of the human brain networks has provided evidence for common neural correlates of action observation and action imitation, the activation patterns related to action observation and imitation differed within the MNS regions [ ]. Within this context, we believed that action observation and imitation studies should be analyzed separately. Based on our preliminary search, we observed that the number of imitation studies would not be sufficient to conduct separate analysis with adequate power, which is an important factor to be considered in conducting coordinate-based meta-analysis [ ], we have excluded 6 studies [ \u2013 ] that only presented results on action imitation. The above screening processes were independently conducted by the first author and an experienced research assistant (I.C.), and their decisions were recorded on separate Excel spreadsheets. When there were discrepancies, the second author made the final decision. \n\n\n### Data extraction and recoding \n  \nThe demographic data, experimental details, and fMRI data of the included papers were extracted and entered into a database by the first author and checked by the second author to minimize errors. Demographic data included the sample size of each experimental and control group, mean IQ, mean age, ratio of sex (female:male), and group-matching criteria. The mean age was then recoded into two age groups, namely the adolescent group (mean age of participants 17:11 or below) and the adult group (studies recruited participants aged 18 or above). Experimental details included the descriptions about the action observation stimuli presented in the individual experiments, the body parts presented in the stimuli, and the baseline comparison. To compare the brain activation between ASD and TD individuals separately for observation of stimuli with and without social-emotional component, we classified the studies into these categories based on the following criteria: a study was classified under the subgroup \u201cwithout social-emotional component\u201d if it 1) did not present any body parts that convey emotional expressions in the visual stimuli (i.e., non-emotional condition) and 2a) did not involve more than one actor in the visual stimuli or 2b) did not present communicative (e.g., waving and hand-shaking) gestures (i.e., non-social condition) [ ]. If a study failed to meet any one or both of the criteria, it was grouped under the subgroup \u201cwith social-emotional component\u201d. Notably, if a study presented neutral facial expression as the stimuli, we classified it under the subgroup \u201cwith social-emotional component\u201d, as suggested by previous studies which indicated that neutral faces might in fact be associated with positive or negative emotions [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nAll meta-analytic procedures were performed using the ES-SDM software [ ].To compare the overall differences in MNS activation patterns between the ASD and TD individuals during the observation of stimuli with and without emotional components, all data from individual studies were pooled and meta-analyzed using the maximum likelihood random effects model. To evaluate the effects of the nature of tasks in the differences in MNS activation patterns between patient and control groups, random effects analyses were performed between the two groups for the subgroups of studies presented visual stimuli \u201cwith social-emotional component\u201d and \u201cwithout social-emotional component\u201d. To evaluate the effects of age on the between-group differences in MNS activation patterns, data from studies were meta-analyzed separately for the \u201cadolescent\u201d and \u201cadult\u201d subgroups. Considering the known effects of age [ ], intelligence quotient (IQ [ ]), and gender [ ] that contributed to the heterogeneity of the ASD population, as well as the different body parts involved in various studies that might possibly confound the brain activation [ ], we conducted supplementary analyses that included age, IQ, gender, and the body part involved in the visual stimuli as covariates to control for the effects of these factors on brain activations in ASD and TD. All of the aforementioned analyses were performed by subtracting the activation map of the ASD group by the activation map of the TD group (i.e., ASD\u2013TD contrast). To supplement the evaluation of age effects on MNS activation, brain regions that exhibited significant changes in activation within the ASD group at both adolescent and adult subgroups were explored by performing meta-regression with the mean age of participants of each study. This was a simple linear regression weighted by the squared root of sample size and restricted to predict only possible SDM values (i.e., from \u2212 1 to 1) in the observed range of values of the chosen variable (i.e., participants\u2019 mean age [ ];). As in previous studies, the significance level of the main analyses was kept at   p   < 0.005, which requires a peak   Z   > 1 with a cluster size of 10 voxels, as suggested by Radua et al. [ ] to optimize the sensitivity of results while controlling for type I error. The significance level of the meta-regression analyses was kept at   p   < 0.0005 to avoid false-positive results [ ]. To evaluate the risk of reporting bias across studies, test for funnel plot asymmetry was conducted. This test examined whether the relationship between an estimated effect size and study size was greater than chance [ ]. Funnel plots were generated for visual inspection of potential publication bias. In the presence of publication bias, the plot would be symmetrical at the top and data points would increasingly be missing from the middle to the bottom parts of the plot [ ]. Egger\u2019s tests [ ] were then performed for the peak coordinates of brain regions showing differences between ASD and TD during action observation. Significant Egger\u2019s tests indicate \u201csmall study effects\u201d. Sometimes, smaller studies would in fact yield larger effects than studies with a larger sample size [ ], this might be due to publication bias [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nA total of 543 studies were retrieved. After 157 duplicate records were removed, titles and abstracts of 386 records were screened. With exclusion criteria applied, 326 records were excluded, with 60 records remaining for the full-text screening. During full-text screening, 40 records were further excluded. The complete process of article selection is outlined in Fig.\u2009 .\n   \nFlowchart of the article screening process \n  \n\n\n### Characteristics of the included studies \n  \nA total of 20 action observation studies (including 24 experiments) were included in the meta-analysis, which represented 284 individuals with ASD (111 adolescents and 173 adults) compared with 290 matched, typically developing controls (114 adolescents and 176 adults). Nine studies (with nine experiments) presented biological motions without social-emotional components [ \u2013 ], and the remaining 13 studies (with 15 experiments) presented biological motions with social-emotional components [ ,  ,  \u2013 ]. The demographic data of the participants and the experimental details of each study are summarized in Table\u2009 .\n   \nTwenty fMRI action observation studies (with 24 experiments) included in the meta-analysis \n  \n ASD-H   High-functioning autism spectrum disorder,   TD   Typically-developing,   ADOS   Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,   ADI-R   Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2014Revised,   Age   chronological age only,   IQ   full-scale IQ only,   Education   years of education \n  \n\n\n### Global differences in MNS activation patterns between ASD and TD individuals during action observation (Table  ) \n  \nDuring the observation of actions with and without social-emotional components, it was found that people with autism exhibited hyperactivation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part; BA45, BA47), left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left inferior parietal lobule (BA40; brain clusters highlighted in red in Fig.  ). In contrast, hypoactivation was observed in the cluster of the left precentral gyrus (BA6), right amygdala and right cerebellum hemispheric lobule VI (brain clusters highlighted in blue in Fig.  ). All clusters remained statistically significant (ps\u2009<\u20090.005) with ratio of sex, mean age, or body parts as covariates. Moreover, with the exception of left inferior parietal lobule, our results remained significant when mean IQ or both mean age and mean IQ were included as covariates.\n   \nGlobal differences in MNS activation during action observation \n    \nDifference in MNS activation between ASD and TD during action observation.

Meanwhile, the individuals with ASD also showed hypoactivation in the middle occipital gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and left cerebellum crus I (Fig.  a). All clusters remained statistically significant (ps\u2009<\u20090.005) with ratio of sex, mean age, mean IQ, or body parts as covariates. Additionally, with the exception of right postcentral gyrus and left cerebellum crus I, our findings remained significant when mean age and mean IQ were included as covariates.\n   \nDifference in MNS activation between ASD and TD during observation of stimuli without social-emotional components \n    \nDifference in MNS activation between ASD and TD during observation of stimuli with social-emotional components \n    \nEffects of nature of stimuli and age in MNS activation between ASD and TD.

(Note:   L  \u2009=\u2009left,   R  \u2009=\u2009right) \n  \n\nDuring the observation of stimuli containing social-emotional components, highly significant hyperactivation of the MNS in the ASD individuals was found in the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part). In contrast, hypoactivation of the left cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI) was observed in ASD individuals compared with the TD individuals (Fig.  b). The hyperactivation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part) remained highly significant with ratio of sex, mean age, mean IQ, or body parts as covariates, as well as with mean age and mean IQ as covariates (all ps\u2009<\u20090.005). Furthermore, the hypoactivation of cerebellum remained statistically significant when IQ was included as a covariate. \n\n\n### Effects of age on the differences in MNS activation patterns between ASD and TD individuals (Tables   and  ) \n  \nIn the adolescent subgroup (ASD mean age\u2009=\u200911.3\u201317.6; TD mean age\u2009=\u200911.5\u201317.1; Fig.  c), the ASD individuals showed hyperactivation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis and pars triangularis, right postcentral gyrus extending to the precentral gyrus, and the left supramarginal gyrus extending to the inferior parietal gyrus (BA40, BA2). Hypoactivation in the ASD compared to TD individuals was found in the left fusiform gyrus (BA18, BA19), left cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI), and right median cingulate around the hippocampal region (BA20). With mean age or body part as covariates, all brain clusters remained statistically significant. With ratio of sex as a covariate, all clusters except left supramarginal gyrus remained significant. With mean IQ as a covariate, all clusters except left supramarginal gyrus and left cerebellum hemispheric lobule VI remained significant. With both mean age and mean IQ as covariates, all clusters except left cerebellum hemispheric lobule VI remained significant.\n   \nDifference in MNS activation between ASD and TD in adolescent subgroup \n    \nDifference in MNS activation between ASD and TD in adult subgroup \n  \n\nIn the adult subgroup (ASD mean age\u2009=\u200923\u201337; TD mean age\u2009=\u200921\u201337; Fig.  d), the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part extending to the triangular part) and left supplementary motor area (BA6, BA24) were hyperactivated, whereas the left precentral gyrus extending to the postcentral gyrus (BA6, BA4), and the right cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI extending to crus I) were hypoactivated in the ASD compared with TD individuals. All clusters remained statistically significant (ps\u2009<\u20090.005) with ratio of sex, mean age, and body parts as covariates. In addition, except for the left supplementary motor area, the findings remained significant when mean age, mean IQ, or age and IQ were included as covariates. \n\n\n### Meta-regression \n  \nAmong the brain regions with significant differences in hyper-\/hypoactivation in ASD shown in the adolescent and adult subgroups, statistically significant correlations (ps\u2009<\u20090.0005) were found between age and activation in the right cerebellum crus I and the left inferior temporal gyrus within ASD individuals (Fig.  ). Specifically, meta-regression of eight studies reflected that the activation of the right cerebellum crus I increased with increasing age. In contrast, meta-regression of nine studies showed that the activation of the left inferior temporal gyrus decreased with increasing age.\n   \nMeta-regression shows that the activation of two brain regions in ASD individuals were significantly associated with chronological age; as age increases:   a   the right cerebellar crus I was more activated and   b   the left inferior temporal gyrus was less activated. Of note, the significant correlation between increasing age and increasing activation in the right cerebellum crus I was driven by two studies (data represented by the two orange dots lying on the left end of the   x  -axis). The interpretation of this significant correlation should be treated with caution. (Note:   Studies that reported a peak in these two regions were included in the calculation; each of these studies is represented as a dot; larger dots represent larger sample sizes  ) \n  \n\n\n### Risk of publication bias \n  \nFor each individual study, the estimated effect sizes of the peak coordinates showing statistically significant differences between the ASD and TD groups (listed in Table  ) were extracted to generate the funnel plots (Fig.  ). Visual inspection of the funnel plots of some MNS regions (Fig.  a, c, d) did not show obvious publication bias. Conversely, publication bias might be present in the left inferior parietal lobule and right amygdala (Fig.  b, e), evidenced by the presence of relatively symmetrical appearance at the top, with more study data missing from the middle to the bottom of these graphs. Egger\u2019s tests remained non-significant for the right inferior frontal gyrus   pars orbitalis   (  p  \u2009=\u20090.428), left supplementary motor area (  p  \u2009=\u20090.182), and left precentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.551), approached significance for the left inferior parietal lobule (  p  \u2009=\u20090.080), and reached statistical significance for the right amygdala (  p  \u2009=\u20090.024). Collectively speaking, these results indicated that small study effects, which might be due to publication bias, were observed in the left amygdala cluster in the main analysis.\n   \nFunnel plots of the activation effect sizes in various brain regions showing differences between ASD and TD during action observation.

After a comprehensive literature search and the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 action observation studies (with 24 experiments) were included in the meta-analysis. In summary, this coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis indicated three main points. First, the MNS is impaired in ASD during action observation; second, MNS dysfunction in ASD individuals is modulated by social-emotional components of the visual stimuli during action observation. Third, age seems to be an important factor in MNS function in ASD. The following discussion is divided into three parts, with each part discussing the possible implications of the points listed above. \n\n### Abnormal activation within and beyond MNS in ASD \n  \nThere has been a hot debate in the past decade on whether mirror neurons are \u201cbroken\u201d in ASD, leading to the impairment in imitation in this group of individuals. The \u201cbroken mirror neuron theory\u201d for autism asserts that the frontal and parietal brain regions with mirror neurons were found to be abnormally activated in individuals with ASD and given the property of mirror neurons (i.e., discharges during both activation observation and execution) that appears to support imitation, impaired imitation might be associated with the \u201cbroken\u201d frontoparietal mirror neurons [ ,  ]. This meta-analysis indeed demonstrated abnormal MNS activations in individuals with ASD, evident by the hyperactivation of the right inferior frontal gyrus and left supplementary motor area, which supports the \u201cbroken mirror neuron theory\u201d. However, at the same time, abnormal activations were also shown in brain regions beyond MNS, that is the hypoactivation of left precentral gyrus, amygdala, and cerebellum. With the abnormalities shown in both MNS and other brain regions, one of the possible explanations is that the imitation deficits in ASD might not be solely attributable to the \u201cbroken mirror neurons\u201d, but the interaction between MNS and other brain regions. One of the frameworks that studies the interplay between brain regions is neural connectivity [ ]. With regards to ASD, the disrupted connectivity theory posits that abnormal structural\/functional connectivity in the brain might underlie the manifestation of behavioral phenotypes in ASD [ ]. Numerous empirical studies, including those using electrophysiological [ ,  ] and neuroimaging [ ] techniques, have pointed to disrupted neural connectivity in individuals with ASD. In particular, abnormal connectivity was found within the MNS. Regarding the neural connectivity between brain regions with mirror neurons, Rudie et al. [ ] recorded hypoconnectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis and left parietal cortex in individuals with ASD relative to healthy controls. Regarding the connectivity between mirror neuron regions and the supporting MNS regions, it was revealed that the amygdala was hypoconnected with the frontal regions where the MNS is situated [ ]. This evidence collectively implies that atypical connectivity within the MNS contributes to dysfunction, which might be associated with the abnormal MNS activation patterns found in this meta-analysis. \n\n\n### MNS impairment during the observation of stimuli with\/without social-emotional components \n  \nTwo findings in the comparison between ASD and TD individuals, regarding the differences in activation patterns when they observe stimuli with and without social-emotional components, confirm our hypothesis that nature of the stimuli (with\/without social-emotional components) might be one of the modulators of neural activation of the MNS. First, regarding the observation of stimuli without emotions, the MNS in the left hemisphere (i.e., left inferior parietal lobule and left supplementary motor area) were found hyperactivated, while the right middle occipital gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus were found hypoactivated in ASD when compared with TD individuals. Notably, the left-lateralized hyperactivation of MNS shown in our study might be an important finding that enhances our understanding of the MNS deficits in ASD. Given an increase in neural activation measured by fMRI has been found to indicate an increase in mental effort during tasks to maintain behavioral performance [ ], and the left-lateralized abnormalities in structural connectivity found in ASD in a previous study [ ], it might be possible that individuals with ASD require extra mental effort for observation of stimuli without emotions, which could be attributable to the possible MNS deficits specifically in the left hemisphere. In terms of the MNS regions showing significant differences between ASD and TD, our results were largely consistent with that reported by Yang and Hofmann [ ]. However, we also noted some diverging results when compared with their study. Specifically, the hypoactivation in the left cerebellum crus I and right postcentral gyrus were not found in their study, while our results reported highly significant hyperactivation in the left, but not the right, inferior parietal lobule. Given action observation and imitation was shown to engage the MNS as other brain regions in a differential manner [ ], the diverging results could be due to the exclusion of the imitation studies in our meta-analysis. Furthermore, different methods of analysis and threshold levels might as well contribute to the inconsistency of results [ ]. \n\nSecond, regarding the observation of stimuli with emotions, our meta-analytic results indicated that the hyperactivation of the right inferior frontal gyrus in ASD individuals was statistically significant when compared with the TD individuals. Importantly, the hyperactivation of this brain region remained highly significant when mean age, mean IQ, gender, and body parts are included as covariates. Given that the right inferior frontal gyrus was considered one of the core MNS regions [ ,  ], our results might imply that the impaired right frontal MNS could possibly be associated with the dysfunctional social-emotional processing, one of the key characteristics of ASD [ ]. Indeed, among healthy individuals, it has been shown that the right inferior frontal gyrus is one of the possible neural correlates of social-emotional perception [ \u2013 ], in which its connectivity with the limbic system predicts the individual differences in successful emotional regulation [ ]. The brain\u2013behavior relationship between the right inferior frontal gyrus and social-emotional processing in ASD could be further investigated to confirm our speculation. \n\n\n### MNS activation in different age groups \n  \nAnother set of analyses we performed was to investigate the activation patterns of MNS and other brain regions in the adolescent and adult subgroups. In addition, we conducted meta-regression with mean age as the regressor within the ASD group to preliminarily observe the MNS developmental trajectory in this group of individuals. In the adolescent subgroup, bilateral frontoparietal MNS were shown to be hyperactivated in the individuals with ASD; the extent of this hyperactivation was shown to remain only in the frontal MNS regions (i.e., left supplementary motor area and right inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis) in the adult subgroup. One explanation for the difference in the activation patterns of MNS between the adolescent and adult subgroups could be due to the greater variation in the adult subgroup, which in turn may reduce the statistical significance of the observed effects. Notwithstanding this limitation, our results provided preliminary evidence in favor of the age effect on MNS functioning in ASD. Further research is necessary to substantiate the present findings and examine the role that age plays on the MNS functioning in ASD. \n\nIn addition, using the linear meta-regression method, we identified a significant linear decrease in the activation of the left inferior temporal gyrus as age increased in the ASD group. The meta-analytic results also reflected that hyperactivation in the left temporal gyrus was only shown in the adolescent subgroup but not in the adult subgroup. This echoed the results in a previous study, in which the inferior temporal gyrus gray matter volume changed from leftward asymmetry (i.e., thicker gray matter on the left side) toward symmetry in individuals with autism from childhood through adulthood [ ]. Conversely, the right cerebellum appeared to exhibit a linear age-related increase in activation. In the adolescent subgroup, the right cerebellum exhibited hyperactivation, and the degree of hyperactivation was further increased in the adult subgroup. The increase in the intensity of hyperactivation may be a consequence of increased lateralization with age [ ]. Although the two brain areas are not considered to be core MNS regions, our findings seem to suggest that the age-related changes in other brain regions beyond MNS could also influence the activation of MNS. More studies are needed to delineate the reciprocal influences and interplay between the inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, and the MNS over time. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nRegarding literature search, we have attempted to obtain a comprehensive set of relevant fMRI data for meta-analysis by extending our scope of search. Using multiple search engines and manual searches from the reference lists of multiple previous review papers, we found 20 suitable action observation studies that provided us with whole brain analytic data for meta-analysis. Although we found 12 additional studies that could potentially be included in the meta-analysis, these studies either included only the region of interest analyses, or the whole brain analysis data were not available. Hereby, the power of this meta-analysis would have been increased, and a more comprehensive picture regarding MNS functioning in ASD could have been presented if the whole-brain results were available in the additional neuroimaging studies. Additionally, since our meta-analysis only included action observation but not imitation studies, the generalizability of the results to the imitation deficits in ASD might be limited. Nevertheless, findings from previous studies have suggested that action observation is in fact one of the key neural processes supporting imitation [ ,  ]. In support of it, evidence yielded from single-neuron recording in humans has reported a three-way differentiation with MNS. For instance, the MNS contained different subtypes of mirror neurons, including neurons typically discharging both during action observation and execution, neurons that discharge only during action observation, and neurons that discharge only during action execution [ ]. These results are in line with previous meta-analysis showing differential activation patterns related to action observation and imitation within the MNS regions [ ]. Future fMRI meta-analysis that include more imitation studies in ASD with more homogeneous study design would help extend current knowledge of brain networks underlying impaired imitation in ASD. \n\nIn addition, the age of the participants in the included studies ranged from 11.3\u201337 for ASD individuals and 11.5\u201337 for TD individuals. Thus, the age effect on MNS can be examined within this age range only; the difference between the ASD and TD individuals in MNS activation remains unknown for populations beyond this age range. Future fMRI studies related to the MNS that target these age ranges are recommended so that the age effect on the MNS can be examined more holistically. Moreover, the meta-regression we performed using the ES-SDM software was a linear regression, which assumed the variable of interest (i.e., mean age) has a linear relationship with brain activation. However, a previous study has shown that the developmental trajectory of the ASD brain appeared to be u-shaped [ ], suggesting that linear meta-regression method may not be ideal for articulating the association between age and MNS activation; together with the fact that the statistical significances found in the reported brain regions were driven by a limited number of studies, results have to be treated with caution. \n\nHeterogeneity of IQ and gender in our study samples is another limitation as some of the MNS abnormal activations disappeared when IQ and age were included as covariates. Future studies with a more homogeneous sample should be warranted to confirm the observation in our meta-analysis. In addition, the heterogeneity of ASD symptomatology and the overrepresentation of adult age group may limit the generalization of the findings to the entire patient population with ASD. Future studies with a broader age range, and including different levels of functioning, would help to delineate the intricate relationship between IQ, age, and levels of symptom severity in wider patient population with the disorder. Furthermore, it should be noted that our included studies generally had a small sample with a range of 5 to 21 participants per group. Given that studies with small sample sizes tend to overestimate the study effect [ ], it might be possible that the MNS abnormality in ASD might have been overestimated. Thus, the generalization of the findings to individuals with ASD in general may be limited by the relatively small sample size in our meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis aimed to explore the differences in MNS activation patterns between TD and ASD individuals when they observe biological motions with\/without social-emotional components. ES-SDM meta-analytic method was adopted to synthesize the available fMRI data. After a comprehensive literature search, whole-brain analysis data from 20 journal articles with 24 experiments were included in the meta-analysis. In summary, this study indicated that the MNS was hyperactivated in ASD, which might underlie the imitation impairments in these individuals. The abnormal activation patterns were modulated by the nature of stimuli and age, which might explain the previous peculiar results contributing to the unresolved \u201cbroken mirror neuron\u201d debate. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":7523366,"text_md5":"110292b17b5995121601ebf13257376b","field_positions":{"authors":[0,40],"journal":[41,51],"publication_year":[53,57],"title":[68,240],"keywords":[254,328],"abstract":[341,2903],"body":[2912,44832]},"batch":2,"pmid":32993782,"doi":"10.1186\/s13229-020-00374-x","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7523366","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7523366"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7523366\">7523366<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7523366  Differential mirror neuron system (MNS) activation during action observation with and without social-emotional components in autism: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies"}
{"text":"Deng, Yuqin and Wang, Xiaochun and Wang, Yan and Zhou, Chenglin\nBehav Brain Funct, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nNeural correlates of interference resolution in the multi-source interference task: a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies\n\n# Keywords\n\nInterference resolution\nMulti-source interference task\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nMeta-analysis\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nInterference resolution refers to cognitive control processes enabling one to focus on task-related information while filtering out unrelated information. But the exact neural areas, which underlie a specific cognitive task on interference resolution, are still equivocal. The multi-source interference task (MSIT), as a particular cognitive task, is a well-established experimental paradigm used to evaluate interference resolution. Studies combining the MSIT with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the MSIT evokes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and cingulate\u2013frontal\u2013parietal cognitive-attentional networks. However, these brain areas have not been evaluated quantitatively and these findings have not been replicated. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn the current study, we firstly report a voxel-based meta-analysis of functional brain activation associated with the MSIT so as to identify the localization of interference resolution in such a specific cognitive task. Articles on MSIT-related fMRI published between 2003 and July 2017 were eligible. The electronic databases searched included PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. Differential BOLD activation patterns between the incongruent and congruent condition were meta-analyzed in anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping software. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nRobustness meta-analysis indicated that two significant activation clusters were shown to have reliable functional activity in comparisons between incongruent and congruent conditions. The first reliable activation cluster, which included the dACC, medial prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, replicated the previous MSIT-related fMRI study results. Furthermore, we found another reliable activation cluster comprising areas of the right insula, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right lenticular nucleus-putamen, which were not typically discussed in previous MSIT-related fMRI studies. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current meta-analysis study presents the reliable brain activation patterns on MSIT. These findings suggest that the cingulate-frontal-striatum network and right insula may allow control demands to resolve interference on MSIT. These results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying interference resolution. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe interjection of goal-irrelevant information with goal-relevant information is referred to as cognitive interference. For instance, while trying to concentrate on your job, you may have to inhibit the habitual tendency to check your Facebook feed. Successful interference resolution depends on flexible cognitive control that suppresses goal-irrelevant inputs, while selecting and organizing goal-relevant inputs. \n\nThe multi-source interference task (MSIT) is a cognitively demanding well established paradigm for assessment of cognitive interference. In the MSIT, stimuli (e.g., the digits \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, or \u201c3\u201d, or a letter \u201cX\u201d or a digit \u201c0\u201d) are organized into groups of three and participants are required to recognize a unique target among the three items under congruent and incongruent conditions [ ,  ]. The spatial position of the unique target matches its correct button-press response in the   congruent condition   (e.g., \u201c1XX\u201d or \u201c100\u201d, the unique targets were \u201c1\u201d and the button was responded at the 1st position) and is in conflict with its correct button-press response in the   incongruent condition   (e.g., \u201c331\u201d, the unique targets were \u201c1\u201d but the button was responded at the 3nd position). In the MSIT, an interference effect is indexed by the difference in reaction time between incongruent and congruent conditions. \n\nIn an initial pilot imaging study of MSIT performance, Bush et al. reported that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was reliably activated at either the individual- or group-level in the incongruent condition, compared with congruent condition, indicating that the dACC is important for interference processing [ ]. Likewise, imaging studies with both youth and adults have shown increased activation in the dACC during MSIT performance and such dACC activity correlated with interference- and error-processing [ ,  ]. Moreover, studies examining female twins [ ] and subjects diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ ] have provided the evidence indicating that MSIT-related dACC activation may be attributable to genetic factors. Clinical studies have associated dACC dysfunctions with MSIT-related cognitive interference in patients with pediatric obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) [ ], schizophrenia [ ], and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ ,  ], suggesting that dACC abnormalities may contribute to cognitive difficulties. \n\nCingulate-frontal-parietal (CFP) cognitive-attentional networks have also been reported to be widely and significantly activated by MSIT [ ,  ]. In a sample of younger and older adults, interference process on MSIT was associated with activation of the fronto-parietal and basal ganglia networks [ ]. Patients with ADHD have been reported to show dysfunction of CFP cognitive-attention networks and abnormal ACC activity during interference processing [ ,  ]. Also, relative to healthy controls, patients with chronic low back pain have been reported to have decreased MSIT-related activation in structures of the CFP network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dACC, and superior parietal cortex [ ]. Patients with OCD have been reported to exhibit functional abnormalities in the cingulate-frontal circuits, insular cortex and the putamen when performing the MSIT [ \u2013 ]. These findings could help to explain the inhibitory control deficits in OCD. \n\nThe MSIT interference effects on cortical activity in the aforementioned studies were variable, perhaps due to differences in study design and sample characteristics. Hence, a quantitative assessment of brain network activity in MSIT is needed. In the present study, we applied a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the published MSIT-fMRI studies with the aim of clarifying the locations of generators of interference processing during MSIT performance. We used effect-size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) as the meta-analytic toolbox [ \u2013 ]. The ES-SDM is a reliable quantitative voxel-based meta-analytic method, which allow to integrate statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates. The meta-analytic method has to be superior to other coordinate-based meta-analytical methods owing to its ability to enable reconstruction of both positive and negative coordinate in the same map, leading to a signed differential map and keeping a special voxel from wrongly arising to be positive and negative at the same time [ ]. It provides Jackknife sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses to further confirm the replicability of voxel-based meta-analytic findings. In this meta-analysis, we expected to demonstrate replicable brain activation patterns associated with MSIT interference processing within the dACC and in the CFP network. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data sources and study selection \n  \nWe conducted a systematic search of PubMed ( ), Web of Knowledge ( ), and Google Scholar ( ) for MSIT-related fMRI studies from 2003 to July 2017. The search term combinations used were: \u201cmulti-source interference task\u201d and \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d. A total of 603 papers were found and assessed to determine if they met the following criteria: (1) an original article published in a peer-reviewed English-language journal; (2) a study employed MSIT during fMRI with a healthy control group; (3) the BOLD fMRI technique was used; (4) MSIT stimuli were numbers and MSIT trials included both incongruent and congruent conditions, as in Fig.\u00a0 ; (5) the fMRI data were analyzed by contrasting of incongruent versus congruent conditions; (6) a whole-brain, voxel-wise analysis was applied in the fMRI data analysis; and (7) fMRI activation clusters were reported in Talairach or MNI coordinates.   \nIllustration of the stimuli in multiple-source interference task (MSIT). Example congruent (right) and incongruent (left) condition trials. Participants were required to recognize the unique target among three items. In the   congruent condition  , the spatial position of the unique target matches the correct button-press response (e.g., \u201c1XX\u201d or \u201c100\u201d, the unique target \u201c1\u201d and its response button are both in the 1st position). In the   incongruent condition  , the spatial position of the unique target is in conflict with its correct button-press response (e.g., in \u201c331\u201d, the unique target \u201c1\u201d is in the 3rd position while its response button is in the 1st position) \n  \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nDifferential BOLD activation patterns between the incongruent and congruent condition were meta-analyzed in Anisotropic Effect-Size Signed Differential Mapping (ES-SDM) software, version 4.13 ( ). ES-SDM, which is a voxel-based meta-analytic approach, is described in detail in the SDM tutorial and publications ( ) [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe meta-analysis procedure followed three steps. First, the peak coordinates of brain activation differences between incongruent and congruent conditions were retrieved from each study. Peak coordinates were recorded with their   z  -values, where   z   could be a positive   z  -statistic or a negative   z  -statistic. Second, effect-size and effect-size-variance maps were recreated for each study. Anisotropic kernels were used to optimize the accuracy of these maps [ ]. Activation maps, both with contrast of incongruent\u2009>\u2009congruent conditions, and contrast of congruent\u2009>\u2009incongruent conditions were calculated by SDM [ ]. Third, a voxel-wise random-effects meta-analysis that considered sample size, intra-study variance, and inter-study heterogeneity was conducted [ ,  ]. The statistical significance was evaluated with a voxel-level (height) threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.00001 and a cluster-level (extent) threshold of k\u2009=\u2009100 voxels [ ]. \n\n\n#### Complementary analyses \n  \nTo evaluate the robustness and replicability of meta-analytic results, whole-brain-voxel-based Jackknife sensitivity analysis was conducted, wherein the same meta-analysis is repeated nine times, each time with a different single study excluded. The principle of the procedure is that if the previous meta-analytic results remain significant, the results can be considered robust and reliable [ ,  ]. Statistical significance was set based on the same thresholds applied in the voxel-wise meta-analytic results. \n\nEmploying a random effects model with Q statistics, we analyzed heterogeneity to determine whether the observed inter-study variance was larger than that resulting from sampling error alone [ ,  ]. Such analyses can reveal any false-positive brain regions due to significant unexplained between-study variability. The default ES-SDM thresholds were set for the heterogeneous results based on a voxel-level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 and a cluster-level threshold of k\u2009=\u200910 voxels [ ]. \n\nA subgroup analysis of adult samples was conducted to examine if potential confounding effects of age contributed to the heterogeneity of the findings [ ,  ]. To evaluate the replicability of meta-analytic results, the statistical significance of the subgroup analysis was also identified with the same thresholds applied in the voxel-wise meta-analytic results. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of the cohorts of the studies included for meta-analysis \n  \nIn total, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis, of which 12 were excluded for overlapping or duplicating data, leaving eight studies eligible for the final meta-analysis. One of these involved two different healthy sample populations (an adult sample and a youth sample), and the interference effect results of each of the two samples were treated as an independent dataset in the meta-analysis [ ]. Hence, our meta-analysis consisted of \u201cnine\u201d study datasets [ \u2013 ,  ,  \u2013 ]. The detailed demographic and task-related variables of each study are presented in Table\u00a0 .   \nSummary of MSIT-fMRI studies (8 studies, 9 datasets) included in the meta-analysis \n  \n\nThe characteristics of the analyzed MSIT-fMRI studies (nine datasets) are summarized in Table\u00a0 . Altogether, data from a total of 344 subjects (106 females), with a mean age of 29.22\u00a0years. Among them, there were 293 adults (80 females; mean age, 31.97\u00a0years) and 51 youths (26 females; mean age, 13.42\u00a0years). \n\n\n### Changes in regional brain responses to cognitive tasks in MSIT studies, complementary analyses \n  \nVoxel-wise meta-analysis showed that, compared to the congruent condition, the incongruent condition produced significantly increased activity in three clusters, involving the dACC, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), right insula, right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right lenticular nucleus-putamen (PUT), left precentral gyrus, and left IFG (Table\u00a0 , Fig.\u00a0 ). As reported in Table\u00a0 , whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed two significant clusters involving the dACC, MPFC, SMA, right insula, right IFG, right PUT were highly replicable across all nine datasets. Only three datasets had significantly activated clusters in the left precentral gyrus and left IFG in common.   \nThe main difference in activation between the incongruent and congruent conditions during multi-source interference task \n  \n L   left;   R   right;   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute;   SDM   signed differential mapping;   dACC   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex;   MPFC   medial prefrontal cortex;   SMA   supplementary motor area;   IFG   inferior frontal gyrus;   PUT   putamen;   preCG   precentral gyrus \n    \nSignificant functional brain activation for incongruent condition\u2009>\u2009congruent condition determined by meta-analysis. Results with   p  \u2009<\u20090.00001 (cluster size\u2009\u2265\u2009100 voxels) are shown. The color bar indicates the regional value of the signed differential mapping (SDM) statistic.   dACC   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex;   MPFC   medial prefrontal cortex;   SMA   supplementary motor area;   IFG   inferior frontal gyrus;   PUT   putamen;   preCG   precentral gyrus \n  \n\nAs reported in Table\u00a0 , our heterogeneity analysis detected a significant unexplained inter-study variance, focused mainly on the occipital lobe, parietal lobe, and right cerebellum. But the heterogeneity analysis did not reveal brain regions with significant incongruent versus congruent differences in voxel-wise meta-analysis results (Table\u00a0 ). Significant clusters in the dACC, MPFC, SMA, right insula, right IFG, and right PUT, but not in the left precentral gyrus and left IFG, were retained in a subgroup analysis of adult subjects. Hence, significant clusters of activation in the voxel-wise meta-analysis results involving the dACC, MPFC, SMA, right insula, right IFG, and right PUT were reliable and robust.   \nHeterogeneity analysis results \n  \n L   left;   R   right;   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute;   SDM   signed differential mapping \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a voxel-based meta-analysis that identified MSIT-associated functional brain activation. Robustness analyses confirmed that the significance of two major activation clusters involving the dACC, MPFC, SMA, right insula, right IFG, and right PUT was reliable and robust during comparison between incongruent and congruent conditions. \n\nOur findings are consistent with previous fMRI studies on MSIT indicating robust activation in the dACC, MPFC and SMA during interference processing when incongruent and congruent conditions are compared [ ,  ,  ]. In the MSIT, subjects need to respond to the target while ignoring simultaneously presented unrelated information. Conflict is generated when the task-irrelevant information is incompatible with the target, thereby impeding the processing of task-relevant information. The dACC is recruited to monitor conflict. Higher dACC activity for incongruent trials has also been found in the flanker task [ ,  ], Stroop task [ ,  ], and Simon task [ ,  ], providing further evidence for the supposition that the ACC is involved in detecting conflict in various interference tasks. Electrophysiological studies in both humans and monkeys have shown that dACC neurons firing rates increase during conflict processes and this increase is thought to promote ongoing behavioral adjustment [ \u2013 ]. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, which posits that increased ACC activity occurs when a high level of conflict is detected in incongruent trials, thereby recruiting top-down cognitive modulation to resolve the conflict and improve performance [ ]. On the other hand, most imaging studies examining MSIT performance have found higher SMA activity in incongruent trials than in congruent ones and our meta-analysis results confirmed this conclusion. Anatomically, the SMA has ventral connections with the dACC [ ]. Anatomically, the SMA has ventral connections with the dACC [ ]. Thus, the SMA and dACC might work together to solve the interference challenge in the MSIT. Functionally, the SMA participates in movement planning and in action initiation and inhibition [ \u2013 ]. In other conflict tasks, researchers have also found that the SMA played a leading role in guiding the process of action-monitoring [ ]. In a recent review of neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and stimulation studies of the SMA, Coull et al. proposed that the SMA may be involved in the cognitive development of a sensory representation of time, in addition to its aforementioned roles [ ]. Altogether, the SMA is implicated in the process of deciding when to initiate an action or not. This possibility is supported by a prior electrophysiological study showing that neuronal activity in the SMA is associated with proactive and reactive behavioral control in a stop-signal task [ ]. The SMA plays a proactive role in controlling arm movements to regulate motor readiness, and is involved in inhibiting arm movements in response to an unexpected stop signal. Accordingly, in the MSIT, after conflict is detected by the dACC, the SMA might be activated to plan movements and to establish flexible adaptive behavior. \n\nAn unexpected finding in our meta-analysis was a significantly active cluster involving the right IFG, right insula, and right PUT in comparisons between incongruent and congruent conditions. But previous studies employing the MSIT have found that CFP cognitive-attentional networks are reliably activated under these conditions. Although the result was not predicted, it is in agreement with a previously proposed role of the right IFG [ ]. In a systematic review of a decade of literature regarding right IFG functions, Aron et al. found that the right IFG, together with one or more fronto-basal-ganglia network regions (including the PUT), may play a critical role in outright action-stopping in response to external stop or salient signals or internal goals [ ]. The authors of other reviews of empirical electrophysiological and neuroimaging data from various inhibition paradigms (e.g., Stroop, Simon, and flanker tasks) have proposed that right IFG\/basal ganglia pathways may contribute to goal-directed and habitual inhibition [ \u2013 ]. However, Bari and Robbins, who contributed a systematic summary of inhibition and impulsivity studies, suggested that the right IFG appears to be involved not only in the processing of response inhibition but also in the updating of goal-related plans of action [ ]. According to these reviews, incongruent MIST trials produce more interference and inhibitory control than congruent trials due to the need to suppress distracting stimuli. Thus, interference may be resolved by engagement of the right IFG and PUT. \n\nThe insula is a commonly activated region in the go\/no-go task, flanker task, and stimulus\u2013response compatibility task, and insula activation has been shown to be related to interference resolution in each task [ ]. Cai et al. examined causal interactions within core frontal-cingulate-parietal regions in the stop-signal task and the flanker task [ ]. The strength of causal interaction between the right anterior insula and dACC was found to be greater under high cognitive control conditions than under low ones, and to be significantly associated with cognitive control ability indices in both the stop-signal task and the flanker task, suggesting that both the right anterior insula and dACC may be involved in cognitive control in various interference tasks. On the other hand, the insula and dACC are constituents of \u201csalient network\u201d, in which the right insula is thought to detect salient stimuli for recruitment of inhibitory control [ \u2013 ]. The salient feature is considered as a stimulus that is highlighted. The incongruent condition of MSIT, in which the target response is inconsistent with the target locations, has higher interference and stand out from the congruent one. Accordingly, in MSIT, the activation in right insula may involve in detecting interference and recruiting the interference-resolution. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, our findings extend the results of prior MSIT studies, confirming that the dACC and prefrontal cortex are the main brain areas activated by MSIT performance. Our meta-analysis confirms cogently, for the first time, two robust activation clusters encompassing the dACC, MPFC, SMA, right IFG, right PUT, and right insula during MSIT performance. Compared to the congruent condition in the MSIT, the incongruent condition is characterized by more conflict and a greater need for cognitive control. On the basis of the functions of the aforementioned brain regions, we postulate that the right insula may send saliently relevant (high interference) signals to the dACC to be used to induce conflict monitoring, and to the SMA, right IFG, and PUT to be used for movement planning and inhibitory control, enabling goal-related flexible, adaptive behavior to be established. Hence, our findings indicate that a cingulate-frontal-striatum network and the right insula may serve as a critical brain circuit in interference resolution. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":5891971,"text_md5":"246e9d68c258d9bcca15d8faeb2db0c6","field_positions":{"authors":[0,63],"journal":[64,81],"publication_year":[83,87],"title":[98,232],"keywords":[246,353],"abstract":[366,2696],"body":[2705,22676]},"batch":2,"pmid":29636070,"doi":"10.1186\/s12993-018-0140-0","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5891971","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5891971"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5891971\">5891971<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5891971  Neural correlates of interference resolution in the multi-source interference task: a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies"}

Chronic pain is often associated with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD); both have been linked to adverse childhood experiences. It is unclear how the effect of adverse childhood experiences on neural processing impacts on vulnerability to chronic pain, MDD, or both, and whether there are shared mechanisms. We aimed to assess evidence for central neural changes associated with adverse childhood experiences in subjects with chronic pain, MDD, or both using systematic review and meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nElectronic databases were systematically searched for neuroimaging studies of adverse childhood experiences, with chronic pain, MDD, or both. Two independent reviewers screened title, abstracts, and full text, and assessed quality. After extraction of neuroimaging data, activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis was performed to identify significant brain regions associated with these comorbidities. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nForty-nine of 2414 studies were eligible, of which 43 investigated adverse childhood experiences and MDD and six investigated adverse childhood experiences and chronic pain. None investigated adverse childhood experiences, chronic pain, and MDD together. Functional and structural brain abnormalities were identified in the superior frontal, lingual gyrus, hippocampus, insula, putamen, superior temporal, inferior temporal gyrus, and anterior cerebellum in patients with MDD exposed to adverse childhood experiences. In addition, brain function abnormalities were identified for patients with MDD or chronic pain and exposure to adverse childhood experiences in the cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus in task-based functional MRI studies. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe found that adverse childhood experiences exposure can result in different functional and structural brain alterations in adults with MDD or chronic pain compared with those without adverse childhood experiences. \n\n\n## Systematic review protocol \n  \nPROSPERO CRD42021233989. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n   Editor's key points   \n  \nThe association between adverse childhood experiences and chronic pain or depression has been well established, but the neural substrates are poorly understood. \n  \nThis systematic review with meta-analysis of the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences on chronic pain and depression identifies limited literature examining the neural correlates of chronic pain and adverse childhood experiences, with no studies of adverse childhood experiences and comorbid chronic pain and depression. \n  \nThe authors highlight the need for further research to improve understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying chronic pain, adverse childhood experiences, and depression. \n  \n \n\nChronic pain is defined as pain that lasts longer than 3 months, or pain that persists beyond normal healing time.  The prevalence of chronic pain in the UK is 35\u201353% of the population, increasing with older age, and often associated with comorbid conditions such as depression. ,  ,  ,   A recent systematic review found that over half of patients with fibromyalgia had co-existing major depressive disorder (MDD), ,  ,   although the nature of the link between pain and depression is not clear.  At a global level, chronic pain conditions are the leading cause of years lived with disability,  and, independent of pain, MDD has a prevalence of approximately 10%. ,  ,  \n\nAdverse childhood experiences (adverse childhood experiences) are defined as repeated aversive experiences that represent a deviation from the expected environment and require adaptation.  Examples include physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, parental illness, criminality, violence, neglect, and poverty. ,  ,  ,  ,   Chronic pain has been found to be related to adverse childhood experiences ; for example exposure to adverse childhood experiences may be a risk factor for fibromyalgia in later life.  As with chronic pain, adverse childhood experiences have been proposed as a risk factor for developing mood disorders later in life.  Adverse childhood experiences are associated with elevated risk for multimorbidity with both mental and physical health problems. Although reasons for this are poorly understood, long-term immune system and neurobiological changes may play a role in altering vulnerability to chronic pain and MDD in adult life. \n\nThe quality of parental care, nutrition, cognitive stimulation, and socioeconomic status during early child development have been shown to affect brain morphology and functionality throughout the life course.  Neuroimaging is an important tool in advancing understanding of the neural correlates of chronic pain  and depression, and allows exploration of the impact of adverse childhood experiences, with the potential to identify common mechanisms. ,  ,   There have been some neuroimaging studies of chronic pain and adverse childhood experiences identifying involvement of various brain regions, such as the insular cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampal cortex, and prefrontal cortex ; however these studies had not examined the comorbidity of adverse childhood experiences and chronic pain. Adverse childhood experiences and MDD neuroimaging studies share several common features, with reported abnormalities of the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior insular, and superior temporal gyrus, ,  ,   but these studies had revealed the abnormalities without the comorbidity of adverse childhood experiences and MDD. A notable brain region strongly implicated as affected by adverse childhood experiences and depression in neuroimaging studies is the hippocampus; specifically, there is robust evidence for a smaller hippocampal volume. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   There is limited understanding of how comorbid chronic pain and MDD are affected by adverse childhood experiences. \n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to synthesise evidence from relevant neuroimaging studies to investigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the neural correlates of chronic pain, and depression, both alone and in combination. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature \n  \nAfter prospective registration on PROSPERO ( ; Registration number: CRD42021233989), a systematic literature search, data extraction, and meta-analysis were carried out. The search was conducted using the following electronic databases, MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), PsycINFO (OVID), PubMed, Neurosynth, Sleuth, and Web of Science. An advanced search strategy was developed using a list of MeSH and keywords in combination or alone, such as chronic pain, neuropathic pain, MDD, depression, anxiety, neuroimaging, MRI, and early life adversity. Searches were customised for each database. The searches were restricted to English language, whereas no publication status, or date restrictions were imposed on the systematic search. Searches were imported into Rayyan for removal of duplicates, screening, and study selection ( ). \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nEligible studies were on humans, were randomised or non-randomised, or observational (cross-sectional or longitudinal, cohort). To be eligible for review, studies had to include participants with chronic pain, depression with a history of adverse childhood experiences, or both, and have quantitative data and neuroimaging measures (i.e. structural and functional MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Participants\/study population of selected papers were adults aged 16 yr or older. Chronic pain was defined as pain that had been present for at least 3 months, and adverse childhood experiences were defined as repeated aversive experiences that represent a deviation from the expected environment and require adaptation and had been identified by a questionnaire such as the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).  Standard depression rating scales ,  ,   were converted to a summary measure using a recognised conversion table in order to allow comparisons.  Studies were excluded if patients had acute pain, there was no diagnosis of depression, or depression severity was mild. Studies involving participants with brain injury, brain tumours, stroke, or neurodegenerative conditions were also excluded. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nTo investigate the associations between chronic pain, mood disorder, and the effects of adverse childhood experiences on brain structure and function, neuroimaging studies identified through systematic searching were assessed for inclusion by two independent reviewers (GA, EL). Firstly, title and abstract screening was carried out, assessing against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Secondly, where it was not possible to determine eligibility from the title and abstract, full-text screening was performed. When discrepancies were raised, they were resolved through discussion, or, when they remained, by consultation with a third party (DS, LC). Cohen's kappa  was computed to assess the agreement between two reviewers \u2018include\u2019, \u2018maybe include\u2019, or \u2018exclude\u2019 decisions during the full-text screening. \n\nWhen the selection process was completed, data were extracted according to our predefined protocol. Data extracted from each study included publication details (e.g. authors, year of publication, country where the study was carried out) and demographic characteristics of the sample such as age and sex. Moreover, the clinical diagnosis was extracted for MDD and chronic pain along with type and scale of measurements for adverse childhood experiences, MDD, and chronic pain. The neuroimaging method used was also extracted along with the modality, the patient groups, use of contrast (if task-related functional MRI [fMRI]) and the resulting significant coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates of the brain regions). \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThere is no standardised tool for assessing the risk of bias in MRI (structural and functional), to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we modified a version of the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa scale,  which is used for assessing the quality of non-randomised studies, including case-control and cohort studies, in meta-analyses. The risk of bias tool included four categories, study selection aspects (adequate case definition: MDD, chronic pain, and adverse childhood experiences, representative of the cases, selection of controls and definition of controls), comparability (age, sex, and other variables), exposure (ascertain of exposure and drop-out rate), and statistical interference (uncorrected   P  -value threshold and correction for multiple testing at each voxel). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis method \n  \nA coordinate-based meta-analysis approach, activation likelihood estimate (ALE), of extracted neuroimaging results ,  ,   was used to analyse studies within BrainMap GingerALE 3.0.2 ( ). Talairach space coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates using the \u2018icbm2tal\u2019 transform.  To take into account the spatial statistical uncertainty of the reported foci in the ALE method, foci were modelled as a 3D Gaussian probability distribution.  Considering between-subject and between-template variance for each study, the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian probability was computed.  FWHM of the modelled probability was computed through combining the activation probabilities of the reported foci, for each analysed study.  By combining the activation probabilities of the reported foci, modelled activation maps were computed for each analysed study. The union of these modelled activation maps as ALE scores were calculated within a grey matter on a voxel-by-voxel basis. ALE scores are tested against a null distribution of random spatial events to test for statistical significance. \n\nCluster-level family-wise error (I) has greater sensitivity and specificity and is less prone to type one error with regard to the convergence in comparison with voxel-wise thresholding. In particular, the foci convergence is achieved over the random clustering of the foci-noise via testing against the null hypothesis of random spatial association between experiments.  Thus, the I was used to guide the meta-analysis. Statistical significance was set at a corrected threshold of   P  <0.05 (using a threshold derived from the permutation of 1000 cluster-forming events assuming a voxel level of   P  <0.05). Computations involving the same group of subjects were pooled into one experiment to control for sample overlap.  A random-effects analysis was used (GingerALE 3.0.2) with incorporation of variable uncertainty based on subject size,  where the subject size is determined as the smallest number of participants in the contrast of the groups.  We performed a meta-analysis across all fMRI and voxel-based morphology paradigms contrasting participants who experienced adverse childhood experiences with participants who did not experience adverse childhood experiences. In addition, where there was a sufficient number of relevant studies, we aimed to perform separate exploratory meta-analyses on MDD (or chronic pain) participants with adverse childhood experiences, MDD participants without adverse childhood experiences, separately for fMRI and VBM and fMRI MDD with adverse childhood experiences compared with healthy controls. An assessment of heterogeneity is frequently used in non-neuroimaging studies; however, there is not yet any accepted method to calculate this for coordinate-based meta-analyses. Therefore, we were unable to assess this formally. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAfter removing duplicates, 228 studies on mood disorder and adverse childhood experiences and 15 studies on chronic pain and adverse childhood experiences were identified, from title and abstract screening. After title, abstract, and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 full-text screening, 43 studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria for mood disorders and adverse childhood experiences, with six studies for chronic pain and adverse childhood experiences. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   No studies were identified of adverse childhood experiences with comorbid mood disorder and chronic pain. Cohen's kappa was computed with good agreement between the two reviewers: kappa=0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57\u20130.82;   P  <0.0001) for full-text study selection. Of the 108 full-text studies screened, 43 met inclusion criteria: 26 were structural MRI studies, seven were resting-state fMRI studies, and 10 were task-based fMRI studies (Supplementary material). Most of these studies were cohort studies or case-control studies. Details of the included structural studies can be found in  , and task-based fMRI studies can be found in  . Summary tables of imaging findings for the structural and task-based fMRI can be found in  ,  , respectively.   summarises identified resting state fMRI studies: it was not possible to carry out ALE meta-analysis because of inadequately reported coordinates in those studies. The risk of bias is summarised in the Supplementary material. The assessment of study quality showed no study at high risk, nine studies at an intermediate risk of bias, and 40 studies at low risk of bias.   \nSummary table of the main result for the structural MRI studies. adverse childhood experiences, adverse childhood experiences; BDI-II, Beck's Depression Inventory; CECA, Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse; CM, childhood maltreatment; CN, childhood neglect; CTQ, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; CTQ-SF Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form; EA, emotional abuse; ELA, early life adversity; GMV, grey matter volume; HAD, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HAMD, Hamilton depression scale; HAMD-D, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; HDRS, Hamilton Depression Rating; HC, healthy control; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IDS-SR, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self report; LS, life stress; MADRS, Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale; MDD, major depressive disorder; PHQ, Patient Health Questionnaire; QIDS, Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology; SA, sexual abuse; SDS, Self-rating Depression Scale; ROD, recent onset of depression; SPD, somatoform pain disorder. \n  Table\u00a01     \nSummary table of the main result for the functional MRI studies. adverse childhood experiences, adverse childhood experiences; BDI-II, Beck's Depression Inventory; CECA, Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse; CM, childhood maltreatment; CTQ, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; CTQ-SF, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form; EA, emotional abuse; ELA, early life adversity; ELT, early life trauma; GMV, grey matter volume; HAD, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HAMD, Hamilton depression scale; HAMD-D, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; HC, healthy control; HDRS, Hamilton Depression Rating; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IDS-SR, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self report; IP, internalizing psychopathology; MADRS, Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale; MDD, major depressive disorder; MSPD, multisomatoform pain disorder; PA, physical abuse; PHQ, Patient Health Questionnaire; QIDS, Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology; SA, sexual abuse; SDS, Self-rating Depression Scale; SPD, somatoform pain disorder. \u2217Structural MRI provides detailed images of the brain's anatomy, whereas task-based functional MRI provides information about brain activity and function during a specific task. \n  Table\u00a02     \nSummary table of patient characteristics, and main result for resting state MRI studies. adverse childhood experiences, adverse childhood experiences; BDI-II, Beck's Depression Inventory; CECA, Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse; CM, childhood maltreatment; CN, childhood neglect; chronic pain, chronic pain; CTQ, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; CTQ-SF, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form; EA, emotional abuse; EAL, early adverse life; ELA, early life adversity; ELS, early life stress; GMV, grey matter volume; GUPI, Genitourinary Pain Index; HAD, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HAMD, Hamilton Depression Scale; HAMD-D, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; HC, healthy control; HDRS, Hamilton Depression Rating; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; IDS-SR, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self report; MADRS, Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale; MDD, major depressive disorder; PHQ, Patient Health Questionnaire; QIDS, Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology; RSN, Resting State Network; SA, sexual abuse; SDS, Self-rating Depression Scale; SPD, somatoform pain disorder; UCPPS, urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome. \n  Table\u00a03   \n\nStructural MRI experiments, voxel-based morphology were split based upon disease status:   \nMDD participants exposed to adverse childhood experiences were compared with MDD participants not exposed to adverse childhood experiences (five experiments; 13 foci; 277 participants), which revealed eight significant clusters in the anterior, occipital, temporal, frontal lobe, and putamen and insula (further details in  ).   \nThree groups of fMRI experiments and two groups of voxel based morphology significant meta-analysis results using GingerALE.

Using a systematic review and meta-analysis, we have explored adverse childhood experiences as a potential modulator for chronic pain and depression in adulthood. Significant structural alterations for patients with depression and adverse childhood experiences in the hippocampus, insula, and putamen were identified, with functional alteration in the precuneus. Investigation of the effects of adverse childhood experiences on chronic pain or depression revealed significant functional changes in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus\u00a0( ). We have shown that adverse childhood experiences have been linked with alterations in the function of the brain in people with chronic pain. Epigenetic and epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between adverse childhood experiences and chronic pain in later life ,  ,  ,  ,  ; however, we have identified a gap in the neuroimaging literature studying the long-term impact of adverse childhood experiences on neural processing in people with chronic pain. There are neuroimaging studies examining psychosocial adversities (e.g. physical, sexual, emotional abuse), but there are no studies examining non-psychosocial adversities such as those arising from serious medical conditions (e.g. asthma, cancer, epilepsy in early life) which have often been overlooked.   \nKey brain regions that are commonly associated with pain perception, including the insula, anterior and posterior cingulate, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and thalamus. \n  Fig 1   \n\nThe reward-motivation network (including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and ventral tegmentum) and the descending pain modulatory system (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], amygdala, hypothalamus) are implicated in vulnerability to painful conditions with evidence for structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in the brain ( ).  Other areas that might not affect risk of developing chronic pain, but are relevant to pain perception include changes in the insula, thalamus, orbitofrontal, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, and dorsal ACC extending to mid-ACC.  There is also an extensive literature around the involvement of the reward-motivation and salience networks in people with MDD.  The neural correlates of emotional processing have been well studied in people who have experienced adverse childhood experiences, although reward processing has received less attention, but there is evidence that suggests a deficit in reward sensitivity.   \nListing specific brain areas and their possible relation to pain, chronic pain, MDD and adverse childhood experiences. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; adverse childhood experiences, adverse childhood experiences; MDD, major depressive disorder; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex. \n  Table\u00a05   \n\nOur findings have demonstrated an impact of adverse childhood experiences on neuroanatomically plausible areas associated with mood and pain processing. Major cortical projections from the spinothalamic tracts (associated with pain) include the posterior insula, parietal operculum, and mid-cingulate cortex.  Posterior insula and parietal operculum stimulation and focal seizures can trigger pain, lesions can cause pain deficits, and cortical insula damage has been correlated with neuropathic pain.  Other regions, including anterior insula and anterior cingulate, influence the experience of pain but are also activated by other aversive experiences generating negative affect and anxiety. ,  ,   Lesions in the posterior insula  and mid-cingulate cortex  can result in patients continuing to recognise pain but with reduced or absent suffering; pain asymbolia.  The anterior insula is thought to alter responsiveness to specific stimuli  because of its involvement in the salience network,  which mediates changes in the default mode network and frontoparietal network facilitating responses to salient stimuli.  Notably, a systematic review on childhood adversity and neural development highlighted the importance of the salience network,  with increased insula activation in children exposed to violence. ,  ,  ,  ,  \n\nA meta-analysis of functional imaging studies reported that activation of the PCC was associated with the experience of pain and episodic memory retrieval  consistent with earlier reports. ,  ,   The anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) is also strongly associated with the experience of pain,  and for some patients, small lesions of the aMCC relieve the distress of intractable pain.  Relative to the aMCC though, a larger and more posterior part of the cingulate is also associated with pain.  Furthermore, there is evidence for a rostral\u2013caudal segregation of function, with the anterior PCC region more associated with pain and the posterior PCC region more associated with memory.  PCC activation appears consistently associated with the emotional salience of stimuli and, despite evidence for segregation, there is a tendency for emotion and memory-related activations to overlap.  Our meta-analysis study is consistent with these reports, such that patients with chronic pain and MDD were found to have reproducibly abnormal PCC activity. Furthermore, it is worth noting that healthy subjects with a history of adverse childhood experiences also have abnormal PCC activation. Consequently, abnormal activation of this region may be associated more with emotion and memory-related activations of the PCC rather than experiences of pain. \n\nThe hippocampus has an important role in the storage and retrieval of long-term explicit memories  and in associative learning.  It also has an important role in terminating the stress response via its regulatory role in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis.  Hippocampal volume and functional abnormalities have been reported inconsistently in deprivation-exposed children.  Nevertheless, in children exposed to threat-related adversity, reduced hippocampal volumes have been reported, consistent with our findings including reduced activation during a memory task.  Reduced hippocampal volume has been reported in patients with chronic pain: fibromyalgia,  complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and chronic back pain (CBP),  with evidence for learning and memory deficits in patients with chronic pain.  Chronic pain and depression comorbidity is common, and it has been suggested that hippocampal abnormalities observed in patients with chronic pain may be related to the mood component.  Anhedonia, chronic pain, and depression have all been correlated with blunted striatum activation which may be related to dopaminergic abnormalities modulated by hippocampal afferents.  Studies on animals and humans have revealed reduced neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurotropic factors and increased hippocampal inflammation in both patients with depression and chronic pain. \n\nThe reward system includes the caudate and putamen,  with these regions responding to both the receipt and anticipation of reward.  Consistent with anhedonia being a prominent clinical feature of depression, the brain reward circuitry appears abnormal in depression with functional dysregulations and brain structure changes,  in accordance with our findings, such as blunted striatal responses to anticipated reward in maltreated children.  Blunted reward-linked striatal activity has also been observed in patients with adverse postnatal experiences.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia during reward anticipation in humans exposed to childhood adversity may reflect abnormalities in dopaminergic circuits reported in animal studies. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nPotential limitations of this study should be noted. First, an assessment of heterogeneity is often done in non-neuroimaging studies, but there is no methodology for assessing heterogeneity for ALE or other coordinate-based meta-analyses.  The ALE method provides an estimation of the probability that an activity in a specific region may differ between groups of patients and not an estimate of the mean difference in the regional signal change.  Thus, traditional measures of heterogeneity are not applicable.  Second, the limited number of neuroimaging studies available in the literature investigating chronic pain with adverse childhood experiences limited the meta-analysis results. Third, adverse childhood experiences have been associated with other psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, whereas our study focused only on patients with depression. Recall bias,  unfortunately, cannot be eliminated because of the systematic error that occurs when the participants did not remember previous adverse childhood experiences accurately when answering the questionnaire. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies and pre-existing datasets that include information collected during childhood, which can be further linked to healthcare records in later life (e.g. Generation Scotland: STRADL-Pain, ,  ,   ALSPAC ), are approaches to address this limitation. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThis review has investigated the neural correlates of adverse childhood experiences on chronic pain and depression. It is notable that there are few neuroimaging investigations into patients with chronic pain who have experienced adverse childhood experiences. Nevertheless, significant brain structure and function correlations with adverse childhood experiences were observed in people with major depressive disorder or chronic pain in comparison with healthy controls. In the former, correlations were found in the hippocampus, superior insula, putamen, and precuneus, and in the latter, significant correlations were found in the dorsal anterior cingulate and precuneus. Our results indicate the existence of brain structural and functional abnormalities associated with adverse childhood experiences \u2013 some of which may be characteristic for adverse childhood experiences and others more related to comorbid depression and chronic pain. Moreover, they are suggesting a shared neural correlates for comorbidity and possibly increasing the vulnerability to develop later in life depression, chronic pain, or both. \n\n\n\n## Authors\u2019 contributions \n  \nConcept: GA, EL, LC, JDS \n\nStudy design: GA, EL, LC, JDS \n\nInterpretation of data: GA, EL, LC, JDS \n\nDrafting the manuscript: GA, EL, LC, JDS \n\nArticle screening and selection: GA, EL \n\nData extraction, analysis, and quality assessment of studies: GA \n\nRead and approved the final version of the manuscript: all authors \n\n\n## Acknowledgements \n  \nWe are grateful to Research Librarian, Scott McGregor at Library and Learning and Culture and Information, University of Dundee for his kind assistance with design of the database searches.

The aim of our meta-analysis was to identify concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. \n\n Methods:   A systematic search was conducted to identify voxel-based rs-fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. The permutation of subject images seed-based   d   mapping (SDM) was used to quantitatively estimate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. Metaregression was conducted to examine the associations between clinical characteristics and functional alterations. \n\n Results:   A total of 16 studies with 19 datasets including 434 patients with T2DM and 391 healthy controls were included. Patients with T2DM showed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. Metaregression analysis identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM. \n\n Conclusion:   The patterns of regional spontaneous neural activity alterations, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum, might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, leading to long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications of various organ systems, including multiple central nervous system deficits, which are often associated with dementia, cognitive deterioration, and emotional dysfunctions (Kodl and Seaquist,  ; Moheet et al.,  ; Thakur et al.,  ). Growing evidence does show that the cognitive decrements in T2DM patients appear to be attributable to brain structural and functional alterations (van Harten et al.,  ; Moran et al.,  ). \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool to study the brain mechanism underlying the cognitive dysfunction of diabetes with quantitative measures. In recent decades, there is a growing interest of the use of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study the neurophysiological mechanism of T2DM because of its non-invasive and task-free nature. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)\/fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are two methods commonly used for characterizing local spontaneous neural activity of rs-fMRI data (Zuo and Xing,  ). The ALFF in the blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent signal has been correlated with local field potential activity (Logothetis et al.,  ), and the fALFF is strongly coupled with ALFF and quantifies the amplitude of these low-frequency oscillations (Zou et al.,  ). The ReHo is thought to reflect the similarity or synchronization between the time series of a given voxel and its nearest neighbors (Zang et al.,  ). In rs-fMRI studies, ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo are usually used in \u201cwhole-brain voxel-wise\u201d analysis with very similar preprocessing parameters across studies. Synthetically, the ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo provide complementary information about the regional spontaneous brain activity (Xu et al.,  ). \n\nUsing the ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo, regional spontaneous neural activity deficits in T2DM have been widely reported. However, they have produced inconsistent results. For example, increased regional activity has been found in the lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and precuneus (Wang et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liu Y. et al.,  ), whereas decreased activity in these regions has also been reported (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang Y. F. et al.,  ), and yet more studies have identified no changes (Liu et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Liu D. et al.,  ). This inconsistency resulted in part from small samples and from studying patients with various comorbidities, such as microangiopathy, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ); vitreous hemorrhage (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ); mild cognitive impairment (Zhou et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ); cirrhosis (Wang Y. F. et al.,  ); hypertension (Cui et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ); and dyslipidemia (Wang et al.,  ), which were known to alter brain function (Weissenborn et al.,  ; Umegaki et al.,  ; Umemura et al.,  ; Friedman et al.,  ; Muela et al.,  ). Thus, the central question of how the brain regional function manifests remains unaddressed in T2DM. \n\nAs a complex statistical method, meta-analysis involves the synthesis of data from relevant studies to identify an effect or draw a conclusion, and this approach can justify and refine hypotheses for various diseases (Mak et al.,  ). Comparing to the image-based meta-analysis, which requires the full image information, the peak probability meta-analysis methods such as seed-based   d   mapping (SDM, formerly Signed Differential Mapping) and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) are more feasible owing to they only using the peak coordinates. SDM adopted various positive features from previous methods such as ALE and multilevel kernel density analysis (MDKA), and introduced a series of improvements and novel features (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). For example, SDM represents both positive and negative differences in the same map, thereby preventing a particular voxel from appearing to be significant in opposite directions (Radua et al.,  ). Another relevant feature is the use of effect sizes, which allows combination of reported peak coordinates with statistical parametric maps, thus allowing more exhaustive and accurate meta-analysis (Radua et al.,  ). Additionally, SDM enables several complementary analyses, such as subgroup and metaregression analyses, that can be used to assess the robustness and heterogeneity of the results (Radua et al.,  ). A previous meta-analysis in T2DM using ALE reported widespread brain function alterations including reduced activity in the lingual, postcentral, inferior temporal, cerebellar, insular, and posterior cingulate cortices as well as increased activity in the precuneus and superior frontal gyrus (Xia et al.,  ). However, this study involved functional connectivity measurements in addition to regional activity, and also included perfusion modality using arterial spin labeling (ASL). \n\nTherefore, using a permutation of subject images seed-based   d   mapping (PSI-SDM) as primary tool, the aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative, voxel-based meta-analysis of whole-brain rs-fMRI studies in T2DM to investigate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities and explore the potential effects of the clinical and demographic characteristics on these functional alterations. Although both ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo measured the local activity of each voxel, previous studies found that ALFF and ReHo revealed convergent local activity alterations in some brain regions and also divergent brain regions with abnormal activity (Cui et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). Hence, both combined and separate meta-analyses on ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo were performed in this study. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Selection of Studies \n  \nA systematic search was conducted for relevant studies in the PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE databases before December 31, 2020, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). The key search words were (\u201cdiabetes\u201d or \u201cdiabetic\u201d), (\u201camplitude of low-frequency fluctuation\u201d or \u201cALFF\u201d or \u201cfALFF\u201d or \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d or \u201cReHo\u201d), and (\u201cmagnetic resonance\u201d or \u201cMRI\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d). Besides, manual searches were conducted among the reference sections of the retrieved studies and suitable reviews. Studies were considered to be eligible according to the following criteria: (1) comparison of patients with T2DM with healthy controls; (2) using voxel-based analysis to investigate ALFF, fALFF, or ReHo changes in the entire brain or entire gray matter; (3) reporting of whole-brain results in a stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach); (4) published in English as an article. The corresponding authors were asked via email to send any additional data that were not included in the original publications. To minimize data entry error, all data from the initially retrieved studies were extracted by two radiologists. For each included study, we recorded the following: sample size, gender, age, education, illness duration, onset age, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A  (HbA )%, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, scanner, acquisition parameters for rs-fMRI, software packages, and analytic methods. \n\n\n### Voxel-Based Meta-Analysis \n  \nVoxel-based meta-analyses of regional brain differences were conducted with PSI-SDM software package ( , version 6.21). The procedures included the data preparation, preprocessing, mean analysis, and statistic test in brief. \n\nIn the data preparation, the peak coordinates and   t   values were written in a text file for each study. The studies with non\u2013statistically significant unreported effects (NSUEs) were also included, and their text files were recorded with no content and named with the extension of \u201c.no_peaks.txt\u201d In the preprocessing, PSI-SDM first estimated the lower and upper bounds of possible effect-size images for the contrast between patients and controls from peak coordinates and effect sizes for each study separately. Second, PSI-SDM performed the meta-analysis of NSUE (MetaNSUE) based on maximum likelihood estimation and multiple imputation algorithm, which could include studies with NSUEs and was substantially less biased than previous versions of SDM. Briefly, PSI-SDM used the MetaNSUE to estimate the most likely effect size and its standard error and to create several imputations based on adding noise to these estimations within the bounds for each study (with or without NSUEs). Default number of imputations in PSI-SDM was used in this study (  n   = 50) (Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  , ). In the mean analysis, PSI-SDM conducted a random-effects meta-analysis for each imputed dataset and then used Rubin's rules to combine the coefficients and their covariance and the heterogeneity statistics   I   and   Q   of these imputed datasets (Li et al.,  ; Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). In the statistical test, subject images were recreated in order to run a standard permutation test, in which the process was repeated with each set of permuted images. Statistical significance was determined by the maximum statistic from the images derived from the permuted images (voxel   p   < 0.005, peak height   z   = 1, cluster extent = 10 voxels) (Radua et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Subgroup Analysis \n  \nTo both establish consistency of findings and to identify measurements associated with divergent finding, we further performed secondary subgroup analyses to characterize brain regional function abnormalities within studies using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo separately. \n\n\n### Metaregression Analysis \n  \nThe potential effects of relevant demographic and clinical variables were examined by a random-effects general linear metaregression. The independent variables explored by the metaregression were mean age, percentage of males, education, illness duration, onset age, HbA %, BMI, and MMSE scores in patients with T2DM. The dependent variable was the SDM-  Z   value. The metaregression analyses were performed for studies using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo separately as well as their combinations. As reported in a previous study, we decreased the probability threshold to 0.0005 to reduce spurious results (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). In the findings of whole-brain metaregression analysis, the regions that did not overlap with those in the main between-group analysis were discarded. Finally, regression plots were visually inspected to discard fittings driven by few studies (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ; Radua et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and Publication Bias Analyses \n  \nThe between-studies heterogeneity of individual clusters was tested using a random-effects model. Magnitude of heterogeneity was estimated using   I   index, computed as 100% \u00d7 (  Q   \u2013   df  )\/  Q  , where   df   is the degree of freedom, which estimates the proportion of variability due to non-random differences between studies. Funnel plots of significant clusters were also created by Egger tests (Egger et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nA total of 47 articles were identified through the systematic literature search, and   shows the details of study selection process. We finally included 16 studies (19 T2DM datasets and 15 healthy controls datasets) in the final meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ; Wang Y. F. et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Liu D. et al.,  ; Liu Y. et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). In two studies of ReHo, the analysis was performed in two different T2DM subgroups (Peng et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ), and in another study, the analysis was performed with ALFF and ReHo (Cui et al.,  ). Besides, two studies used the same sample but analyzed two different measurements (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). For these studies involving multiple independent patient subgroups or different measurements, the group coordinates were treated as separate datasets in the meta-analysis. \n  \nLiterature search and study selection flowchart.

However, there were two outliers at the longest illness duration in the regression plot ( ). When excluding the two datasets (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ), no significant association was found between the illness duration and regional activity in patients with T2DM. The mean age, percentage of males, education, onset age, HbA %, BMI, and MMSE scores were not linearly associated with regional function alteration in patients with T2DM. \n  \nMetaregression analysis results.

The Egger test of funnel plot asymmetry did not identify any publication bias in any cluster (all   p   > 0.05). Detailed results of heterogeneity and publication bias analyses are provided in the  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present meta-analysis identified regional spontaneous neural activity alterations in patients with T2DM, including hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, and hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. The novel findings of this study were hypoactivity in the medial superior frontal gyrus and hyperactivity in the cerebellum, which were inconsistent to previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). \n\nThe medial frontal cortex is a key part of the default mode network (DMN) and has been mainly implicated in value-based decision-making, regulation of negative emotion, self-perception, and social cognitive function (Bechara et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Roy et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Hiser and Koenigs,  ). The dysfunction of DMN was associated with the deficits in neurocognitive performance and episodic memory in patients with T2DM (Cui et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). We also identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM. This finding was consistent with previous studies that reported association between diabetic duration and structural and functional abnormalities in the medial pre-frontal cortex, such as gray matter atrophy (Garcia-Casares et al.,  ), white matter deficits (Hsu et al.,  ), decreased glucose metabolism (Garcia-Casares et al.,  ), and reduced functional connectivity (Liu et al.,  ). Besides, the hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex was found to correlate with diabetic microvascular disease (Wang et al.,  ), which was consistent with the observation of reduced cerebral blood flow in this region (Dai et al.,  ; Bangen et al.,  ). These findings suggested the functional alterations in the medial pre-frontal cortex might be the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive deficits associated with cerebral small vessel disease in T2DM (Nelson et al.,  ; Umemura et al.,  ) and exacerbated with the progression of disease course (Korf et al.,  ). However, it should be noted that the correlation between regional function in the medial pre-frontal cortex and diabetic duration in our metaregression was not significant when excluding two outliers at long illness duration. As diabetic duration was found to be associated with the risk of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (Chen et al.,  ) and stroke (Banerjee et al.,  ), the longer disease duration might lead to the increased mortality (Maser et al.,  ; Pop-Busui et al.,  ). Thus, the potential survival bias might account for the lack of long diabetic duration sample. The robustness of association between regional function in the medial pre-frontal cortex and illness duration in T2DM needs to be further identified. \n\nThe cerebellum controls motor coordination and execution. Previous laboratory studies found the association between motor deficits and the cerebellar damage in diabetic rats (Sherin et al.,  ; Nagayach et al.,  ). The cerebellum dysfunctions also related to impaired cognition in patients with T2DM as structural and functional connectivity alterations were found in the cerebellar and cerebrocerebellar circuits (Fang et al.,  ; Zhang D. et al.,  ). The hyperactivity in the cerebellum might be a recruitment of additional neural resources to compensate for loss of cognitive function in the cerebral regions (Xia et al.,  ). \n\nThe regional hypoactivity in the left lingual gyrus extending to calcarine fissure\/surrounding cortex and right superior temporal gyrus extending to insula was consistent with a previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). The lingual and calcarine surrounding gyri are key components of the visual cortex. Visuospatial dysfunction was common in T2DM (Moran et al.,  ), and the hypoactivity in the lingual gyrus was also correlated with impaired cognitive performance (Cui et al.,  ). The superior temporal gyrus is linked to language processing, which may be impaired by dysglycemia (Allen et al.,  ). The insula is an integral region in the salience network (Menon and Uddin,  ), and hypoactivity may cause deficits in generation of appropriate behavioral responses to stimuli in patients with T2DM. \n\nThe present study showed some inconsistencies with previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). Our meta-analysis revealed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus and hyperactivity in the right hemispheric cerebellum, whereas previous meta-analysis revealed hyperactivity in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and hypoactivity in the right cerebellar culmen. There were several possible reasons accounting for the discrepancy. First, the former meta-analysis included only five original studies and seven datasets that investigated the regional functional activity alterations using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo. Our study with a larger sample included 16 original studies and 19 datasets, and many of the newly included studies reported hypoactivity in the medial superior frontal gyrus (Liu et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ) and hyperactivity in the cerebellum (Liao et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). Second, the previous meta-analysis included both regional activity and functional connectivity measurements as well as perfusion modality, whereas this meta-analysis enrolled only studies using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo indices reflecting the regional spontaneous neural activity, avoiding heterogeneity of the included studies (Xia et al.,  ). Third, we performed this meta-analysis using a newly developed tool with nearly unbiased algorithm to estimate effect size (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral limitations should also be noted. First, as many original studies included patients with comorbidity, the effect of comorbidity on the regional functional activity alterations could not be assessed. Second, the combined analysis of ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo datasets and subgroup analysis of ALFF\/fALFF or ReHo datasets showed functional activity alterations in divergent regions. Thus, the different measurements might contribute to the heterogeneity of regional spontaneous neural dysfunction. Third, we detected relationship between functional activity alteration and diabetic duration; however, all the included studies were cross-sectional. Besides, this relationship was not significant when excluding two outliers at long illness duration. Thus, the metaregression result should be considered cautiously and further identified. \n\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis identified concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum. These findings might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJL and PZ conceived and designed the study.

In particular, their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry, for instance, as diagnostic tests\/tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, given their complexity and potential clinical implications, there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence for the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe following databases were searched on November 28, 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), PsycINFO, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library. Studies that used a machine learning algorithm partially or fully for distinguishing individuals with ASD from control subjects and provided accuracy measures were included in our analysis. The bivariate random effects model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was used to investigate and resolve the source of heterogeneity between studies. True-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values from individual studies were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity values, draw Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and obtain the area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 43 studies were included for the final analysis, of which a meta-analysis was performed on 40 studies (53 samples with 12,128 participants). A structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) subgroup meta-analysis (12 samples with 1776 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.90\/0.83. A functional magnetic resonance imaging\/deep neural network subgroup meta-analysis (5 samples with 1345 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.71\/0.67. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of ASD was considered acceptable by few accuracy measures only in cases of sMRI use; however, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning algorithms to clinical settings. \n\n\n## Trial Registration \n  \nPROSPERO CRD42018117779; https:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/prospero\/display_record.php?RecordID=117779 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Background \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), behaviorally characterized by a deficit in social communication and rigidity in interest or behavior by both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11), is believed to be a product of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors [ - ]. The latest prevalence of ASD has been reported to be 1 in 59 children aged 8 years, based on the 2014 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data [ ], and 1 in 40 children aged 3-17 years, based on parental reports of the diagnosis in a national survey [ ]. Despite the advancement of many biomarkers with potential in prediction or early detection of ASD (eg, structural magnetic resonance imaging [sMRI] or functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]), a diagnosis is not made until the age of 4-5 years, on average [ , ]. \n\nMachine learning has been increasingly studied as a novel tool to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and early detection of ASD [ ]. Unlike traditional rule-based algorithms that allowed computers to generate answers with preprogramed rules, machine learning allows building of an algorithm that can learn, predict, and improve with experience, based on big data [ , - ]. Psychiatric decision making is more sophisticated and difficult to characterize, compared with machine learning, although there are some common elements. Psychiatrists diagnose patients by observing their behaviors and registering all collected and collateral data into their (psychiatrists\u2019) cognitive system as sensory input values (eg, voice and vision). Similarly, machine learning requires a series of steps, including preprocessing (eg, noise removal from data before input into an algorithm), segmentation, and feature extraction [ ]. In particular, machine learning in the field of ASD diagnostics incorporates big data (eg, neuroimaging), making the input data immense and complex [ ]. The application of machine learning algorithms in the field of neuroimaging often requires an extra process, such as   feature selection   that extracts key features from a complex dataset. In other words, key features are selected before the learning process, which is called   feature selection   [ ]. \n\n\n### Objective \n  \nCurrently, machine learning is widely applied to the field of bioinformatics, including genetics and imaging, and many applications require signal recognition and processing [ ]. Machine learning algorithms are currently applied to the field of psychiatry in areas such as genomics, electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuroimaging. However, owing to the complex workflows implicated in machine learning itself, the accuracy of such algorithms is varied [ ]. This study aimed to suggest an integrated estimate of the accuracy for use of machine learning algorithms in distinguishing individuals with ASD from control groups through systematic review and meta-analysis of the available studies. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. The study protocol was written before initiation of the study and registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (trial registration: CRD42018117779). \n\n\n### Data Sources and Search Strategy \n  \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), and PsycINFO were selected as core search databases, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library was added to maximize the sensitivity of the search. The IEEE Xplore Digital Library is a database created by the IEEE, the largest of its kind worldwide, and includes more than 1800 peer-reviewed conference proceedings. Default search filters provided by journals were not used. There was no restriction by publication type (eg, conference proceedings) or language. The initial search was conducted on November 28, 2018. The search strategy and query per search database are listed in  . The primary consideration for study inclusion was if machine learning was partially or fully applied in distinguishing individuals clinically diagnosed with ASD from controls and assess the accuracy of such applications.   lists inclusion\/exclusion criteria. An author (SM) retrieved the initial search results and removed duplicates by using the command   find duplicate   via a reference software (Endnote X9, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, another author (JK) manually searched for and removed any residual duplicates. Finally, the studies were screened independently by two authors (SM and JK) by title, abstract, and keywords, after which the full texts of the selected studies were screened by two authors (SM and JK) by inclusion\/exclusion criteria. If any discrepancy was found in the final selection, the two authors reached a consensus via discussion. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nA data extraction form was created through discussion among the authors before the extraction process to suggest specific subgroups and coding processes (categorizing) for a meta-analysis ( ). The process is provided in detail in  . General characteristics such as author, publication year, sample size, average age, gender ratio, and data characteristics were extracted from individual studies. Information regarding the reference standard used in individual studies and definitions of positive\/negative disease (autism positive\/control) and methodologies to distinguish individuals with autism from control group were collected. Specific methodologies used to process and classify data for use in machine learning algorithms were also recorded (  and  ). All accuracy values were extracted, and true-positive \/ true-negative \/ false-positive \/ false-negative (TP\/TN\/FP\/FN) values were calculated from individual studies for a meta-analysis. If the TP\/TN\/FP\/FN values could not be calculated from the accuracy values provided in a study, an email was sent to the corresponding author to request raw data. If there was no response within 14 days, the study was not included in the meta-analysis. The extraction was performed independently by two authors (SM and JK). If there was any discrepancy in the extracted data, a consensus was reached by thorough discussion after repeating the same extraction process. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo authors (SM and JK) independently assessed the quality of individual studies based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). QUADAS-2 is a validated tool used to evaluate the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies by patient selection, index test, reference standard, and risk of bias (RoB) for internal validity and external validity for applicability concerns of individual studies [ ]. There was no disagreement between authors in the assessment of patient selection and reference standard domain. The index test, also known as the target tool of our investigation in this study, is a machine learning algorithm. The target tool, the machine learning algorithm\u2019s accuracy, is reported through a process called validation. However, when a study provided no information about the validation process, low RoB was assumed if independent datasets were used for training, building a model, and validation [ ]. Otherwise, the level of RoB was determined by thoroughly reviewing the validation processes. \n\n\n### Evidence Synthesis \n  \nIn our meta-analysis, a bivariate random effects model was used to consider both within- and between-subject variability and threshold effect [ ]. A Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics (SROC) curve was generated based on parameter estimates extracted from the bivariate random effects model [ ]. The SROC curve was specified by pooled sensitivity, specificity point, 95% CIs, and prediction region. Area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC) were calculated based on the SROC curve [ ]. Studies that were visually deviant from the 95% prediction region on the SROC curve were considered heterogeneous [ ]. Attempts were made to resolve the heterogeneity by performing a subgroup analysis\u2014generating individual SROC curves for subgroups (minimum 5 studies) [ ]. If most studies were within the 95% prediction region on the SROC curves of the subgroups, the sample was determined to be homogeneous, and integrated sensitivity, specificity, and SROC curve results were provided. If any of the TP\/FP\/TN\/FN value was 0, 0.5 was added to prevent zero cell count problem [ ]. The TP\/FP\/TN\/FN values were extracted or calculated from each independent sample in a study, and if multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to the same sample, an algorithm with the best accuracy (calculated as [TP+TN]\/[TP+FP+TN+FN]) was selected for data extraction. \n\nA meta-analysis was conducted via the mada package in R (version 3.4.3, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), and statistical significance was expressed with 95% CIs. Publication bias was not assessed in our analysis, as there are currently no statistically adequate models in the field of meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search, Selection, and General Characteristics \n  \nAfter duplicate removal, of the 280 studies extracted from five databases and one additional database, 43 studies were selected, of which 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis.   provides details according to the screening stage. \n\nThe publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018 for the final selection of 43 studies, of which 40 were journal articles and 3 were gray literature elements (eg, conference proceedings). A total of 10 studies used a public database that was available on the internet and open to anyone, 18 used a private sector database (eg, clinic and hospital), 3 used both public and private databases, and the remaining 12 used databases from others. Regarding the average age of the sample, 5 studies included adults, 22 studies included school-aged participants, 11 included preschool-aged participants, and the remaining 5 did not provide any information. For the machine learning algorithm, 20 studies used a support vector machine (SVM), 3 used a deep neural network (DNN), 13 used others, and the remaining 10 used and compared multiple algorithms. For prediction, 11 studies used sMRI features, 9 used fMRI features, 9 used behavior traits, 5 used biochemical features, 4 used EEG features, and the remaining 2 used text or voice features. For reference standards, 24 studies used DSM-IV, DSM-IV - Text Revision, or DSM-5; 10 used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); 2 used ICD; and the remaining 7 did not provide relevant information. For the validation methodology, 37 studies only used internal validation, 2 only used external validation, and 4 used both. The abovementioned information is summarized in  , and the extracted raw data are presented in   and  . \n  \nFlowchart for the literature screening and selection process. \n    \nCharacteristics of 43 studies for the systematic review and 53 samples for the meta-analysis. \n    \n\n### Qualitative Assessment \n  \nOf the 43 studies in total, more than half were assessed to have an unclear RoB by patient selection domain (33 studies) and index test domain (29 studies). More than half were considered to have a low RoB by the total reference standard (35 studies) and flow and timing domains (35 studies). For applicability concern, about half (22 studies) were shown to have unclear or high-risk RoB by patient selection domain, whereas most were considered to have a low risk by index test (42 studies) and reference standard domain (36 studies). Qualitative assessment for all the individual studies is summarized in  , and the distribution is shown in  . \n  \nRisk of bias and applicability concern by domain in Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Microsoft Excel was used. \n  \n\n### Quantitative Analysis (Meta-Analysis) \n  \nOf the final selection of 43 studies, only 40, from which TP\/FP\/FN\/TN values were extractable, were considered for the meta-analysis. A total of 53 independent samples were extracted from the 40 studies and included in the meta-analysis ( ). Of the 53 samples, 12,128 participants were inspected in the meta-analysis, with the total sensitivity and specificity ranging from 0.55 to 1.00 and 0.56 to 0.99, respectively. TP\/FP\/FN\/TN, sensitivity, and specificity values for 53 individual samples are summarized in  , and visual distribution is provided as SROC in  . Of the 53 samples, 12 were found outside the 95% predictive region of the SROC curve, and therefore, there was heterogeneity between samples ( ). \n\nIn an attempt to resolve this heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis was conducted with 19 variables that had been predefined and coded. For replicability, a raw data sheet listing the precodified variables is available in  . As a result, among 19 variables,   predictor   was the only one by which the heterogeneity could be partially resolved. Of the 53 samples, for the sMRI subgroup that used sMRI as predictors, all the 12 samples were found to be within the predictive region of the SROC curve, thus resolving the heterogeneity ( ). \n\nFor the sMRI subgroup, the pooled sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC\/pAUC was 0.90\/0.83. Meta-analysis was also attempted for the remaining subgroups, such as fMRI (15 samples), behavior traits (14 samples), and biochemical features (7 samples) subgroups, but the pooled sensitivity and specificity could not be provided owing to a significant degree of heterogeneity between samples: A few samples were shown to be far off the predictive region of the SROC curves ( - ). However, sub-subgroup meta-analysis using 5 samples that used fMRI as a predictor and DNN as a classifier allowed for the heterogeneity to be resolved and provided the pooled sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.71\/0.67 ( ). \n\nSimilarly, another sub-subgroup meta-analysis of six samples that used sMRI as a predictor and SVM as a classifier resolved the heterogeneity and resulted in a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.93), specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.71-0.95), and AUC\/pAUC of 0.92\/0.88 ( ). Sensitivity and specificity values and types of classifiers used for samples of individual subgroups that used neuroimaging features (sMRI and fMRI subgroups) as predictors are provided in  , and a forest plot is provided in  . \n\nSummary Receiver Operating Characteristics curve for functional magnetic resonance imaging\/deep neural network sub-subgroup (5 samples).

SROC: Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics. \n\nThe sensitivity and specificity for the behavior traits (14 samples) subgroup ranged from 0.68 to 1.00 and 0.56 to 0.9, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the biochemical features (7 samples) subgroup ranged from 0.77 to 0.94 and 0.72 to 0.93, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the EEG subgroup (3 samples) ranged from 0.94 to 0.97 and 0.81 to 0.94, respectively. The results are summarized in  . Information for other measures not included in the meta-analysis is provided in  . \n  \nSummary Receiver Operating Characteristics curve for all 53 samples.

On the basis of the opinion that the AUC\/pAUC value is considered acceptable when above 0.7, both the AUC\/pAUC values can be thought to be acceptable for the sMRI subgroup [ ]. However, given the wide confidence interval for each summary sensitivity and specificity, the clinical usefulness of those values can be difficult to determine. In addition, precaution is warranted for interpreting the accuracy results, as the 95% predictive region is larger than the 95% CI region on the SROC curve, indicating a high degree of uncertainty for the pooled sensitivity and specificity calculated [ ]. In addition, only one sample from the sMRI subgroup utilized an external validation method, where demographic characteristics of the training dataset were independent of those of the validation dataset. In other words, the rest of the samples in the sMRI subgroup built their validation datasets from participants who were similar to or the same as those recruited in the training datasets. Hence, those samples are believed to have high risks of overfitting, compromising the generalizability of machine learning models and overestimating the results of the meta-analysis of the sMRI subgroup [ ]. \n\nMachine learning algorithms can be divided into supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning by learning pattern [ ]. SVM, for which subgroup analysis was performed for sMRI, is the oldest method of supervised learning, whereas DNN, for which subgroup analysis was conducted for fMRI, is the most advanced of the neural network methods (supervised learning), modeled after the mechanism of neurons [ ]. On the contrary, the accuracy values for the fMRI subgroup using one of the latest machine learning algorithms, DNN, were found to be lower than those for the sMRI subgroup. This may, in part, be attributable to possible overestimation secondary to the overfitting in the sMRI subgroup. In addition, one of the studies in the fMRI\/DNN sub-subgroup composed their dataset by recruiting over 1000 participants from various sites to minimize limitations such as overfitting in their analysis. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. Of the final selection of 43 studies, 33 did not provide clear information regarding the process of obtaining an original database or a recruiting training\/validation dataset from the real clinical world, or raw data such as basic demographic characteristics of the participants before the input process, thus increasing the RoB in the patient selection processes. For example, more than half the finally selected studies did not match the samples for age or gender, and the number of images or signals per participant was not specified in most of the neuroimaging and EEG studies. Subgroups other than the sMRI subgroup included studies that used the same database, thus raising concerns for possible sample overlap, which was challenging to process statistically owing to the lack or absence of information on the patient selection process. If datasets overlapped and lowered the accuracy, the subgroup meta-analysis would have been underestimated and vice versa. In addition, behavior, EEG, and voice\/text subgroups did not consist of enough studies to attempt to resolve the heterogeneity and provide pooled accuracy values. Furthermore, owing to the heterogeneity, summary accuracy values could not be obtained for adult (aged over 18 years), school-age (between 6 and 18 years), and preschool-age (less than 6 years) subgroups, thus limiting the ability to draw a conclusion on accuracy by age groups. Corresponding authors for individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were reached out to, and one responded. Even if more had responded, to our knowledge, there would not have been any way to perform the aggregation. \n\n\n### Comparison With Prior Work \n  \nTo our knowledge, there is currently no study that has performed a systematic review and\/or a meta-analysis on diagnostic test accuracy for the use of machine learning in diagnosing ASD and suggested its pooled estimate accuracies. In this analysis, many individual studies reported small TP and high TP (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) and caused significant heterogeneity for a meta-analysis (see  ). Authors resolved the heterogeneity by using subgroup analyses. As a result, individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were barely included in fMRI and sMRI subgroup analyses, thereby resolving the heterogeneity and allowing conduct of the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, recommendations from our results may improve the quality of prospective studies using machine learning algorithms in ASD diagnosis. First, Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) can guide machine learning diagnostic studies to enhance the reporting of patient selection processes. In addition, there is the comprehensive guideline for algorithm developers in terms of choosing an adequate predictive model for a target sample; setting the parameters, definition, or threshold; and minimizing errors such as overfitting and perfect separation [ ]. Use of the STARD and other guidelines [ ] would facilitate more transparent and comprehensive work in this space. Although not discussed in the studies included in our analysis, decision or running time for a machine learning algorithm in ASD diagnosis could become an important quality measure in the near future when these algorithms might be employed in a busy daily clinical practice. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of diagnosing ASD by machine learning algorithms was found to be acceptable by select accuracy measures only in studies that utilized sMRI. However, because of the high heterogeneity in the analyzed studies, it is impossible to draw a conclusion on any subgroups that used behavior traits or biochemical markers as predictors. There is a clear need for new studies with more comprehensive reporting of the selection process and dataset to draw a more accurate conclusion. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6942187,"text_md5":"fda99d2765b2abdb90ee68cf5070b1ac","field_positions":{"authors":[0,84],"journal":[85,101],"publication_year":[103,107],"title":[118,284],"keywords":[298,400],"abstract":[413,3040],"body":[3049,25999]},"batch":2,"pmid":31562756,"doi":"10.2196\/14108","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6942187","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6942187"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6942187\">6942187<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6942187  Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies"}

Compared to the spontaneous brain activity of HCs, we found changes in spontaneous brain activity in Dn-FES based on these two methods, mainly including the frontal lobe, putamen, lateral globus pallidus, insula, cerebellum, and posterior cingulate cortex.\n \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \n We found that widespread abnormalities of spontaneous brain activity occur in the early stages of the onset of schizophrenia and may provide a reference for the early intervention of schizophrenia. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with multiple symptoms and dysfunctions [ ]. Epidemiological surveys have shown that the global prevalence of schizophrenia is about 1% and causes huge economic losses and tremendous pressure on families and society [ , ]. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have suggested that functional abnormalities may contribute to the development and progression of schizophrenia. \n\nrs-fMRI is a magnetic resonance technique that reflects the functional activity of a specific brain region through changes in the magnetic resonance signal produced by altered blood oxygen levels, and it is commonly used to study local brain functional changes using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) [ - ]. These two methods have satisfactory stability and can be easily duplicated and does not need a priori hypothesis. ALFF uses the power of low-frequency signals to determine strong and weak neuronal activity in different brain regions, and is often used to measure blood oxygen level dependent signals in the frequency range of 0.01\u20130.1 Hz [ ], while fALFF is a standardized ALFF method that can effectively suppress the effects of noise and has higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous neural activity signals [ ]. ReHo reflects the synchronization degree of neuronal activity in local brain area indirectly by calculating the consistency of time series between each voxel and adjacent voxels [ , ]. Therefore, the above methods have their own advantages in studying the functional changes of schizophrenia. They are commonly used to identify the local neural activity abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and are considered to be a reliable imaging marker, but the results may be influenced by medication and duration of illness, thus leading to inconsistent results [ , - ]. For instance, current cross-sectional studies found increased ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo in putamen in first-episode schizophrenia [ , ], while others failed to replicate the above results in chronic patients [ , ]. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, a simultaneous meta-analysis of the two measures of spontaneous brain activity based on resting-state fMRI has not been performed. Gong et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis to compare the differences in ALFF between first-episode schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia. Xu et al. [ ] included six studies on ALFF\/fALFF and used the ALE method to compare the differences brain activity between schizophrenia patients and the control group. Additionally, Qiu et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis comparing differences in ReHo among all schizophrenia patient groups, chronic schizophrenia groups, and healthy controls (HCs). However, studies have not fully elucidated the abnormalities in spontaneous brain activity in patients with drug-na\u00efve firstepisode schizophrenia (Dn-FES) using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo, which might be due to the unavailability of data. \n\nAnatomical\/activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a highly reliable coordinate-based meta-analysis method, which was developed by Turkeltaub et al. [ ]. A random-effects model is constructed to fit each activation point into a probability distribution to obtain the ALE map [ ]. Previous studies mostly focused on a single resting-state function index, and no researcher used the ALE software to study the specific changes in the brain function in patients with schizophrenia [ ]. Therefore, it is crucial to use the ALE meta-analysis method to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies at rest using ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo to find specific markers in patients with Dn-FES. \n\nTo address the abovementioned issues, in this study, we used the accurate ALE algorithm to evaluate the two indices (ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo) and determine specific alterations in Dn-FES. We hypothesized that both ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo would elucidate abnormal changes in brain function. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature selection \n  \nThe meta-analysis of the studies that performed resting-state function imaging was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement and recorded using the suggested checklist. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nWe obtained the studies published between the date of the first available date and January 2022 through a systematic and comprehensive search in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases. The retrieval strategy involved selecting studies with 1) \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d [Mesh] and (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation [Title\/Abstract] or ALFF [Title\/Abstract] or fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation [Title\/Abstract] or fALFF [Title\/Abstract]) and (\u201cresting state\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d); 2) \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d [Mesh] and (ReHo [Title\/Abstract]) or Regional homogeneity [Title\/Abstract]) and (resting-state [Title\/Abstract] or functional magnetic resonance imaging [Title\/Abstract]) or (fMRI [Title\/Abstract]) (  in the online-only Data Supplement). \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, the inclusion criteria were listed as below: patients diagnosed with schizophrenia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders international standardized diagnostic criteria, who had first psychotic episode and not administered antipsychotic medication; studies that focused on rs-fMRI, with ALFF\/fALFF or ReHo application; studies that were peer-reviewed original studies published in English language journals; studies that compared the two resting-state function indices between the Dn-FES group and the HC group. \n\nIn this meta-analysis, the exclusion criteria were listed as below: studies without the full text or those that did not improve the coordinates of the human brain and studies that were unavailable even after communicating with the author over the telephone or mail; studies involving subjects with psychiatric disorders besides schizophrenia (comorbidity); studies that were not based on ALFF\/fALFF or ReHo. \n\n\n### Data extraction and quality assessment \n  \nLiterature search, screening, and data extraction were conducted by two psychiatrists (X.L.Q. and R.R.Z.) who had received consistent training. Any differences in opinions and doubts were resolved by two senior psychiatrists (L.W. and H.J.M). Data were extracted for the name of the author, sample size, sex, age, course of the disease, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score, full width at half maximum, and coordinate. The ten-point checklist was used to assess the quality of each study [ ]. \n\n\n### Data analysis procedures \n  \nThe ALE software ( ) [ ] was used to perform a meta-analysis of the differences in ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo between Dn-FES and HCs. According to the findings of the two different approaches (ALFF\/fALFF, ReHo), we divide them into four groups: increased ALFF\/fALFF group (number of foci=37, n=715), decreased ALFF\/fALFF group (number of foci=29, n=630), decreased ReHo group (number of foci=11, n=166), and increased ReHo group (number of foci=17, n=272). First, we put the extracted peak coordinate information in independent text, imported it into the ALE software, and transformed Talairach coordinates into Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates. Then, we performed the false discovery rate multiple comparison correction, with the p-value set to 0.05, [ ] and the ALE brain map was visualized using the BrainNet software ( ) running in the Dpabi environment. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Search results and sample features \n  \nA total of 549 studies were searched in three databases (PubMed, n=98; Embase, n=164; Web of Science, n=287). After deleting duplicate studies and screening titles and abstracts, we found 39 potentially eligible studies for inclusion. Then, after a detailed review of the full texts, 18 datasets of rs-fMRI studies, 1,039 Dn-FES patients, and 1,425 HCs were included in our meta-analysis [ , , , , - ]. The sample characteristics and imaging information of the included studies are shown in   and  . \n\n\n### The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation\/fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation specific brain alterations in drug-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia \n  \nWe found higher ALFF\/fALFF in the bilateral putamen and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right cerebellum, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of Dn-FES patients compared to that of the HCs ( ,  ). Significant abnormal reduction in the brain areas was not found in Dn-FES. \n\n\n### Regional homogeneity specific brain alterations in drug-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia \n  \nWe found higher ReHo in the left putamen, MFG, insula, and right lateral globus pallidus ( ,  ), and lower ReHo in the right paracentral lobule and bilateral precentral gyrus (PreCG) in Dn-FES patients compared to those of the HCs ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis was the first systematic meta-analysis investigating rsfMRI-specific alterations in ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo in patients with Dn-FES. We found that both ALFF\/fALFF and ReHo values were altered in Dn-FES. In Dn-FES, higher ALFF\/fALFF values were mainly in the putamen, MFG, PCC, SFG, and cerebellum; however, no brain region with lower ALFF\/fALFF was identified. Moreover, our study showed higher ReHo in the putamen, MFG, insula, and lateral globus pallidus, and lower ReHo in the right paracentral lobule and Pre-CG in Dn-FES. These results provided new insights into the neurophysiological mechanism of Dn-FES. \n\nWe found higher ALFF\/fALFF in the bilateral putamen and higher ReHo in the left putamen and right lateral globus pallidus. The putamen and lateral globus pallidus are important components of the striatum. Several studies have demonstrated abnormalities in the striatum in schizophrenia [ , , ]. If destroyed, it may lead to dopamine release disorder in the striatum, resulting in mental symptoms. Sui et al. [ ] found higher fALFF in the striatum and thalamus of patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, higher spontaneous neural activity in the striatum was significantly associated with positive symptoms. The dysfunction of the striatum may be the basis of schizophrenia. Moreover, a longitudinal study showed higher fALFF and ReHo in the putamen before treatment; after eight weeks of treatment, fALFF and ReHo in the putamen increased further [ ]. These results suggested that the striatum might be a relatively stable imaging biomarker for schizophrenia, independent of the duration of illness and medication. \n\nThe default mode network (DMN) is a set of key brain regions, including the PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, and other important nodes [ ]. It plays a significant role in stimulating independent thoughts and monitoring the external environment [ ]. Abnormal alterations in the spontaneous brain activity of the DMN occur in schizophrenia [ ]. By performing resting-state fMRI, a study found that the DMN connectivity increased in patients with schizophrenia; thus, these findings are in accordance with findings reported by our meta-analysis [ ]. A recent systematic literature review of rs-fMRI showed a decrease in the DMN activity in the schizophrenia group compared to that of the HC group [ ]. Another study found mixed results regarding the changes in the DMN of schizophrenia patients [ ]. The differences in the results of the above studies may be due to the influence of confounding factors such as duration of the disease course, administration of antipsychotics, or sample size. Therefore, including data of more patients and using specific neuroimaging markers associated with the DMN are essential for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. \n\nIn our meta-analysis, we also found an increase in ALFF\/fALFF in the left SFG and right MFG, an increase in ReHo in the left MFG, and a decrease in ReHo in the bilateral PreCG and the right paracentral lobule. These regions are components of the frontal lobe. Some researchers found that the frontal lobe, which is the most commonly affected region in schizophrenia, is the hub of high-level intellectual activities involving cognition, clinical syndrome and thought disorder [ , ]. By performing functional MRI, a study showed that the spontaneous neural activity of the frontal cortex was increased in people with chronic schizophrenia [ ]. In the aspect of Dn-FES, another study showed increased regional functional abnormalities in the frontal lobe [ ]. Thus, abnormal spontaneous activity in the frontal lobe may be a reliable biomarker for schizophrenia, and the simultaneous increase and decrease in the spontaneous activity in the frontal lobe may be a compensatory mechanism in the early stages of psychiatric illness. Based on the nature of the study, the results need to be interpreted carefully. \n\nWe also found an increase in ReHo in the left insula of patients with Dn-FES. The insula is one of the major nodes of the Salience Network, which helps in adjusting the DMN and the central execution network [ ]. These internal networks influence each other and play a common role in various activities [ ]. Abnormal functions in one of the resting networks in patients with schizophrenia may result in misprojection of internal and external information, presenting symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and cognitive disorder [ , ]. By performing rs-fMRI, a study showed that functional activity of insula in schizophrenia group was abnormal compared with HCs group, consistent with our findings [ ]. These results suggested that abnormalities in the insula might be the basis of schizophrenia. Other abnormal brain regions, such as the cerebellum, also play a major role in patients with schizophrenia [ ]. Typical features of cerebellar impairment include deficits in working memory, emotion regulation, verbal and visuospatial learning. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough we found promising results, some limitations of this study need to be mentioned. First, although we tried to maintain homogeneity of the sample, it was not always possible to do so because the software could not account for the influence of the PANSS score, head motion and the duration of the disease on the results. Another limitation, publication bias must be mentioned, negative results cannot be published, and the quality of research can lead to it [ ]. Because ALE software is only suitable for the research that reported the peak coordinates, we cannot include the studies that did not report any cluster, but we conduct a perfect retrieval strategy to find out all the published literature, strictly evaluate the quality of all the included original research, and exclude low-quality research, so as to minimize the publication bias. Nevertheless, we need to interpret the results carefully. Moreover, this meta-analysis was based on whole-brain analysis, and no specific analysis of various networks in the brain was performed. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nThis was the first meta-analysis to systematically evaluate abnormal changes in the spontaneous neural activity of patients with Dn-FES by measuring different indices. We found varying degrees of increase and decrease in the spontaneous neural activity in Dn-FES patients, including activities in the frontal lobe, putamen, lateral globus pallidus, insula, cerebellum, and PCC. This study provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of Dn-FES from different perspectives. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9441467,"text_md5":"d7dca1126d75efeed971d2bad0482188","field_positions":{"authors":[0,124],"journal":[125,144],"publication_year":[146,150],"title":[161,306],"keywords":[320,472],"abstract":[485,1881],"body":[1890,17509]},"batch":2,"pmid":36059049,"doi":"10.30773\/pi.2022.0074","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9441467","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9441467"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9441467\">9441467<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9441467  Alterations in Spontaneous Brain Activity in Drug-Na\u00efve First-Episode Schizophrenia: An Anatomical\/Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis"}

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nSince the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most important genetic model for psychotic disorders, an increasing interest in its brain structural and functional abnormalities has arisen in the last decade. However, studies so far have reported inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aims of the present study are 1) to systematic review the literature on structural and functional brain abnormalities associated to 22q11.2 DS and 2) to identify the most consistently reported abnormalities through a meta-analysis of structural (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe following electronic databases were systematically searched: PubMed, ETHOS, Kings Open Portal, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINHAL. Studies were included if they presented original data, were written in English, had a sample size larger than 5, had a healthy control comparison group, and if they reported results from a whole brain analysis. As we were interested in identifying abnormalities in both brain structure and function, in the systematic review we included studies that used different imaging techniques (i.e. sMRI, fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). The meta-analysis was performed with studies reporting results in standardised-space coordinates (e.g. Talairach), using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method. Results were corrected at cluster level with family wise error correction (p=0.01) and 1000 permutations. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nSeventy-three original articles were included in the systematic review, 25 of these were also included in the meta-analysis. Forty-two sMRI, 23 fMRI and 11 DTI articles were retrieved. Only one study performed a direct comparison between 22q11.2 DS individuals with and without psychosis. \n\nThe systematic review revealed that the most affected areas were the frontal middle gyri bilaterally, the posterior cingulum bilaterally, the right cuneus, the precuneus bilaterally, the right superior temporal gyrus, the left parietal inferior gyrus and the left side of the cerebellum. \n\nThe meta-analysis revealed consistent abnormalities in a cluster located in the inferior parietal lobe (4936 voxels, peak of activation in the coordinate -44 -52 48) and extending to the superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. A second cluster of consistent activation is found in the posterior cingulate cortex (3104 voxels, peak of activation in the coordinate 6 -50 16). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe systematic review revealed widespread abnormalities throughout the brain, mainly within areas involved in visual and speech processing, language, and within association areas. The meta-analysis of structural and functional studies revealed consistent abnormalities in the inferior parietal lobe, an area consistently found affected in psychosis. \n\nOnly few studies on 22q11.2 DS individuals with psychosis were available and most studies included young individuals (mean age 15.12) rather than adults. 22q11.2 DS is one of the most compelling genetic models of schizophrenia, however most imaging studies do not provide clinical data on psychotic symptoms. This could partially be explained by the relatively low mean age of the overall sample; some participants could have been too young to manifest psychotic symptoms. Finally, the present study does not allow to make inferences on brain changes overtime as longitudinal studies were scarce. \n\nFuture studies should adopt a longitudinal design and investigate brain abnormalities in adults with 22q11.2 DS displaying symptoms of psychosis. This would help to clarify the brain structural and functional features associated with this particular form of psychosis and their longitudinal course. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n","metadata":{"pmcid":5887962,"text_md5":"b416f07e0fc4203d4e41ca7f8920dbc6","field_positions":{"authors":[0,150],"journal":[151,165],"publication_year":[167,171],"title":[182,291],"keywords":[305,305],"abstract":[318,4079],"body":[4088,4088]},"batch":2,"doi":"10.1093\/schbul\/sby018.963","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5887962","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5887962"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5887962\">5887962<\/a>","list_title":"PMC5887962  S176.

{"text":"Kotchoubey, Boris and Pavlov, Yuri G.\nFront Neurol, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Brain Data and the Outcome in Disorders of Consciousness\n\n# Keywords\n\nconsciousness\nimprovement criteria\nmeta-analysis\nminimally conscious state\nneurophysiological markers\nprognosis\npublication bias\nunresponsive wakefulness syndrome\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nA systematic search revealed 68 empirical studies of neurophysiological [EEG, event-related brain potential (ERP), fMRI, PET] variables as potential outcome predictors in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (diagnoses Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome [UWS] and Minimally Conscious State [MCS]). Data of 47 publications could be presented in a quantitative manner and systematically reviewed. Insufficient power and the lack of an appropriate description of patient selection each characterized about a half of all publications. In more than 80% studies, neurologists who evaluated the patients\u2019 outcomes were familiar with the results of neurophysiological tests conducted before, and may, therefore, have been influenced by this knowledge. In most subsamples of datasets, effect size significantly correlated with its standard error, indicating publication bias toward positive results. Neurophysiological data predicted the transition from UWS to MCS substantially better than they predicted the recovery of consciousness (i.e., the transition from UWS or MCS to exit-MCS). A meta-analysis was carried out for predictor groups including at least three independent studies with N\u2009>\u200910 per predictor per improvement criterion (i.e., transition to MCS versus recovery). Oscillatory EEG responses were the only predictor group whose effect attained significance for both improvement criteria. Other perspective variables, whose true prognostic value should be explored in future studies, are sleep spindles in the EEG and the somatosensory cortical response N20. Contrary to what could be expected on the basis of neuroscience theory, the poorest prognostic effects were shown for fMRI responses to stimulation and for the ERP component P300. The meta-analytic results should be regarded as preliminary given the presence of numerous biases in the data. \n \n\n# Body\n  \n\u2026the quality of methodological reporting in the social and behavioral science research literature is poor. Reports are often silent or ambiguous on important methodological and procedural matters making it difficult for the analyst to determine what was done. The metaanalyst who develops elaborate and detailed methodological criteria for study selection, therefore, will most likely find that study reports do not provide sufficient information for those criteria to be confidently applied. [Lipsey and Wilson ( ) (p. 22)] \n \nA systematic analysis of several published datasets can yield substantial new knowledge as compared with the data of each single experiment ( ). This insight, increasingly admitted during the last decades, underlies the use of meta-analyses and other kinds of quantitative reviews that can largely overcome the subjectivity and deliberateness of the \u201cgood old\u201d narrative reviews. The domain of the severe Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) is, however, still dominated by the latter genre. Thus a brief overview of journal publications about brain imaging data in DoC for the last 5\u2009years reveals that almost every fourth paper (exactly, 33 of the 137 papers) is a narrative review. Book publications further increase this number. \n\nThe notion DoC most usually includes two diagnostic entities: the vegetative state, or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), and the minimally conscious state (MCS) ( ,  ). To the best of our knowledge, the first systematic analysis of neurophysiological data in DoC was devoted to the question whether these data confirm the reality of the distinction between UWS and MCS ( ). The authors came to the conclusion that there were no reliable differences in terms of neurophysiological variables (mainly EEG, PET, and fMRI) between the two diagnoses. \n\nHannawi et al. ( ) concentrated on brain imaging studies and performed a voxel-based meta-analysis of 13 PET and fMRI studies in DoC patients, in which the corresponding data were reported. The authors identified a number of structures whose resting state activity was significantly decreased in patients as compared with healthy controls. On the other hand, they did not find convincing differences between UWS and MCS, which was in line with Liberati et al. ( ). Kondziella et al. ( ) came, however, to a different conclusion that brain connectivity data in rest and under passive stimulation (but not in active instruction conditions) reliably differ between UWS and MCS. Unfortunately, inclusion criteria in this study were not completely clear; thus the question still remains open whether late event-related brain potential (ERP) components (P300, N400) can be regarded as indicators of cortical connectivity, and therefore, the authors should either include all P300 and N400 studies in their analysis (if they answer this question positively), or exclude all of them (if they answer it negatively), but instead, they included only some of them. The data were not checked for publication bias, that is, the tendency for positive results or stronger effects to get published more readily than negative results or weaker effects ( ). The simplest index of this bias is a negative correlation between the size of the obtained effect and its reliability ( ). On the other hand, Kondziella et al. ( ) indicated a bias in patient selection. The risk of this bias was estimated as \u201chigh\u201d in 81.4% of the analyzed studies and as \u201cuncertain\u201d in further 11.6%. \n\nAlso, Bender et al. ( ) were interested in the abilities of neurophysiological techniques to distinguish between UWS and MCS. Their meta-analysis aimed not at the presence and size of the effects, but at the parameters of sensitivity and specificity. The authors concluded \u201c\u2026 that modern diagnostic techniques can already make a major contribution to the diagnostic assessment of MCS.\u201d The inspection of their empirical findings yields a modest support for this conclusion, because good sensitivity and specificity values were found only for the measures of quantitative EEG; ERP and fMRI measures revealed, to the contrary, only moderate specificity and rather low sensitivity that did not significantly differ from chance. \n\nKotchoubey ( ) carried out a quantitative analysis of 61 reports on ERPs in DoC. ERPs are the most frequently used neurophysiological technique in DoC, which, however, does not mean that they are also most useful. In general, the results of the analysis were rather disappointing. Most studies possessed such a low statistical power that their findings can at best be regarded as \u201cpreliminary results.\u201d In addition, there was strong evidence for a publication bias toward positive findings. \n\nHowever, there were good news. The above-mentioned deficits mainly concerned the studies where ERPs were compared between UWS and MCS, which largely concurs with the conclusions of Liberati et al. ( ). The negative tendencies were substantially less expressed in the literature about the relationship between ERP and the prognosis of DoC outcome. Furthermore, the power of the prognostic studies correlated positively, and the effect sizes (ESs) correlated negatively, with the rank of journals where the data were reported. This indicated that weaker but more reliable effects could be published more successfully in top-ranking journals than strong but less reliable ones. \n\nLike all areas in which there is no golden diagnostic standard, meta-analyses of novel diagnostic tests in the domain of DoC have a strong circular component. The expensive neurophysiological techniques are developed to complement imperfect clinical methods and to increase the diagnostic precision; but in a meta-analysis, these novel techniques are evaluated on the basis of the same (presumably imprecise) diagnostic criteria that these methods should improve! The lack of the golden diagnostic standard makes another strategy more preferable, i.e., a search for the measurements most reliably related to prognosis. The above-cited findings, that prognostic studies in DoC appear to have a higher quality than diagnostic studies, are in line with this view. \n\nThe aim of the present study was a systematic analysis of all publications relating any functional brain data recorded in UWS and MCS patients to their outcome several weeks or months after the measurement. Data using only anatomical brain measurements were not included in the present analysis. Each of the analyzed publications will hereafter be designated as \u201crecord.\u201d The term \u201cdataset\u201d will, in contrast, refer to any individual comparison between a neurophysiological variable (e.g., fMRI activation in a specific task) and an outcome variable (e.g., Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2014Extended, or GOSE ( )). One record can, therefore, contain many datasets. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and ES Calculation \n  \nA search in MEDLINE and SCOPUS was conducted on the 23 November 2017 by using search terms ((prognos* OR predict* OR outcome) AND (vegetative state OR minimally conscious state OR unresponsive wakefulness syndrome)) AND (eeg OR fmri OR event related potentials OR erp OR positron emission). No time limits were set for the search. In addition, the systematic reviews cited above in the Introduction as well as recent informal reviews on neurophysiology of DoC, were consulted. Eight hundred ninety-seven peer-reviewed records published in English, German, or Russian, were identified. After reading abstracts and removing duplicates, 822 of them were rejected as irrelevant. Full test was sought for the other 76 records. Seven of them were rejected because they did not contain any outcome data on DoC patients, or contained outcome data already published elsewhere. Further exclusion criteria were (a) case studies or series of cases; (b) using patients\u2019 survival, and not the clinical improvement, as the only prognostic criterion; (c) presentation of the results in such a general form that the size of the observed effects cannot be calculated; and (d) reporting the data of UWS and MCS patients together with other diagnoses such as coma, exit-MCS, or locked-in syndrome: on the basis of these criteria 22 records were rejected. Regarding (d), we accepted studies in which UWS and MCS data were reported together, but not those in which the sample included more than these two diagnoses and the reported data did not give the reader a possibility to distinguish between the different diagnostic groups. The process of the selection of relevant records is shown in Figure  . \n  \nFlow chart of the selection of records. \n  \nThe search resulted in 47 records containing a total of 381 datasets. These records are summarized in Table  . Effect size was calculated for each dataset (i.e., for each predictor\u2013outcome pair) on the basis of primary data on each individual patient presented in the tables of most studies, or chi-squared based on the same patient data, or the   t  -statistics. Only in one record, ES was calculated from a coefficient of correlation. All these parameters were converted into Cohen\u2019s   d   following the methods summarized by Lenhard and Lenhard ( ). If a resulting 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table contained a zero cell (e.g., all patients having a positive neurophysiological sign recovered), the blind application of the corresponding formulas results in   d  \u2009=\u2009infinite; to avoid this, we added 0.5 to all cells, as recommended by Nakagawa and Cuthill ( ). When   d  -values were included in further operations (added, averaged, etc.), they were weighted by inverse standard error (SE). \n  \nA summary of the 47 records included in the systematic review. \n  \n N (UWS\/MCS) means the number of UWS and MCS patients whose outcome and neurophysiological data were available. In the case of different number of patients available for different neurophysiological measurements, only the largest number is reported; it may be less than the total number of patients in the study  . \n\n NA, not available, AFR index, Amplitude\/Frequency\/Reactivity index; UWS, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; MCS, minimally conscious state; EMCS, Exit form MCS; GOS(E), Glasgow Outcome Scale (Extended), GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; DRS, Disability Rating Scale; LCF, levels of cognitive functioning scale; LoC, Level of Consciousness Scale; SEP, somatosensory evoked potentials; BAEP, brain stem auditory evoked potentials; dwPLI, debiased weighted phase lag index; SPECT, single-photon emission computed tomography; CRS-R, Coma Recovery Scale-Revised  . \n  \nA big and still underestimated problem of all quantitative reviews is the plenty of non-reported data. Several authors ( \u2013 ) indicated that measured but unreported variables constitute one of the main sources of false positive findings ubiquitous in biology and psychology and thus an important cause of the contemporary \u201creplication crisis\u201d ( ). When, and only when, it was evident for both present authors from the text of a paper that a neurophysiological variable was measured but not reported in relation to the outcome (or, rarely, reported as \u201cnon-significant\u201d), the ES of this variable was assumed to be 0, and the SE of ES was assumed to be equal to the median SE calculated for the reported variables in the same record. \n\nWhen the results presented several strongly correlated predictor variables (e.g., the same EEG variable in several adjacent regions), they were regarded as representing the same \u201cconstruct\u201d ( ), and the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the construct were calculated according to the formulas\n \nwhere   M   and   M  , SD  and SD  are mean and SD values for two to-be-combined variables, respectively. (Note that the formulas are so simple because both variables have the same   N  .) \n\n\n### Outcome Criteria \n  \nThe category \u201cbad outcome\u201d for UWS and MCS patients presumed remaining in the same condition. Deaths were included in this category only if it was clear that a patient died as a direct consequence of the brain lesion, otherwise excluded from the analysis. The category \u201cgood outcome\u201d has, on the other hand, two different definitions: minimal clinical improvement or regaining full consciousness.  For MCS, both criteria are the same, because their minimal improvement implies the transition to Exit-MCS. But this is not true for UWS, because their minimal improvement means only the transition to MCS. As shown in Section \u201c ,\u201d the two different improvement criteria of UWS yield different results. \n\nAvantaggiato et al. ( ) analyzed a group of DoC patients containing children and adolescents; because the authors presented individual data of each patient, we selected the results for patients >13\u2009years only. The category \u201cgood prognosis\u201d for MCS implied the recovery of consciousness. For UWS, however, it might include either the recovery of consciousness or the transition into MCS. All 381 datasets were included in the systematic review. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nQuality of the records was estimated on the basis of the QUADAS criteria ( ) that have been tailored, as recommended in the original publication, for the specific research field. Because Kondziella et al. ( ) expressed concerns about possible bias in patient selection, we recorded whether a publication included a patient flow chart, and whether it described explicit exclusion criteria for UWS and MCS patients or simply mentioned that all patients admitted in the clinics for a particular time period were investigated. We also marked the records in which obviously more neurophysiological data were collected than reported in the analysis of outcome prediction. Another quality index was the use of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R ( )) for DoC diagnostics, because this scale, though not being golden standard, possesses substantially better psychometric qualities than all other instruments for the assessment of DoC ( ). In addition, the impact factor (IF) of the publishing journal was included as an indirect quality criterion, because the data indicate high correlation between the IF and the informal reputation of the corresponding journal among neurologists ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nTwo additional inclusion criteria for meta-analyses were (1) at least three independent records reporting the same predictor variable or variables related to the same construct and (2) each of these records includes at least 10 patients. The criteria can be regarded as very liberal because, first, only three records and only 10 patients (who further should be subdivided into at least two groups) are rather low numbers, and second, the notion of construct is rather vague and permits to include into one group, for example, studies of P300 to simple tones and to patients\u2019 own names, thus increasing heterogeneity. On the basis of these criteria, 319 datasets were excluded (of course, this number would be larger if the criteria were more conservative). The remaining 62 datasets finally entered the meta-analysis. \n\nWe used a random-effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimator for pooling ESs. We assessed the level of heterogeneity between studies with a standard   Q  -test statistic as well as by   I   calculation ( ). Heterogeneity was regarded as significant when   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 or   I   >\u200950%. Potential publication bias for individual predictors was assessed with the Egger test for Funnel plot asymmetry and represented graphically with Begg\u2019s funnel plots of the ES versus its SE. Additionally, Rosenthal fail-safe test was also applied. All meta-analyses were performed using R package \u201cmetafor\u201d ( ) using inverted standard errors as weighting parameter. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Quality of Reporting \n  \nNone of the 47 records presented a flow chart depicting patient selection. The authors of 20 records (42.6%) explicitly state that they included all patients within some exactly described time period. Nine reports (19.1%) depicted at least some inclusion and\/or exclusion criteria. In the remaining 18 records, patient selection was not described. \n\nMost selected records present their data either for each individual patient or as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (or SE) for each relevant group (e.g., recovered versus non-recovered). Three records present data only in a general form (e.g., as correlations). Five records (10.6%) mention the size of some effects. \n\nCRS-R was used for the diagnosis of UWS and MCS in 29 records (61.7%); other studies employed Disability Rating Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, or other less powerful instruments. \n\nQuite surprisingly, only two records explicitly state that the neurologists who assessed the outcome were blinded to the neurophysiological data collected before. In six records, blindness of the outcome might be assumed because neurophysiological examination and outcome diagnostics were performed in different institutions. These eight records (17%) were combined into one \u201cblind\u201d group. In the majority of the records (83%), the outcome was diagnosed with knowledge of the neurophysiological findings. \n\nThe median time between the measurement and the outcome assessment was 6\u2009months, mean minimal time per record was 9\u2009months (range 1\u201336\u2009months), and the mean maximal time per record 16\u2009months (range 1.5\u2013150\u2009months). In 42 records (89%), this interval was same for all the examined patients. Seven records used broad variable intervals for different patients (1\u20136, 1\u201330, 2\u20139, 6\u201338, 10\u2013150, 26\u201336, and 24\u2013144\u2009months). One publication does not report the measurement\u2013outcome interval. \n\nThe mean total sample was 31.11\u2009\u00b1\u20093.66 patients, with a median of 21 patients and a range of 5\u2013123 patients. Eight records included <10 patients, 14 records had between 10 and 19 patients. Adding the case studies filtered out at the previous stage, we come to the result that about a half of all prognostic studies included <20 patients. The records that did not describe patient selection included significantly less patients (means 14.1 versus 43.0,   t  \u2009=\u20095.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) than records describing their selection process. \n\nThe median IF of the publishing journals was 3.87, range from 0 to 44. IF did not differ between the records with correctly versus incorrectly described patient selection. We hypothesized that studies with more patients (thus having higher power) are published in more prestigious journals, but the corresponding correlation was not significant (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.26,   p  \u2009=\u20090.078). However, studies employing CRS-R were published in journals with higher IF than studies that did not use this scale:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, Mann\u2013Whitney test. A few studies with blind outcome assessment included larger sample sizes than studies without outcome blindness (  t  \u2009=\u20092.35,   p  \u2009=\u20090.023) and were also published in more prestigious journals (  p  \u2009=\u20090.046, Mann\u2013Whitney test). \n\nNotably, we did not find a significant relationship between any of the variables and the time elapsed from the neurophysiological measurement till the assessment of the outcome. Non-weighted ES correlated with the mean time between neurophysiological measurement and outcome assessment with Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.09, with minimal time per study \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.18, with maximal time per study \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.07 (all nonsignificant). For weighted ES, the corresponding correlations were 0.03, \u22120.06, and \u22120.11, respectively (all nonsignificant). Likewise, correlations of the time interval with the SD of ES (as a measure of its reliability) were all between 0.00 and 0.03, and correlations of the time interval with sample size were between 0.00 and 0.06, all non-significant. \n\nAlso, the year of publication did not correlate with any other measures. The bibliographic literature gives a reason to expect that later publications might have large samples or smaller ESs than earlier ( ). Although the corresponding correlations were in the expected direction, they did not reach significance (year\/N: Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.12; year\/ES: \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.08). Also, the correlation between publication year and IF was close to 0 (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.03). \n\n\n### Publication Bias \n  \nThe inverted SE (1\/SE) was taken as a measure of the reliability of an ES. Across all datasets, the rank-order correlation between ES and its 1\/SE was weak but significant (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22,   k  \u2009=\u2009381,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The result might be biased because different records contribute disproportionally to the whole mass of data. However, the positive correlation between the ES and its SE became even stronger when calculated for the selected subset of datasets included in the meta-analysis (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47,   k  \u2009=\u200962,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), as well as for the ESs averaged for each record (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   k  \u2009=\u200947,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004). The results are shown in Figure  . \n  \nNegative correlations between effect size (ES) and its reliability, estimated by the inverted standard error (1\/SE), for all individual datasets [  (A)  : Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], datasets included in the meta-analysis [  (B)  : \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], and for mean ESs per record [  (C)  : \u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004]. The regression lines are presented for illustration only, not for quantitative analysis. \n  \nNote that the first analysis (across all datasets) overestimates the contribution of the records reporting many datasets. The last analysis (across averaged ES), to the contrary, may overestimate the contribution of the records presenting few or only one dataset. Despite this contrary bias, very similar results were obtained. To sum up, these data show a trend to selective publication of strong but unreliable effects. How serious the bias is in respect of each particular predictor variable will be discussed below. \n\n\n### UWS and MCS \n  \nThirteen of the 381 datasets included only MCS samples, 248 datasets included only UWS patients, and the remaining datasets included both diagnostic groups of DoC patients. \n\nWhile the main issue of the present study was outcome prediction on the basis of neurophysiological data, we also asked the question whether the outcome can be predicted simply from the diagnosis. Many authors of the reviewed articles also asked this question and answered it negatively. However, a meta-analysis of the combined data from the records where both diagnosis and prognosis could be followed revealed that MCS patients recovered consciousness significantly more frequently than UWS patients (Figure  ): mean ES\u2009=\u20090.84, 95% CI from 0.61 to 1.06. On the other hand, if the positive outcome of UWS patients is defined as any minimal improvement, i.e., the transition to the MCS, the diagnosis loses its predictory value (Figure  ). \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from the diagnosis. The criterion of improvement for all patients was recovery of full consciousness.   Q  , the corresponding   p  -value and   I   are estimates of between-study heterogeneity; symbols \u25a0 stay for the estimates of effect size (ES) in each single study, with the size of the symbol being proportional to the precision of the estimate. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals of ES. The diamond \u2666 is the estimate of the overall effect, the edges of the diamond represent the 95% confidence interval limits; CI, confidence interval; UWS and MCS, sample size of UWS and MCS patients in individual studies; N_UWS and N_MCS, overall sample size of the two patient groups. The resulting ES was tested for significance using   z  -criterion; the values of   z   and the corresponding   p   are given at the end of the lower left line. \n    \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from the diagnosis. The criterion of improvement was \u201cminimal improvement,\u201d that is for UWS patients, it was the transition to MCS, and for MCS patients, at least the transition to Exit-MCS. As can be seen, with this improvement criterion the diagnosis does not predict outcome. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n  \nBecause we found that the improvement criterion for UWS (transition to the MCS versus recovery of full consciousness, that is, exit-MCS) can play a role in the calculation of prediction effects, we compared weighted mean ES for the neurophysiological variables in three conditions: (i) prediction of the recovery of consciousness for MCS patients; (ii) prediction of the recovery of consciousness for UWS patients; and (iii) prediction of the transition to MCS for UWS patients. A one-way ANOVA across these three groups resulted in a highly significant effect:   F  (2,294)\u2009=\u200923.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001. The result does not change when we limit the analysis by only those datasets that will later enter the meta-analysis [  F  (2,60)\u2009=\u200919.88,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], or when we exclude all mixed datasets [  F  (2,86)\u2009=\u200912.08,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001]. Independently of the method of calculation, the mean weighted ES for the groups (i) and (ii) (i.e., different diagnoses, the same improvement criterion) were very similar and varied\u2014dependent on the selected data\u2014between 0.41 and 0.48. The mean weighted ES for the group (iii) was about three times larger (between 1.40 and 1.68) and differed significantly from both of them, although the groups (iii) and (ii) included patients with the same diagnosis and some datasets involved in these two groups might even include some of the same patients. To sum up, neurophysiological methods are significantly more successful in prediction of the transition from UWS to MCS than in prediction of the recovery of full consciousness. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of Predictory Constructs \n  \nAccording to the above results, we performed the meta-analysis separately for (a) prediction of any clinical improvement (for which UWS patients means at least transition to the MCS), and (b) prediction of the recovery of full consciousness. Sixty-two datasets comprising a total of 1,919 patients were analyzed. They involved the following potential predictors:\n   \nEEG reactivity to \u201cpassive\u201d stimulation (i.e., without an active instruction). Hypothesis: stronger EEG oscillatory responses\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG entropy indices. Hypothesis: higher EEG entropy\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG dominant oscillatory activity. Hypothesis: background activity closer to the alpha frequency\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nEEG Synek score ( ) is frequently used in the intensive care medicine for the prognosis of the outcome of acute coma. Hypothesis: higher score\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nfMRI BOLD response to passive (auditory or nociceptive) stimulation. Hypothesis: stronger response\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nResting state PET or SPECT metabolism. Hypothesis: closer to normal brain metabolism\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nN20 component of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). Hypothesis: normal N20\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nAuditory Mismatch Negativity (MMN) to a change in ongoing acoustic stimulation. Hypothesis: larger MMN\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nAuditory P300 as an index of complex processing in cortico-subcortical networks. Hypothesis: larger amplitude or shorter latency\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \nSpindle activity as an index of information processing in sleep ( ). Hypothesis: presence of sleep spindles\u2009=\u2009>\u2009better prognosis. \n  \n\nThe findings are summarized in Figures   and   and presented in more detail in Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material. \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from neurophysiological variables. The criterion of improvement for all patients was the recovery of consciousness. RE, random effects. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n    \nThe results of the meta-analysis for prediction of the outcome from neurophysiological variables. The criterion of improvement for UWS patients was the transition to MCS, and for MCS patients, the recovery of consciousness. The rest is the same as in Figure  . \n  \nOnly oscillatory EEG responses to passive stimulation appear to be reliably related to both prognostic criteria (i.e., minimal clinical improvement and the recovery of full consciousness). The included datasets are highly homogenous and yield a highly significant mean ES of 1.45 on a sample of 99 patients. Another prediction variable that significantly predicted the recovery of consciousness was brain metabolism assessed by PET\/SPECT. It attained a mean ES of 1.40 on a sample of 106 patients. The prognostic value of the MMN, P300, EEG entropy variables, and fMRI responses to passive stimulation was not significant and characterized by strong heterogeneity of the primary datasets. \n\nMore promising results have been obtained in relation to the minimal improvement criterion. In addition to the EEG reactivity, significant effects are found for the MMN and sleep spindles. Formally positive results are obtained for the SSEP component N20 and the background EEG frequency, but the data are too heterogeneous to make a conclusion. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAlthough the Section \u201cLimitation\u201d is frequently placed at the end of Discussion, we believe that particularly the discussion of meta-analytic data is useful to begin with limitations. One important limitation is that of the present work as such. As the manuscript was prepared for a special issue, we did not systematically address the authors of the original publications but relied solely on the published data including supplementary information. Although we believe that personal contact with the authors may have enhanced our knowledge, at the first step we did not use this strategy because it might have caused considerable delays. \n\nOther limitations of the meta-analysis are rather related to the limitations of the primary literature. A quantitative review can overcome some limitations of the reviewed studies, e.g., their small size (thus, it can reveal a consistent and significant effect on the basis of several inconsistent and non-significant ones), but it cannot remove the biases implied in its empirical basis. \n\nTo begin with the least, the quality of data reporting is far from the present-day standard. While Fritz et al. ( ) bristled that only 42% of empirical psychological studies report the size of their effects, in the present sample ES was mentioned only in five records (10.6%). Presenting a patient flow chart is already a standard in many fields of clinical research but fully unknown in the domain of DoC. About a half of the reviewed records neither describe inclusion and exclusion criteria nor even make a simple statement that all patients admitted to the hospital during some period were included. Thus, the concern of Kondziella et al. ( ) about possible bias in patient selection seems to be justified. \n\nThe majority of the reviewed studies employed a univariate approach, i.e., each predictor was separately compared with the target variable. Of course, this is a serious limitation because we know that the values of a regression strongly depend on the other predictor variables included or excluded in\/from the equation. Thus, a neurophysiological variable (e.g., P300), which appears useless as a single predictor, might reveal its effect in a particular combination with other predictors. A few groups have recently attempted to overcome this limitation and employed a multivariate approach to outcome prediction in DoC ( ,  ). This seems to be a perspective line of research, but now the number of such records is still too low to undertake a separate meta-analysis of these data. \n\nThe negative correlation between the description of patient selection and the number of patients suggests that selection bias might be particularly strong in small-size studies. Although the sample size in prognostic studies is on average larger than in studies comparing UWS and MCS, we found, together with single case studies, 33 records with less than 20 patients, which implies that even in the case of the equal distribution at least one of the outcome groups (recovered or non-recovered) includes <10 patients. Particularly, the studies with the total   N  \u2009<\u200910 result in huge confidence intervals making any reliable conclusion impossible. Of course, small or even single case studies may have sense at the very beginning of the research process, when nothing is known about an investigated phenomenon whatsoever. However, in such a case, one can expect an increase of sample sizes with the year of publication, but this correlation was not significant. \n\nStrong negative effects of underpowered studies on the quality of the reported data have thoroughly been discussed in the literature in general ( ,  ,  ) and specifically in neuroscience ( ,  ). Positive findings of tiny studies can only result from chance or selective data report. Our data show a consistent and significant correlation between the size of a prognostic effect and its standard error, indicating that stronger effects are less reliable. The correlation even withstood the removal of all datasets with <10 patients. As these small samples yield particularly large SE, the variability of SE was severely restricted, which might be expected to reduce the correlation coefficient. This was, however, not the case (Figure  ). \n\nAnother important limitation of nearly all studies was the lack of outcome blindness. Only two groups of authors clearly indicated that the diagnosis of the outcome was performed by neurologists without the knowledge of predictor values. One might argue that the diagnosis of recovery of consciousness (based on the criteria of consistent communication and functional use of objects) is quite easy and can hardly be biased by neurophysiological data. Even if this argument is true for exit-MCS, it is obviously false for the other broadly used improvement criterion of UWS patients, namely the transition to MCS. As the differential diagnostics between UWS and MCS is notoriously difficult ( ), any information about positive or negative neurophysiological findings could influence the diagnostic decision. If this influence really takes place, we can expect much stronger correlation of neurophysiological indices with the transition to MCS than with the transition to exit-MCS, because the latter diagnosis is easier and thus less affected by additional information. \n\nExactly this was true. When the improvement criterion for both diagnostic groups (UWS and MCS) was the transition to exit-MCS, the weighted average ES (in terms of Cohen\u2019s   d  ) was rather moderate, in any case slightly smaller than 0.5. But the transition of UWS patients to MCS (which is quite difficult from the diagnostic point of view) was strongly related to the neurophysiological findings, with the weighted average ES being >1.4. \n\nA potentially strong but still underestimated bias is related to unreported predictor variables. In most of the reviewed records, outcome prediction was not the main aim of the study, but rather a by-product of other analyses. Particularly, in such studies (though not only in these), many variables could be measured but not really reported. Sometimes, many variables are used in a UWS\/MCS comparison but not even mentioned in relation to prognosis, although one may suppose that they were also compared with the follow-up data. Less frequently prognostic effects are referred to as \u201clacking\u201d or \u201cnon-significant\u201d without further quantification. Simmons et al. ( ) suggest a very simple solution of the problem: whenever authors list their variables, they should add a short word \u201conly.\u201d We tried to counteract this false positive effect by assigning the value of 0 to the effects of obviously omitted variables (with its SE being assumed as the median SE of the reported variables). However, this method is not only imprecise but can also be biased, first, because the real number of such omitted variables may be much larger than a reader can guess, and second, because negative effects (i.e., those which run against the starting hypothesis, such as better neurophysiological responses in non-recovered patients) can be omitted more frequently than positive effects. \n\nWith this in mind, we understand that the data of meta-analyses should be taken with great caution. Nevertheless, we believe that a glance on the meta-analytic results can be of interest. First, the analysis was strongly complicated by the high variability of the primary records. Very small number of studies using exactly the same predictor and the same improvement criterion enforced us to combine similar methods, which resulted in high heterogeneity indices such as   I  . Poor prognostic features of the characteristics of fMRI reactivity might partially be attributed to this group of studies including fMRI responses to very different stimulations from pain to music. For the same reason, we excluded some possible predictors (e.g., responses to active behavioral instructions; ERP N400 component) that were employed in two records only. \n\nSecond, the empirical contribution of predictors does not necessarily follow their general theoretical value defined by basic neuroscience. This is quite demonstrative in the case of P300, one of the most useful and most widely employed indices in neuroscience whose effect in the prediction of the outcome turned out to be virtually 0. One might speculate that P300 is not immediately related to consciousness ( ), but, rather, to a more specific function such as working memory. Another possible reason may be the extreme difficulty of the separation between different P300 subcomponents (P3a and P3b) in the target population ( ). The subcomponents are usually distinguished by topography and responses to active instruction, but most DoC patients have changed ERP topography and do not respond to instruction. If the results of this preliminary analysis should be used to determine which lines of research should not be recommended for future studies, P300 is the first candidate for such a negative recommendation. Also, the importance of the (highly expensive) fMRI predictors might similarly be overestimated on the basis of their theoretical importance. \n\nOscillatory EEG responses to stimulation showed, to the contrary, most promising effects, which agree well with the results of Bender et al. ( ) obtained on the basis of different data. \n\nAlthough EEG reactivity was measured to very different stimuli [e.g., to passive ( ) or forced eyes opening ( ,  ), to pain ( ,  ), to warm water ( ), and no description was given by Sar\u00e0 et al. ( )] and the definition of reactivity substantially varied, the results are very homogenous across the reports. Moreover, this was the only group of predictor variables whose predictive value was significant for both improvement criteria (transition from UWS to MCS and the recovery of consciousness). Publication bias was also presented in these data, but it was less strong than for many other predictors (see Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). \n\nOther perspective variables are brain metabolism (estimated by means of PET or SPECT) and the presence of sleep spindles in the EEG. Recent sleep data indicate a vital importance of spindles in information processing during sleep, which affects numerous cognitive processes in the subsequent wakefulness ( ,  ,  ). DoC belongs to rare medical conditions characterized by severe deficits, or even complete absence, of sleep spindles, also in patients with relatively preserved sleep structure ( ,  ). We believe that the role of sleep spindles in the outcome prediction in DoC should be explored in future work. \n\nBoth MMN and SSEP are proven outcome predictors for acute coma ( ,  ). However, their value for the chronic DoC remains unclear. The present findings indicate their prognostic effects for the transition from UWS to MCS but not for recovery of consciousness. \n\nThe data further show that the predictive value of the auxiliary (e.g., neurophysiological) variables should be compared with the values of clinical variables. In the currently reviewed data, MCS patients had about 4.5 times better chances (if we take the lower limit of the 95% CI, three times better chances) to regain consciousness than UWS patients. It is true that we analyzed only records implementing the neurophysiological approach and missed similar data in the other publications not using neurophysiological variables. Nevertheless, the effect is very strong and, as far as we can judge, not strongly biased (as it was not a desired effect). This indicates the necessity to integrate neurophysiological and clinical predictors within a multivariate approach in further studies. This integration could be more productive in both diagnostic and prognostic respects than the attempts to oppose different classes of variables to each other. \n\nThese considerations can only be conceived of as preliminary. It should be stressed that all biasing factors discussed above act in the same direction, potentially increasing the number of   false positive   results. The general critique of Brok et al. ( ) remains valid also for the current study: as long as the original studies do not present all information, meta-analyses can only try to diminish, but not abolish the positive bias. If we want to eliminate the bias, (i) small-size studies should be avoided (for prediction studies, groups of recovered\/non-recovered should include at least 20 patients each); (ii) a flow chart should make evident the procedure of patient selection; (iii) neurologists assessing the target variable (i.e., change of the diagnosis) should be completely blinded regardless the values of neurophysiological predictors; (iv) the full list of measured variables including all potential predictors should be presented from the beginning of a report (in a Methods section); (v) the intervals (a) between the accident and the neurophysiological measurement, and (b) between this measurement and the follow-up assessment should be specified; finally, (vi) all positive   and negative   (e.g., non-significant relationships) results should be described in the same quantitative manner, either including the size of all effects, or permitting to calculate this size (e.g., mean and SD for the recovered and non-recovered groups). \n\nTherefore, the numbers presented in Figures   and   and in the Supplementary Materials can now be regarded, not as estimates of real effects, but rather, as upper limits of these effects. The current state of affairs is yet far away from the level at which any practical recommendation can be given except the recommendation to be highly careful with interpretations. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nBoth authors performed data search and analyses.

Recent brain imaging studies suggest abnormal brain activity underlying psychopathic behavior. No reliable pattern of altered neural activity has been disclosed so far. This study sought to identify consistent changes of brain activity in psychopaths and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. First, we used activation likelihood estimation (p < 0.05, corrected) to meta-analyze brain activation changes associated with psychopathy across 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reporting 753 foci from 155 experiments. Second, we characterized the ensuing regions functionally by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database (p < 0.05, corrected). Psychopathy was consistently associated with decreased brain activity in the right laterobasal amygdala, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilaterally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. A robust increase of activity was observed in the fronto-insular cortex on both hemispheres. Data-driven functional characterization revealed associations with semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal and fronto-insular cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal and left fronto-insular), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional as well as cognitive reward processing (right amygdala and fronto-insular cortex). Aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy is located in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. Physiological mental functions fulfilled by these brain regions correspond to disturbed behavioral patterns pathognomonic for psychopathy. Hence, aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n Psychopathy   is a term derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (soul) and \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (suffering). The term has undergone several shifts of meaning in the history of psychiatry. While it was originally associated with the notion of organic inferiority , Kurt Schneider (1923) used it as an umbrella term for what we would call personality disorders nowadays . Among the variants of psychopathy (i.e., personality disorder) that Kurt Schneider described, the type of the   affectionless psychopath   came closest to our current use of the term. Less than two decades after Schneider, American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley (1941) published his most influential monograph,   The Mask of Sanity  . In this book, Cleckley not only provided rich case descriptions but also a clinical profile of criteria that psychopaths would fulfill. Among these criteria were pathological egocentrism, the inability to love others, deceitfulness, and a lack of remorse or shame. Both Kurt Schneider (1923) and Hervey Cleckley (1941) emphasized the importance of callousness and the lack of emotional resonance as pathognomonic symptoms of the disorder.  Others also emphasized that social negativism is the most elementary datum of psychopathy . \n\nIn contrast to antisocial (or dissocial) personality disorder according to the American Psychiatric Association (2013) and the World Health Organization (1992) , the distinguishing hallmarks of psychopathy are a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold interpersonal style . While most psychopaths can meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, most individuals with antisocial personality disorder do not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Psychopathy is of high public concern due to its association with violence and offense recidivism.  Although psychopathy is considered a relatively rare phenomenon (with the prevalence estimated at about 1% of the general population ), psychopaths commit a disproportionate amount of crime , especially of violent offenses. The odds of violent re-offending are more than twice as high in psychopathic offenders as in non-psychopathic offenders. \n\nIn the recent past, neuroimaging studies have sought to identify brain abnormalities underlying psychopathy.  However, a considerable variability in results across studies has been pointed out, which may be due to differences in design (e.g., active vs. passive tasks), analysis (e.g., group comparisons vs. correlational analyses), and sample sizes.  Furthermore, differences in measurement of psychopathy (e.g., clinical vs. self-report; different cutoff thresholds) and sample demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, incarcerated vs. non-incarcerated) might introduce inhomogeneity. Given this heterogeneity of neuroimaging results, it has been deemed \u201cpremature to interpret certain findings as support for any particular theoretical viewpoint\u201d regarding affected neural circuits.  Put differently, it still remains an open question whether psychopathy is based on a robust organic substrate or merely reflects a variant of bad character traits. A summary of the extant imaging data is urgently needed to identify potential neural correlates of psychopathy. For an objective assessment of inter-study concordance, automated meta-analyses that quantify the level of concordance and allow identification of brain regions associated with significant convergence in a testable manner are preferable. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE), firstly described by Turkeltaub et al. (2002) and subsequently refined , meets these demands and represents the most widely accepted approach for such quantitative integration of neuroimaging findings. Here, we used ALE to locate abnormal brain activity associated with psychopathy. \n\nThe mere localization of aberrant brain activity leaves unclear, however, whether functional brain alterations can account for pertinent psychopathology in psychopaths. To remove this ambiguity, we furthermore statistically assessed the physiological mental functions of the regions where we found convergence of altered brain activity associated with psychopathy. That is, we did not refer to previous assumptions in the literature on the putative psychological functions of the respective approximate brain regions. We rather statistically linked psychological functions to the exact clusters revealed by our meta-analysis by employing meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. This combination of functional localization and characterization allows for observer-independent linking of pathophysiology to psychopathology. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \n#### Data selection \n  \nA principled procedure to identify the relevant experimental studies was used. First, we selected studies through a standard search in the PubMed ( ) and ISI Web of Science ( ) databases using the terms \u2018psychopathy\u2019 or \u2018psychopathic\u2019 in combination with \u2018fMRI\u2019, \u2018functional MRI\u2019, \u2018functional magnetic resonance\u2019, \u2018PET\u2019, \u2018positron emission\u2019, \u2018ASL\u2019, \u2018arterial spin labeling\u2019, \u2018MEG\u2019, \u2018magnetoencephalography\u2019, \u2018neuroimaging\u2019, or \u2018imaging\u2019. Second, further studies were found by means of the \u2018related articles\u2019 function of the PubMed database and by tracing the references from the identified papers and review articles. Task-based neuroimaging experiments were considered relevant when they reported either (1) direct group comparisons between psychopathic und non-psychopathic subjects or (2) correlations of brain activity with an established measure of psychopathy (e.g., the revised Psychopathy Checklist [PCL-R] ). Both approaches are valid to operationalize alterations in brain activity associated with psychopathy because psychopathy can be conceptualized categorically as well as dimensionally . Importantly, both approaches included in our meta-analysis related psychopathy to established measures of this disorder. Additionally, only experiments reporting results of whole-brain group analyses with coordinates referring to a standard reference space (Talairach-Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI]) were included. Results of region-of-interest analyses and studies not reporting stereotaxic coordinates were excluded. \n\nOn the basis of these search criteria, 28 papers were found to be eligible for inclusion into the meta-analyses ( ). Only functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) but no positron emission tomography (PET), arterial spin labeling (ASL) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies fulfilled our search criteria. Together, these papers reported 753 foci obtained from 155 experiments (with \u201cexperiment\u201d referring to an individual contrast reported in this paper; cf.,  ). The count of these foci was composed of 150 activations from 38 direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and 95 foci of positive correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 43 analyses as well as 234 deactivations from 37 direct group comparisons (psychopaths < non-psychopaths) and 274 foci of negative correlations between brain activity and psychopathy scales from 37 analyses. Differences in coordinate spaces (Talairach vs. MNI space) were accounted for by transforming coordinates reported in Talairach space into MNI coordinates using a linear transformation . \n\nFirst, convergence of all reported foci was analyzed for the main effect of aberrant brain activity in psychopaths (155 experiments, 753 foci). Furthermore, we assessed convergence of reported activation foci indicating increased brain activity in psychopaths by pooling direct group comparisons (psychopaths > non-psychopaths) and positive correlational analyses (81 experiments, 245 foci). In an analogous manner (i.e., by pooling group comparisons and correlational analyses), we tested for convergence of reported deactivation foci (74 experiments, 508 foci). The denoted sample sizes, i.e., numbers of experiments, have been shown to be sufficient to achieve robust meta-analytic estimates . \n\n\n#### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using the revised ALE algorithm for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging results . This algorithm aims to identify areas with a convergence of reported coordinates across experiments that is higher than expected from a random spatial association. Reported foci are treated as centers of 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus.  Here, the between-subject variance is weighted by the number of participants per study, since larger sample sizes should provide more reliable approximations of the \u201ctrue\u201d activation effect and should therefore be modeled by more \u201cnarrow\u201d Gaussian distributions. \n\nSubsequently, probabilities of all foci reported of a given experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation (MA) map ( ).  Notably, foci were organized by subject group, which prevents multiple foci from a single experiment from cumulatively influencing MA values.  This approach hence prevents multiple experiments performed by one subject group from cumulatively influencing ALE values. It can thus be excluded that effects are amplified by non-orthogonal contrasts (i.e., from the same study) being submitted to the same analysis. Voxelwise ALE scores (union across these MA maps) then quantified the convergence across experiments at each location in the brain. To distinguish \u201ctrue\u201d from random convergence, ALE scores were compared to an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association among all MA maps. The resulting random-effects inference focuses on the above-chance convergence across studies rather than the clustering within a particular study.  This null hypothesis was derived by computing the distribution that would be obtained when sampling a voxel at random from each of the MA maps and taking the union of these values in the same manner as for the (spatially contingent) voxels in the original analysis.  The p-value of a \u201ctrue\u201d ALE score was then given by the proportion of equal or higher values obtained under the null distribution. The resulting nonparametric p-values were then assessed using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE ) to correct for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) and transformed into z scores for display . \n\nFor anatomical labeling, we capitalized on cytoarchitectonic maps of the human brain provided by the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) Anatomy Toolbox . Clusters were thus assigned to the most probable histologically defined area at the respective location. This probabilistic histology-based anatomical labeling is reported in the results tables. References to details regarding cytoarchitecture are given in the table notes. \n\n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nFunctional characterization intends to link topographically defined brain regions with corresponding psychological processes by testing which kind of experiments are most likely to activate a given region. To functionally characterize regions exhibiting aberrant activity related to psychopathy (i.e., the regions revealed by our meta-analysis; cf.  ), we made use of the BrainMap database ( ) that currently contains \u2248 7,500 experiments in healthy subjects (experiments investigating age, gender, disease, or drug effects excluded). BrainMap meta-data provide information on behavioral domain and paradigm class of each neuroimaging experiment included in the database. Behavioral domains describe the mental processes isolated by the statistical contrasts  and comprise the main categories action, cognition, emotion, interoception, perception, as well as their subcategories. Paradigm classes specify the task employed in the corresponding neuroimaging studies (see   for the complete BrainMap taxonomy). To describe the functional roles of the candidate regions, we used a reverse inference approach, which tests the probability of a mental process being present, given knowledge that a particular brain region is activated.  More precisely, the functional profile of a region was determined by over-representation of mental processes (i.e., behavioral domains and paradigm classes) in the experiments activating the respective cluster relative to the entire BrainMap database using a binomial test.  The significance threshold was set to p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). To draw a more differentiated picture and complement this view by providing additional information on weaker associations, we also report both forward inference (probability of observing activity in a brain region given knowledge of the psychological process) and reverse inference (probability of a psychological process being present given knowledge of activation in a particular brain region) at a more liberal threshold (p < 0.05, uncorrected) in the supplement. This approach provides an objective and quantitative attribution of mental functions to brain regions in contrast to commonly used qualitative and subjective interpretation of activation foci in neuroimaging. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Coordinate-based meta-analysis \n  \nAcross 155 experiments, convergence of aberrant brain activity in psychopathy was observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex on both hemispheres, in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in the fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum, and in the laterobasal subdivision of the right amygdala ( ;  ). The follow-up analysis of   increased   neural activity associated with psychopathy indicated convergence in the left and right fronto-insular cortex extending into the right claustrum ( ). In contrast, convergence of   decreased   brain activity in psychopathy was located in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex, and the right laterobasal amygdala ( ). Taken together, the follow-up analyses were able to unambiguously classify each malfunctioning region as showing either increased or decreased activity. That is, our analyses did not identify any region that was not selectively hyper- or hypoactivated. Contribution analyses did not suggest a specific stimulus or task characteristic to critically drive the effects. It can thus not be inferred that certain kinds of design lead to differences in a particular region. \n\n\n### Functional characterization \n  \nTo obtain an objective description of the tasks recruiting regions that feature aberrant activity associated with psychopathy and thus provide a link to the psychopathology of psychopathy, we conducted a functional characterization of the regions that were found in our meta-analysis. Hereby, psychological terms were related to the respective region as registered in the BrainMap database, i.e., on basis of functional experiments in healthy subjects ( ;  ). \n\nThe right lateral prefrontal cortex was significantly associated with action execution and at the more liberal threshold also with pain perception. In contrast, the left lateral prefrontal cluster was significantly associated with phonological (and semantic) language processing. At the relaxed threshold, also the dorsomedial prefrontal region was related to semantic language processing but was most robustly linked to social cognition. A significant above-chance association with the emotional domain was found for the laterobasal amygdala cluster. Lowering the statistical threshold specified an association with reward processing within the emotional domain. In an analogous manner, the right fronto-insular cluster related to reward processing, however, within the cognitive domain. The functional profile of the left fronto-insular cluster, in contrast, resembled that of the left lateral prefrontal cortex with a focus on language\/speech processing, including delayed matching-to-sample tasks, as well as in addition pain processing. \n\nTaken together, we found decreased activity in regions associated with action control, semantic language processing, pain processing, social cognition, and emotional reward. Increased activity was observed in regions involved in cognitive reward and also in semantic language and pain processing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study sought to identify robust alterations of brain activity associated with psychopathy and to investigate whether these could explain known psychopathology. To this end, we combined meta-analyses of whole-brain neuroimaging studies of psychopathy with functional characterization of the obtained regions using meta-data of a large-scale neuroimaging database. Our meta-analysis revealed aberrant brain activity associated with psychopathy converging in frontal, insular, and limbic regions. Post-hoc analyses in combination with data-driven functional characterization indicated decreased activity in regions crucial for semantic language processing (left lateral prefrontal cortex), action execution and pain processing (right lateral prefrontal cortex), social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and emotional reward processing (right amygdala). In contrast, increased activity was located in a region for cognitive reward processing (right fronto-insular cortex) and another region associated with semantic language and pain processing (left fronto-insular cortex). \n\nThe observation of altered activity in two regions that were associated with semantic language processing fits well with previous evidence from psychological experiments showing abnormal processing of semantic and affective verbal information including vocal affect recognition in psychopathy . In this context, dysfunctional affect-language interactions have been proposed in psychopaths (\u201cThey know the words, but not the music\u201d).  The concomitance of increased and decreased activity in two nearby regions involved in semantic verbal processing (left fronto-insular and lateral prefrontal cortex) might seem confusing   prima facie   but reflect an imbalance of closely related brain networks as recently observed in affective disorders . \n\nAberrant (i.e., decreased) activity converged in a cluster within the right lateral prefrontal cortex that turned out to be associated with action execution. This finding might represent the neural correlate of impaired action control in psychopathy . This interpretation is supported by electroencephalographic data suggesting that poor response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits is predicated on reduced frontal function . In addition, the improvement of weak response inhibition associated with psychopathic traits after non-invasive electrical stimulation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex seems to confirm the supposed association . At a liberal threshold, this cluster as well as the cluster in the left fronto-insular cortex were also related to pain processing according to our functional characterization. Although caution is warranted, this result matches evidence suggesting psychopathy is linked to altered perception and tolerance as well as empathy of pain . \n\nThe dorsomedial prefrontal cortical region, where we found decreased activity, was significantly associated with social cognition, which includes empathy, morality, and theory of mind. A previous meta-analysis of the neural correlates of moral cognition in healthy subjects showed that the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is consistently involved in all these three subdomains.  Moreover, our meta-analytic finding likely constitutes the neural basis of sociopathy or being affectionless (in Kurt Schneider\u2019s sense) as the core trait of psychopathy implying lack of empathy and remorse. The dysfunction of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex may result from or in altered functional connectivity of this region, which has been reported elsewhere and is most likely based on its reduction in gray matter . \n\nFinally, our analyses demonstrated consistently decreased activity in a laterobasal region of the amygdala that related to emotional reward processing, but increased activity in a brain region associated with cognitive reward processing, namely the right fronto-insular cortex. This down-regulation of affective in favor of cognitive brain regions may underlie pathognomonic shallow affect in psychopathy. Consistent with this notion, it has been noted that callous-unemotional traits are behavioral sequelae of deficient amygdala responsiveness . Also here, the imbalance of affective vs. cognitive regions might rest upon aberrant functional connectivity in the context of gray matter reduction in psychopathy . \n\nSo far, no consistent pattern of structural brain alterations in psychopathy has been identified. However, evidence of gray matter thinning in lateral and medial prefrontal as well as in temporal cortical regions suggests a link between structural perturbations and aberrant activity in these regions that we identified in this meta-analysis.  These morphological changes may be associated with certain psychopathic traits and in particular be evident in so-called unsuccessful psychopaths , i.e., individuals whose rule-breaking and dissocial behavior has led to legal action or punishment. \n\nA limitation of this meta-analyis (but meta-analyses in general) is that not all available functional imaging studies on psychopathy fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The exclusion of studies restricting their analyses to a limited numbers of regions (i.e., region-of-interest approaches) may explain why our meta-analysis did not locate reliably altered activity in regions that one would have expected from the literature, e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex. However, it did confirm abnormalities in other notorious regions implicated in psychopathy such as the amygdala. Both regions are part of a \u201cparalimbic system\u201d that has been proposed to be dysfunctional in psychopathy by Kiehl and colleagues  and i.a. includes the insula, which also emerged in our meta-analysis. In short, our analyses corroborate the paralimbic system dysfunction model of psychopathy, if not with respect to every implicated region. Another model of psychopathy by Blair and colleagues proposed a deficit in the so-called violence inhibition mechanism, which normally leads to a withdrawal reaction of the aggressor when another individual shows signs of distress.  Proper functioning of this mechanism has been assumed to be a prerequisite for moral and empathic social behavior.  The meta-analytic finding of altered activity in a region for cognitive control (right lateral prefrontal cortex) and moral cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) might be regarded as neurobiological underpinning of this neurocognitive model of psychopathy. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the functional characterization of the regions that we found in our meta-analysis matches well with aberrant behavioral patterns observed in psychopaths. However, it has to be kept in mind that the putatively underlying neuropsychological deficits might reflect overall alterations, whereas the neural alterations might be rather specific to a particular construct. Alternatively, the neuropsychological deficits might reflect specific alterations, while the neural differences might be rather generic effects in polymodal regions of the cortex.  We would thus argue that the decoding findings suggest specific avenues to test the dominant neurobiological accounts of psychopathy. \n\nIn summary, our analyses robustly pinpoint aberrant brain activity related to psychopathy in prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions. These regions may serve as targets for pharmacological interventions or brain stimulation techniques. Their alterations in activity may be based on structural brain changes. The finding of aberrant activity in both limbic and prefrontal regions may reconcile Kiehl\u2019s paralimbic dysfunction hypothesis  with Blair\u2019s violence-inhibition-mechanism-deficit theory . Furthermore, our results objectively illustrate that the (physiological) mental functions fulfilled by the respective brain regions correspond with the deviant behavioral patterns that are characteristic of psychopathy. In other words, the results show that aberrant brain activity may not just be an epiphenomenon of psychopathy but directly related to the psychopathology of this disorder. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6344321,"text_md5":"1d6fc15119d7fc7db7205c4580942f90","field_positions":{"authors":[0,183],"journal":[184,198],"publication_year":[200,204],"title":[215,304],"keywords":[318,318],"abstract":[331,2187],"body":[2196,26516]},"batch":2,"pmid":30038232,"doi":"10.1038\/s41380-018-0122-5","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6344321","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6344321"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6344321\">6344321<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6344321  A View Behind the Mask of Sanity: Meta-Analysis of Aberrant Brain Activity in Psychopaths"}
{"text":"Masharipov, Ruslan and Korotkov, Alexander and Medvedev, Svyatoslav and Kireev, Maxim\nSci Rep, 2022\n\n# Title\n\nEvidence for non-selective response inhibition in uncertain contexts revealed by combined meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis of fMRI data\n\n# Keywords\n\nCognitive neuroscience\nMotor control\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nResponse inhibition is typically considered a brain mechanism selectively triggered by particular \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli or events. Based on recent research, an alternative non-selective mechanism was proposed by several authors. Presumably, the inhibitory brain activity may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by any imperative stimuli, including Go stimuli, when the context is uncertain. Earlier support for this notion was mainly based on the absence of a significant difference between neural activity evoked by equiprobable Go and NoGo stimuli. Equiprobable Go\/NoGo design with a simple response time task limits potential confounds between response inhibition and accompanying cognitive processes while not preventing prepotent automaticity. However, previous neuroimaging studies used classical null hypothesis significance testing, making it impossible to accept the null hypothesis. Therefore, the current research aimed to provide evidence for the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials using Bayesian analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Thirty-four healthy participants performed a cued Go\/NoGo task with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. To independently localize brain areas associated with response inhibition in similar experimental conditions, we performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal-probability Go\/NoGo tasks. As a result, we observed overlap between response inhibition areas and areas that demonstrate the practical equivalence of neuronal activity located in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, obtained results favour the existence of non-selective response inhibition, which can act in settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResponse inhibition is the ability to suppress inappropriate, automatic, reflexive, or habitual prepotent responses to produce a controlled goal-directed response . It is generally accepted in the literature that response inhibition works in close relation to other processes associated with cognitive control, such as working memory, voluntary attention, conflict monitoring, and action selection . Moreover, response inhibition is thought to represent a multifaceted phenomenon rather than a unitary brain mechanism. A distinction is made between action cancellation and action restraint  as well as between reactive and proactive response inhibition mechanisms . \n\nAccording to the conventional view, the response inhibition process is selectively triggered by \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli that result in increased neuronal activity in brain structures responsible for inhibitory control . However, in several cases, the concept of selective response inhibition fails to explain observed behavioural and neurophysiological phenomena. Manipulating the probability of the occurrence of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli and the subjects\u2019 awareness of the probability of the appearance may slow down the motor response . Moreover, when necessary to rapidly suppress a specific action, the action is inhibited along with all other potential actions. That is, such inhibition can affect the entire motor system . In an attempt to explain the effects mentioned above, several authors proposed the concept of non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) response inhibition . It is thought that these non-selective mechanisms serve to prevent inappropriate or premature responses at the expense of the speed of execution of correct actions. First, response inhibition mechanisms may non-selectively inhibit all potential responses to further selectively execute an appropriate response (non-selective inhibition of multiple concurrent motor responses). Second, inhibition may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by the occurrence of any imperative stimuli instructing on the necessity to suppress or execute a prepared action (non-selectivity of inhibitory stimulus perception). In the present work, we consider the latter mechanism. \n\nA tentative neurophysiological model of the non-selective or \u201cglobal\u201d response inhibition involved in the resolution of interference between several competing response options was proposed by Frank  and included the cortico-subthalamic \u201chyper-direct\u201d pathway  which is capable of rapidly and non-selectively suppress all potential response options. As the research area developed, it was hypothesized that the model might be applied not only to tasks with multiple concurrent response options but also to simpler tasks where the subject has to choose between executing and refraining from an action . The authors used a cued equiprobable Go\/NoGo task, wherein a preparatory cue stimulus indicated the probability of a NoGo stimulus occurrence. A simple equiprobable Go\/NoGo was chosen instead of a complex Go\/NoGo task to limit confounds between response inhibition and the accompanying cognitive processes . Complex Go\/NoGo tasks usually utilize the low probability of NoGo stimulus, difficulties in identifying NoGo signals, high attentional or working memory loads. Although one of the possible ways to build up a prepotent response tendency is to bias the Go\/NoGo probabilities in favour of Go stimuli, it is not necessary when the design involves a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and reduces the complexity of the identification of Go and NoGo signals to a single bit of information . In these conditions, a stimulus that does not require a response elicits subthreshold automatic motor activations that do not become overt because they are counteracted by fast automatic response inhibition . \n\nWithin the framework of the selective inhibition model, the inhibition process would only be triggered by the identification of the NoGo stimulus. According to the hypothesis of non-selective inhibition, when the context is uncertain (equal probability of NoGo and Go stimuli), the need for response inhibition arises for both NoGo and Go trials. Experimental assessment of the hypotheses revealed no statistically significant differences between the NoGo and Go trials in both the amplitude of the early components of event-related potentials (ERP)  and the level of neuronal activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . At the same time, a significant difference in early ERP amplitudes (peaked at 170\u00a0ms) was found in uncertain equiprobable NoGo and Go trials compared to certain Go-control trials, where no inhibition is required . The authors considered this fact as evidence for the presence of a \u201cnon-selective\u201d inhibitory mechanism that is not specific to the processing of NoGo signals. The analysis of early ERP components suggests that non-selective inhibition may blindly suppress any automatic response when the context is uncertain, acting as a gating mechanism controlling the initiation of a prepared, prepotent response. \n\nHowever, a critical limitation of the above-mentioned studies was that the authors could not accept the null hypothesis, so they did not provide direct proof of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity level between Go and NoGo trials in inhibition-related brain structures. Indeed, within the framework of classical (frequentist) null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we cannot accept the null hypothesis based on the absence of a significant difference. We can only reject it. Thus, the question of experimental support for non-selective response inhibition remains unanswered, and answering this question requires overcoming the methodological limitation of NHST, which is possible using Bayesian statistics . \n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to verify the non-selective response inhibition hypothesis by using the fMRI data from an equiprobable Go\/NoGo task. Based on the results of previous studies, it may be suggested that if the hypothesis on the non-selectivity of inhibition is correct, then the brain structures responsible for response inhibition will demonstrate practically equivalent levels of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials. Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was applied to assess this prediction. Instead, if the hypothesis on the selectivity of response inhibition is correct, then activation of inhibition-related brain structures will be observed in the NoGo conditions compared to the Go conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### A meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal probability Go\/NoGo tasks \n  \nGiven that a practically equivalent level of neuronal activity can be identified not only for response inhibition-related structures, but also, for example, those related to sensory processing of visual stimuli, working memory, and attention, we conducted a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to independently localize brain structures associated with response inhibition. Studies using equal probability Go\/NoGo tasks were selected for meta-analysis. We searched for studies that, similar to the investigation by Albares et al.  and Criaud et al. , compared neuronal activity in the condition of equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli with the control Go condition, in which the subject did not need to inhibit the prepared action. We hypothesized that inhibition would be non-selectively elicited by both equiprobable Go and NoGo-stimuli when the context is uncertain. To test the non-selective inhibition hypothesis, we considered similar Go\/NoGo tasks with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo-stimuli. We did not consider Go\/NoGo tasks with rare NoGo-stimuli, since studies using them have previously shown the involvement of selective response inhibition . \n\nWe searched for these studies in the PubMed database in the period from 01\/01\/2000 to 15\/07\/2019 using the following keywords: \u201c((fmri) OR (functional magnetic resonance)) AND ((nogo) OR (no-go)).\u201d Four additional studies were identified through manual searches. As a result, 726 papers were identified. At the first stage of selection, we excluded reviews, meta-analyses and papers repeatedly reporting the results of fMRI studies (see the flow chart of analysis in Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nFlow chart of study selection in the meta-analysis. \n  \n\nStudies dealing with Flanker task modifications of Go\/NoGo task or based on unequal probability of appearance of Go and NoGo trials were also excluded from the analysis. As a result, 593 papers were excluded. The task designs of the remaining 113 papers provided for equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation. At the next step, 82 of the papers were excluded based on the following criteria: auditory and sensorimotor Go\/NoGo tasks were used; only emotion-laden task conditions were used (emotionally neutral conditions were either absent or not considered separately); required Go-control condition (100% probability of the Go stimulus presentation) was not used; the coordinates for the contrast of interest \u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control\u201d within a group of healthy subjects were not reported. In 11 out of the 31 remaining studies, healthy volunteer subjects under the age of 18 (children and adolescents) were studied. These articles were also excluded from the analysis because this study focused on brain activity of healthy, adult subjects. In all remaining studies except one, only block designs were used. To make our sample more homogeneous, we excluded the only eligible study with an event-related design . The final meta-analysis included 20 studies (452 healthy subjects, mean age 29\u00a0years) with a total of 210 foci (for more details, see the \u201c \u201d, Table  ). All coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Lancaster transform . The number of studies included in the current meta-analysis meets the minimum recommended number of 17\u201320 studies . \n\nCoordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) was performed using the random-effects activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm  implemented in the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ) and Seed-based   d   Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) algorithm  implemented in the SDM-PSI 6.22 software ( ). Two different CBMA algorithms were used for the cross-method validation. \n\nThe ALE algorithm assesses the spatial convergence between neuroimaging studies by modelling spatial uncertainty of activation foci using isotropic three-dimensional Gaussian probability functions with the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) inversely related to the square root of the sample size of the original study . An ALE map is obtained by computing the union of activation probabilities across studies for each voxel and tested against a null distribution of random spatial convergence between studies . The empirical validations  showed that the optimal FWHM largely depends on the data and may be substantially larger than proposed in . The spatial smoothness of our fMRI data after preprocessing was 13.5\u00a0mm, as estimated by the SPM12 (Statistical parametric mapping) software package ( ). Since our objective was to find an overlap between the results of the meta-analysis and the Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data, we used an additional FWHM of 4\u00a0mm for the ALE meta-analysis. It allowed us to achieve a median kernel FWHM of 13.5\u00a0mm. We used a cluster-level extend threshold of 0.05 corrected for family-wise error (FWE) with an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold of 0.001 (5000 threshold permutations) recommended for the ALE analysis . \n\nThe alternative CBMA algorithm, SDM-PSI, considers not only the coordinates of the activation foci, but also the effect sizes. The SDM-PSI algorithm recreates 3D effect size images for each study using t-values of the peak coordinates and anisotropic kernels . It has been shown that the recreation substantially improved by fully anisotropic kernels and did not depend on the FWHM . We performed the SDM-PSI meta-analysis using the same coordinates as for the ALE meta-analysis adding peak t-values (z-values were converted to t-values). We used the default kernel (\u03b1\u2009=\u20091, FWHM\u2009=\u200920\u00a0mm) and threshold (threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 with 5000 permutations) recommended by SDM developers . \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nThe recruitment of subjects for the present fMRI study was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the sample size was 20 subjects (16 women, aged (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) 23.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6). To protect from the potential impact of relatively small sample size on the observed null-effects a retrospective power analysis was carried out, which suggested increasing the sample size up to 34 subjects. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 healthy, right-handed volunteer subjects (24 women, aged 25.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2). An Oldfield test was used to determine the dominant arm . The subject volunteers signed a written informed consent to participate in the study and were paid for their participation. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the N.P. Bechtereva Institute of the Human Brain of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n\n\n### Power analysis \n  \nTo perform power analysis, we used the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomic LA5c dataset  as it contains fMRI data from a relatively large cohort (N\u2009=\u2009115) of healthy subjects performing a stop-signal task (see \u201c \u201d for details). This classical inhibitory paradigm models a situation in which inhibitory brain activity is selectively triggered by infrequent inhibitory stimuli (stop signal) but not by Go stimuli . The mean effect sizes for the selective inhibition contrast (\u201cCorrect-Stop\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d contrast, see Fig.  ) were estimated within the cortical brain regions revealed by the current meta-analysis. They ranged from 0.57 to 1.12 Cohen\u2019s d. Power analysis was performed using GPower 3.1.9.7 . It indicated that the sample size of 34 subjects would be sufficient to detect the minimum expected selective inhibition effect (d\u2009=\u20090.57, two-tailed one-sample test, alpha\u2009=\u20090.05) with a power of 0.9 (see Fig.  ). The power of 0.8 or 0.9 is commonly used for sample size calculations . \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that obtaining non-significant results with high retrospective power (based on an independent dataset) or high prospective power would not provide direct evidence for the null hypothesis ). To provide evidence for the null hypothesis, Bayesian inference or frequentist equivalence testing should be used . Accordingly, in the current study, all conclusions on the non-selective response inhibition were made only on the basis of the Bayesian analysis and its overlap with the meta-analysis. Results for the classical NHST were added only to illustrate how the more familiar frequentist inference relates to Bayesian inference. \n\n\n### Experimental task and study procedure \n  \nWe used a paired stimulus modification of the Go\/NoGo task (see Fig.\u00a0 ) . This task was originally developed to dissociate cognitive processes, such as response inhibition, conflict monitoring, sensory mismatch and category discrimination . Given that imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented in an equiprobable manner this modification of the Go\/NoGo task was used for the purposes of the current study. Each trial consisted of the two consequently presented stimuli. The first preparatory cue stimulus warned the subjects on the presentation of the second, imperative stimulus, or indicated no need for any response to the second stimulus. The study included two variants of the experiment\u2019s instructions. According to the first instruction (see Fig.\u00a0 A), the subject should press the response button as soon as possible upon presentation of the pair of images \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A Go\u201d trials) and refrain from acting upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d trials). According to the instructions of the second experiment (see Fig.\u00a0 B), the subject acts after presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P Go\u201d trials) and suppresses an action upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d trials). The subjects were familiarized with the task just before scanning to ensure they understood the instructions. Additionally, before each fMRI session, the subjects were reminded of the need to react to Go stimuli as quickly as possible while refraining from reacting to NoGo stimuli.   \nExperimental design of the Go\/NoGo task. S1\u2014first stimulus (preparatory cue). S2\u2014second stimulus (imperative stimulus). A\u2014images of animals, P\u2014images of plants. (  A  ) First experiment: \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d. (  B  ) Second experiment: \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d. Red boxes highlight trials that were compared to test the hypothesis of selective and non-selective response inhibition. \n  \n\nIn both experiments, if the first stimulus presented was an image of a \u201cplant,\u201d subjects do not need to take any actions in response to the presentation of any second stimuli of a trial. In such a trial, the subject should ignore the second stimulus and wait for the next pair of stimuli (\u201cP-A Ignore\u201d and \u201cP-P Ignore\u201d trials). Accordingly, it was assumed that there is no inhibition of the prepared action in \u201cIgnore\u201d conditions. The \u201cIgnore\u201d trials were included in the adopted Go\/NoGo task to assess preparatory brain activity, such as preparing to receive a relevant stimulus (attentional set) and preparing to make a movement (motor set), by comparing them to Go and NoGo trials. However, the issue related to the preparatory processes is beyond the scope of the present study. Fifty pairs of each type of stimuli were randomly presented in each experiment. The order of following the instructions was counterbalanced among the subjects. Two variants of the present Go\/NoGo task allowed us to control the differences in the load on working memory between A-P\/A-A\u2013Go\/NoGo stimuli . \n\nThe fMRI data obtained using this experimental task allowed us to test the hypothesis on the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition in the current study, since a similar task design was previously used for the same purpose by Criaud et al. . The imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented after the preparatory stimulus with equal probability, as reported in event-related studies by . To build up prepotent tendency to react, subjects were instructed to press the button with their right thumb as quickly as possible. This is a case of a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and only one bit of information. It is known that these conditions elicit subthreshold automatic motor activations . According to G.A. Miller: \u201cOne bit of information is the amount of information that we need to make a decision between two equally likely alternatives\u201d . Here, it refers to discrimination between \u201canimal\u201d and \u201cplant\u201d stimuli. \n\nSuch an equally probable presentation of imperative stimuli provides several advantages. First, it minimizes the difference in cognitive load between Go and NoGo conditions arising from task complexity . Second, such a design enables the exclusion of effects associated with a low frequency of the NoGo stimuli presentation (\u201coddball\u201d effects) confounding the effect of inhibition . Third, it creates maximum uncertainty regarding the probability of the presentation of an imperative stimulus, thus minimizes the conflict between two response types, making it possible to distinguish between error monitoring and conflict resolution processes on the one hand and response inhibition processes on the other . \n\nIn total, 100 NoGo trials, 100 Go trials, 100 P-A Ignore trials, and 100 P-P Ignore trials were presented over two experimental sessions. In the absence of stimulation, a fixation cross was displayed in the centre of the screen. The stimuli were presented for 100\u00a0ms, and the interstimulus interval was 1000\u00a0ms. The intertrial interval jittered from 2800 to 3200\u00a0ms with an increment step of 100\u00a0ms. Additionally, to improve design efficiency, 100 zero events (fixation crosses) were randomly inserted between the stimuli pairs (trials), and their duration jittered from 3000 to 5000\u00a0ms with an increment size of 500\u00a0ms. The action to be performed consisted of pressing a button with the right thumb. The duration of one task session was 17.5\u00a0min. Before starting the fMRI study, the subjects performed a training task. The Invivo\u2019s Eloquence fMRI System (Invivo, Orlando, FL, USA) was used to deliver the stimuli, synchronize with fMRI acquisition, and record reaction times of subjects\u2019 bottom pressing. The task presentation sequence and all temporal parameters of the stimuli presentation were programmed using the E-prime 2.0 software package (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) was used for the study. The structural T1-images were registered with the following parameters: field of view (FOV)\u2014240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm, repetition time (TR)\u201425\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u20142.2\u00a0ms, 130 axial slices with a thickness of 1\u00a0mm and pixel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201430\u00b0. For the registration of T2*-images, a single-pulse echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used. The period of data registration from 31 axial slices was 2\u00a0s (TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200935\u00a0ms). The following parameters were employed: FOV\u2014200\u2009\u00d7\u2009186\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201490\u00b0, voxel size\u20143\u2009\u00d7\u20093x3 mm. Two dummy scans were performed prior to each session. To minimize head movements, we used an MR-compatible soft cervical collar and foam padding. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of fMRI images \n  \nImage preprocessing included the following: realignment to the first image of the session, slice time correction, co-registration, segmentation, normalization to an MNI template, and spatial smoothing (8\u00a0mm FWHM). Preprocessing and statistical analyses of the images were performed using an SPM12. To assess head motion during the scanning, we calculated the framewise displacement (FD) as the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the six realignment parameters . The mean FD across two runs ranged from 0.07 to 0.36\u00a0mm (group mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation was 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0mm). The average percentage of time points with FD over 0.9\u00a0mm was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092%. We used all time points for the analysis since all subjects had >\u200990% volumes under the FD threshold of 0.9\u00a0mm . \n\n\n### Lateralized BOLD response analysis \n  \nOne of the electrophysiological indicators of overt and covert motor activations is the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) . The equiprobable Go\/NoGo study by Hong et al.  showed an increase of the right-hand target-related LRP (\u201cC3 minus C4\u201d ERP difference) in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, which was considered as evidence of a prepotent response tendency. The fMRI analogue of LRP is the Lateralized BOLD response (LBR) . Therefore, we used the LBR to index prepotent motor activations under task settings of the present study. The right-hand LBR was calculated as the mean BOLD signal in the left sensorimotor cortex (SM) minus the right SM cortex (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference). BOLD signal was estimated within 0.5\u00a0s time bins from the target onset time using finite impulse response models (time window from 1 to 12\u00a0s). Regions of interest (ROIs) located in the SM cortex were defined as the overlap between anatomical and a priori functional masks . Functional masks were obtained using the Neurosynth platform for an automatic meta-analysis ( ). We used a uniformity test with a default false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p\u2009<\u20090.01 threshold for the \u201cmotor\u201d term (2565 studies). To obtain anatomical masks, we used voxels with the maximum probability for \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d and \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d labels according to the probabilistic Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas . ROI analysis was performed using one-sample and paired-sample t-tests with FDR correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of fMRI data \n  \nThe first level of analysis was conducted using frequentist parameter estimation. The second level of analysis was performed using both the frequentist and Bayesian parameter estimation . In general, using Bayesian analysis on the second level does not presuppose Bayesian parameter estimation at the first level of analysis. One can combine computationally less demanding frequentist parameter estimation for single subjects with Bayesian estimation and inference at the group level . Onset times of second stimuli presentation (separately for \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d, and also \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d), erroneous button pressing, and missing the responding in Go trials were used to create regressors of the general linear model (GLM) for each subject. Events were impulse responses with a duration of zero convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF). We also performed an additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives for all task regressors to take into account the unknown BOLD delay. Low-frequency drift was removed by temporal high-pass filtering with a cut-off frequency of 1\/128\u00a0Hz. Six head motion parameters were included in the GLM as nuisance regressors to account for the movement artefacts . Beta coefficients reflecting an increase in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the experimental condition relative to the implicit baseline were scaled to percent signal change (PSC) following the procedure recommended in [Ref. , p.186]. To this end, the beta coefficients for each condition were divided by the mean value of the beta coefficients for the constant term and multiplied by 100 and a scaling factor (SF) needed so that the peak of an isolated BOLD response is equal to one (SF\u2009=\u20090.21). Two linear contrasts of scaled beta coefficients were calculated: (1) 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d]\u20140.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]   (the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison);   (2) 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]\u20140.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d]   (the \u201cGo  \u2009+\u2009  NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison).   The sum of positive contrast weights was equal to one. The contrasts from 34 subjects were used as variables to verify the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition at the second level of analysis. Only grey matter voxels were included in the second-level analysis, as we did not expect to detect the BOLD signal changes in white matter associated with the Go\/NoGo task performance. To that end, a mask was created based on the segmentation of each subject\u2019s structural T1-images. \n\n\n### Verification of the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition \n  \nAs in previous studies employing equiprobable Go\/NoGo task with a single prepotent motor response, in the current study, non-selectivity refers to the perceptual decision mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination, or identification of sensory stimuli . In particular, we did not consider non-selectivity related to decision mechanisms that involve the selection between multiple alternative responses, which confound response inhibition processes in choice reaction time tasks . The former type of non-selectivity implies that any imperative stimuli (both Go and NoGo stimuli) would trigger response inhibition when the context is uncertain because of equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. The latter type of non-selectivity, usually called \u201cglobal\u201d inhibition, implies that inhibition affects all alternative responses, including the selected response . \n\nWe tested the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition using the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. In the case of the   selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a selective increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of NoGo stimuli compared to Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d). In the case of the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a practically equivalent increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of both NoGo and Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) in the brain areas related to the response inhibition, which were independently localized by the current meta-analysis (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d). Additionally, we used the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison to distinguish between the brain areas that are simply not activated in current task settings (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009=\u2009Ignore\u201d) from the brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, where no inhibition is required (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). Thus, to identify the non-selective response inhibition in the settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli, it was necessary to show a three-way overlap between (1) inhibitory-related brain areas according to the meta-analysis (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d), (2) brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) and (3) brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). This conjunction analysis was performed by binarization and multiplication of thresholded images . \n\nTo reveal brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d), one has to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. The classical NHST approach estimates the probability (p-value) of obtaining actual data\u2019s best-fitting parameter value,   \u03b2  , or something more extreme under the null hypothesis that the experimental effect is   \u03b8  \u2009=\u2009  c\u03b2  \u2009=\u2009  0.   The null hypothesis can never be accepted using NHST because the p-value does not represent the probability of the null hypothesis, and the probability that an effect equals exactly zero is itself zero . A non-significant result can be obtained in two cases : (1) there is no effect, and our data are against the alternative hypothesis; or (2) our data are insufficient to distinguish alternative hypothesis from the null hypothesis, and we cannot confidently make any inference (low statistical power). When the result obtained is not significant, it is recommended to use frequentist equivalence testing  or Bayesian inference  to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. In the present study, Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was used . \n\nThe Bayesian approach estimates the posterior probability   (PP)   distribution of the effect   \u03b8  , given the data using the likelihood and the prior knowledge. For the second-level Bayesian analysis, SPM12 implements the hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes approach with the global shrinkage prior . It represents a prior belief that, on average, in the whole brain, there is no global experimental effect. If the posterior probability of the effect exceeding the effect size threshold,   \u03b3,   is greater than the predefined probability threshold,   \u03b1  \u2009=\u200995%, then the hypothesis on the presence of \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted (see Fig.  A in the \u201c \u201d): \n\nIf the effect value falls within the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with a probability of   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.95, then the hypothesis of the null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted, supporting the practical equivalence  of the BOLD signal between the conditions compared (see Fig.  B): \n\nThe interval [\u2212\u2009  y  ;   y  ] can be thought of as the neuronal \u201cbackground noise level\u201d  or as a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) that expresses which effect size values (PSC) are equivalent to the null value for current practical purposes . \n\nThe hypothesis on the presence of the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect will be accepted if (see Fig.  C): \n\nIf none of the above criteria are satisfied, the data in particular voxel are insufficient to distinguish the null hypothesis from the alternative hypothesis (\u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, see Fig.  D) . For such voxels, it is impossible to make any inference confidently, so we need to increase the sample size or scanning time. In the current study, our conclusions were based only on voxels in which the effect size values (PSC) fell within or outside the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with the   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Thus, for these voxels, the data obtained are sufficient to make an inference confidently. This decision rule is also known as the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule [ ; see Fig.  ]. It was applied to the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparisons. BPI was performed using the   BayInf   toolbox based on SPM12 ( ) . BPI based on the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule with a zero-effect size threshold corresponds to the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons within the NHST framework . The group-level effect size threshold   \u03b3   was set at one standard deviation of the prior variance of the contrast (prior SD ), which is the default in SPM12 . Simulations showed that this threshold provides high sensitivity to both \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnot activated\u201d voxels while protecting against incorrect decisions . BPI with the ES threshold of one prior SD  typically detect similar \u201cactivations\u201d as classical NHST inference with a voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 . To illustrate this, the BPI results were compared with the classical NHST results. For visualization purposes, the posterior probabilities were converted to the logarithmic posterior odds, LogOdds\u2009=\u2009log(  PP  \/(1\u2009\u2212\u2009  PP  )). LogOdds\u2009>\u20093 correspond to   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Anatomical localization of clusters was identified using xjView toolbox ( ). \n\n\n### Sequential analyses \n  \nSince the statistical analysis was carried out twice, for the sample size N\u2009=\u200920 and N\u2009=\u200934, the question of \u201cdata peeking\u201d should be addressed. \u201cData peeking\u201d refers to the practice when a researcher periodically re-analyses sequentially obtained data and decides to stop data collection as soon as significant results are obtained . Sequential analyses and optional stopping in the classical NHST framework substantially inflate the number of false positives and require special adjustments of the p-values along with the definition of the stopping rule based on the power analysis . In contrast, Bayesian inference based on the posterior probabilities or Bayes factors does not depend on stopping intentions and does not necessarily require power analysis . Therefore, the issue of \u201cdata peeking\u201d may be mitigated by the usage of Bayesian statistics . \n\nWithin the classical NHST framework, a statistically significant difference may be shown in any voxel with a sufficiently large sample size, even when the effect is trivial or has no practical significance . Thus, with an unbounded increase of the data, the number of statistically significant voxels will approach 100% of the total number of voxels [see, for example ]. At the same time, Bayesian inference allows one to find not only \u201cactivated\u201d voxels but also \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels with a trivial difference (practical equivalence) and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for which obtained data are not sufficient. Increasing sample size using BPI will lead to the situation when the number of \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels reaches a plateau. When the plateau was reached, it is reasonable to stop the data collection. To illustrate how this relates to the current study, we provide an analysis of the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cactivated\u201d, \u201cnull effect,\u201d and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. To plot these dependencies, the analysis was performed for the samples from 6 to 34 subjects with a step of 2 subjects (see the \u201c \u201d). In total thirty random groups were sampled for each step. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \nAs a result of the ALE meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, we identified the brain structures that were characterized by increased neuronal activity demonstrated in settings of equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation compared to the control Go conditions (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks >\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast): (1) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), (2) right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), (4) bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula (also known as anterior insula\/frontal operculum (AIFO)), (5) right premotor cortex (PMC) and frontal eye field (FEF), (6) bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), and (7) bilateral thalamus (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The SDM-PSI results were generally consistent with the ALE results, with the only difference being the absence of clusters in the subcortex (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Therefore, below, we consider only clusters in the cerebral cortex.   \nResults of the ALE meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies using equal probability Go\/NoGo tasks (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). Figure was created using MRIcroGL 1.2.2 software ( ). \n    \nThe result of the ALE meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies using equal probability Go\/NoGo tasks (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). \n  \n DLPFC   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,   IFG   inferior frontal gyrus,   AIFO   anterior insula\/frontal operculum,   TPJ   temporoparietal junction,   SMA   supplementary motor area,   ACC   anterior cingulate cortex,   PMC   premotor cortex,   FEF   frontal eye field,   IPL   inferior parietal lobule. \n  \n\n\n### Behavioural data \n  \nIn two fMRI sessions, the mean response omission in Go trials was 2.97\u2009\u00b1\u20093.92%. The mean of false alarms in NoGo trials was 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64%. The mean response time (RT) was 384\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u00a0ms. \n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \nNeither classical NHST with the voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 nor Bayesian inference applied in the present fMRI study revealed a significant increase in the neuronal activity in NoGo trials compared to the Go trials. No significant increases were revealed using a less conservative threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 and a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of 0.005. Additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives also did not reveal a significant \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect predicted by the hypothesis of selective response inhibition. \n\nThe reversed \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast showed the expected motor activations in the pre- and postcentral gyrus, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, subcortical regions and cerebellum (see Fig.\u00a0  and Tables  , Tables   in the \u201c \u201d). Both statistical methods revealed similar activation patterns for the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.8), demonstrating the consistency between the BPI with   \u03b3  \u2009=\u20091 prior SD  and LogOdds\u2009>\u20093   (PP  \u2009>\u20090.95) thresholding approach and NHST with the voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05.   \nResults of classical voxel-wise and Bayesian parameter inference.

The \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect was not detected by any of the methods. Red colour depicts the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect.

White colour depicts (  A  ) non-significant voxels and (  B  ) \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels. Figure was created using Mango 4.1 software ( ). \n  \n\nAt the same time, Bayesian analysis has made it possible to define brain structures with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials. The null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect was revealed for a widely distributed set of regions throughout the entire brain surrounding clusters of activations revealed in the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast (see Fig.\u00a0 A). The \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d regions were separated from activation clusters by regions that consisted of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels . For \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, the data obtained are insufficient to accept or reject the null hypothesis. The number of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels were decreased with increasing sample size (see Fig.   in the \u201c \u201d). The largest gain in the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels can be noted from 6 to 20 subjects. After 20 subjects, the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels reached a plateau. This is also confirmed by the similarity between the BPI results for the sample size of 20 and 34 subjects (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.88 for the \"NoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\" effect, see also Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). \n\nIt should be noted that the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area cannot be reasonably split into several parts, such as activation clusters. Therefore, we limited ourselves to specifying the anatomic localization of brain areas where the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area overlaps with the clusters revealed by the current meta-analysis and brain areas activated by equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (see \u201c \u201d for the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d contrast in the \u201c \u201d, Fig.   and Table  ). \n\n\n### LBR analysis \n  \nThe right-hand LBRs were analysed to assess the prepotent motor tendency in equiprobable Go\/NoGo task settings. We did not find a significant increase in LBR above zero for the Ignore condition in any of the analysed time bins (see Table   in the \u201c \u201d). At the same time, we found a significant increase in LBR in the NoGo trials compared to the Ignore trials for time bins from 2.5 to 5.5\u00a0s (pFDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Therefore, the revealed increase in LBR supports the presence of prepotent motor activity in the NoGo trials (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nLBRs for the right hand (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference).

Figure was created using MRIcroGL 1.2.2 software ( ). \n  \n\n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nAs it can be inferred from the revealed overlap between the results of the ALE meta-analysis and the results of the abovementioned Bayesian analysis, only a few of the brain structures demonstrated (1) increased activity in the \u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d meta-analytical comparison, (2) the practical equivalence of the BOLD signal in the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison and (3) activation in Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials. Three-way overlap was observed in (1) right DLPFC, (2) right IPL, (3) right TPJ, (4) left IFG and anterior insula (AIFO), (5) right PMC, and FEF (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The results of the three-way overlap obtained using the SDM-PSI meta-analysis were generally consistent with the ALE overlap (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Two additional clusters were revealed using SDM-PSI meta-analysis: (1) left ACC\/preSMA (BA 32) and (2) right anterior insula. In the discussion, we considered only those clusters that were found in three-way overlaps for both meta-analyses.   \nThree-way overlap between the ALE meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis.

Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data provides evidence of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity evoked by Go and NoGo stimuli in several brain structures. According to the results of our meta-analysis, some of these brain structures, including the right DLPFC, IPL, and TPJ, the left IFG (AIFO), the right PMC, and FEF were associated with response inhibition. These structures were repeatedly found to be activated whenever the condition of equal probability presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli was compared with the control Go condition (\u201c50\/50% Go\/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). At the same time, we did not observe the selective response inhibition effect (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d) in the current study. This finding is consistent with the data of several previous event-related fMRI studies that did not find significant activity increase in NoGo trials compared to Go trials under similar experimental conditions , see also random-effects analysis within visual and audio modalities in . \n\nAn important question is whether we did not able to observe selective response inhibition due to insufficient inhibitory load in our task setting. Previously, it was argued that some configurations of the Go\/NoGo task may not reliably evoke prepotent motor activity and therefore their inhibition requirements are reduced . The argument for this was supported by fronto-central P300 amplitude reduction observed in the slow-paced (i.e. stimulus-stimulus interval\u2009>\u20094\u00a0s) equiprobable Go\/NoGo settings compared to settings with fast-paced rare NoGo trials. However, the study by Wessel  did not consider the cue-target type paradigms, aimed to increase the likelihood of a prepotent motor response, as in the current study. Equiprobable cue-target Go\/NoGo tasks have previously been successfully used to study prepotent response inhibition . Moreover, the Wessel study  considered fronto-central P300 as an index of inhibition of prepotent motor activity. However, some studies have suggested that the P300 component (and also the N200 component) is too late to explain the inhibition processes . It was argued that a marker of inhibitory control should exhibit activity that precedes inhibitory effects at the level of the motor cortex or the effector muscles (about 150\u00a0ms after inhibitory stimuli presentation, see . \n\nArguments on fast early inhibition were considered in a recent review by Diesburg and Wessel  developing the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model of motor inhibition in humans. This model was originally proposed by Schmidt and Berke  based on subcortical rodent recordings. It assumes that inhibition of motor responses is a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, any unexpected stimuli non-selectively and briefly delay or \u201cPause\u201d actions. The \u201cPause\u201d process has a global inhibitory effect on the motor system via the monosynaptic \u201chyperdirect\u201d pathway from the cortex to the subthalamic nucleus and is similar to the \u201cglobal inhibition\u201d concept proposed by Frank . In the second stage, if an unexpected stimulus is discriminated as inhibitory, a relatively slower inhibitory process fully \u201cCancels\u201d action via the \u201cindirect\u201d pathway. Therefore, the \u201cPause\u201d process \u201cbuys time\u201d for stimulus discrimination and decision making. According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model, the early transient suppression of corticospinal excitability and subthreshold EMG may be a reflection of the \u201cPause\u201d process. Although Diesburg and Wessel  have mainly focused on the stop-signal tasks, they also argued that their theoretical framework applies to motor inhibition in other paradigms, including the Go\/NoGo tasks. The authors posit that the \u201cPause\u201d process is part of a universal orienting response common to all salient, task-relevant events. This is in line with the hypothesis of the current study. When the context is uncertain because of the equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli, any imperative Go or NoGo stimuli may non-selectively trigger the inhibitory process. Conceptually this is similar to the \u201cPause\u201d process. \n\nThe presence of the prepotent response tendency in the current study was supported both by fast response times (\u2053\u2009380\u00a0ms) and increased LBR in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (fee Fig.\u00a0 ), in which no prepotent motor activity was expected. The former finding is closely match behavioural data from previous studies with similar equiprobable Go\/NoGo design, where subjects were trained to react as fast as possible to create prepotent response tendency . The later experimentally demonstrates the presence of covert prepotent motor activity in NoGo trials. \n\nThe other important question is how precisely observed activity can be associated with response inhibition per se in those brain regions in which the overlap was found between the meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis. It is well known that the frontoparietal structures (DLPFC, IPL, TPJ) are engaged not only in Go\/NoGo tasks but also in experiments examining task switching, resolution of cognitive conflicts, working memory, and attention focusing (\u201cmultiple demand system\u201d ; \u201ctask-general network\u201d ; \u201cextrinsic mode network\u201d . According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model the non-selective inhibitory process (\u201cPause\u201d) and attentional process may be indistinguishable, because attentional orienting to salient, task-related signals inherently accompanied by broad motor suppression . Both processes are so fast and transient that their neural signatures may be near impossible to disentangle. Furthermore, attentional and inhibitory processes may rely on overlapping neural circuits. \n\nHowever, several attempts have been made to dissociate inhibitory and attentional processes by using special modifications of Go\/NoGo task that control for attentional loads. For example, the fMRI study by Chikazoe et al.  showed greater activation to infrequent NoGo-stimuli than to infrequent Go-stimuli in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG). Since both NoGo and Go stimuli were infrequent, the authors associated pIFG activation with an inhibitory process. They also demonstrated attention-related activity in the right inferior frontal junction (anatomically close to pIFG) using infrequent Go stimuli vs. frequent Go stimuli contrast. The other fMRI study by Dodds et al.  showed activation in the right IFG to NoGo trials without attentional shifting compared to Go trials with attentional shifting. Reverse contrast revealed activation in the left inferior parietal cortex. The authors suggested that the right IFG and the left inferior parietal cortex are preferentially activated during response inhibition and attentional shifting, respectively. Dissimilar results have been observed in the fMRI study by Meffert et al. , which varied the frequency of Go and NoGo stimuli. They showed that the   left   IFG and dorsal pre-SMA were responsive to NoGo stimuli regardless of stimuli frequency. Meanwhile, a more ventral portion of pre-SMA and anterior insula showed greater activity to low frequency relative to higher frequency stimuli, regardless of response type. Finally, in the EEG studies by Hong et al.  and Hong et al.  the attention-related neural activity (P300 ERP and theta oscillations in the cingulate cortex) was dissociated from inhibitory-related activity by comparing between attended-NoGo and ignored-NoGo conditions. \n\nAt the same time, the most prominent feature of brain activity during Go\/NoGo tasks compared to diverse non-inhibitory tasks is a right-dominant activity in DLPFC [meta-analyses: ]. Among different response inhibition tasks, several meta-analyses showed that an action-restraint (Go\/NoGo task) elicits stronger activation in the right DLPFC and parietal cortex compared to another inhibition process, namely, action cancellation (stop-signal task) . Furthermore, the \u201cresponse uncertainty\u201d tasks induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli evoked more activity in the right DLPFC (near the cluster revealed in the current study with coordinates [x\u2009=\u200945 y\u2009=\u200933 z\u2009=\u200928], see Table  ) compared to Go\/NoGo and stop-signal tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli (\u201cresponse override\u201d tasks) . \n\nIn meta-analyses by Simmonds et al.  and Criaud and Boulinguez , it was supposed that the increased activity in the right DLPFC observed during Go\/NoGo tasks may be due to increased demands caused by working memory and attentional load rather than the inhibition processes per se. The authors explained this by the fact that most of the fMRI studies used complex designs. Therefore, it would be relatively more difficult to identify a NoGo stimulus, which is believed to increase the need for inhibitory control and consequently increase the brain inhibitory activity in NoGo trials. However, this confounding effect was controlled in the current fMRI study because we utilized a simple equiprobable Go\/NoGo task. \n\nAnother prefrontal structure related to the non-selective response inhibition in the current study was the left IFG (opercular part, AIFO). At the same time, the right IFG is commonly associated with response inhibition . Based on the study of patients with brain damage  and other neuroimaging studies using primarily the stop-signal tasks , it was claimed that the right IFG represents a key node of the response inhibition brain system. Currently, this opinion is under active discussion . It is noted that Aron et al.  predominantly relied upon studies using the stop-signal task and did not consider studies using Go\/NoGo tasks . Other studies revealed worse performance in the Go\/NoGo task when the left (not right) IFG was damaged . According to these findings, the left IFG can also participate in inhibitory control during action restraint, which is also confirmed by our results. \n\nRegarding the practically equivalent participation of PMC in both the Go and NoGo trials, it was previously shown to participate in the planning and coordination of actions because its electrical stimulation results in involuntary motor actions . According to Duque et al. , premotor cortex function is associated with inhibition of any premature actions and control of the time of action execution. The authors refer to this brain mechanism as \u201cimpulse control\u201d, a concept that is similar to the non-selective response inhibition . \n\nIn summary, it can be noted that the selectivity of response inhibition has been studied more extensively to date than its non-selectivity. A considerable amount of research on inhibitory control has used tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli. However, over time, it has become apparent that under several conditions, non-selectivity of response inhibition can, in principle, occur. Studies on non-selectivity of response inhibition typically focus on the possible brain mechanisms for non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) inhibition of motor responses in the settings of interference among multiple concurrent response options . Recently, Criaud et al.  supposed the possibility of involvement of non-selective response inhibition not only for NoGo stimuli but also for Go stimuli. In the current study, the practical equivalence of BOLD signals evoked by equiprobable NoGo and Go stimuli was demonstrated for a number of brain areas associated with response inhibition in an uncertain context, according to our meta-analysis. The present study results proved that response inhibition can act as a non-selective mechanism of action inhibition when the context is uncertain. Thus, one promising area of further research of brain mechanisms of response inhibition (and inhibitory control in general) is the study of the interplay between selective and non-selective inhibition as a function of the contextual uncertainty degree. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFor the first time, combining a meta-analysis and second-level Bayesian analysis yielded results favouring the existence of non-selective response inhibition in equiprobable Go\/NoGo task settings. In the present work, selectivity means that inhibition is triggered only by an inhibitory stimulus. The overlap between brain areas previously associated with response inhibition in uncertain context and brain areas demonstrating the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials was observed in the right DLPFC, IPL, TPJ, FEF, PMC, and left IFG (AIFO). When a subject was waiting for an equiprobable Go or NoGo stimulus, a non-selective inhibitory control process occurred in both Go trials and NoGo trials in opposition to the model of selective response inhibition. This type of response inhibition prevents the performance of any premature motor actions and operates in a non-selective, \u201cglobal\u201d mode. Its involvement is favoured by contextual uncertainty caused by the equally probable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. Presumably, upon the identification of a Go stimulus, the inhibition is released and the process of action execution is initiated, i.e., it acts as a gating mechanism for accessing a prepared motor program. At the same time, we do not discard the opportunity of involvement of selective inhibitory mechanisms in a less uncertain context. Therefore, future research should address the issue of how brain mechanisms of selective and non-selective response inhibition are inter-related. \n\n### Limitations and further considerations \n  \nGenerally, it is assumed that the non-selective response inhibition is a relatively early transient process. Therefore, one of the limitations is associated with a low temporal resolution of the fMRI method. Further studies of the early temporal dynamics of neural activity are needed using EEG, MEG, and intracranial recordings in similar uncertain context settings. In particular, evidence for the practical equivalence of early ERP amplitudes (170\u00a0ms) revealed previously in equiprobable NoGo and Go trials should be provided in a future research. It is also important to note that we looked for practically equivalent increases in regional brain activity as measured by BOLD-signal. Firstly, it is possible to look for the similarity of local activity patterns by employing multivariate classification techniques in future studies. Secondly, future research should consider how non-selective response inhibition is mediated by interactions between the revealed cortical structures and subcortical structures that form inhibitory and excitatory cortico-striato-thalamo cortical circuits. \n\nDespite the fact that revealed fast reaction times and the LBR increase in NoGo trials evidenced the existence of prepotent response tendency, the low error rate might be a potential limitation of the current study because of the high automaticity of induced behaviour. At the same time, such low commission error rates have been repeatedly reported in several equiprobable Go\/NoGo studies . Future research should use objective electrophysiological measures, such as LRPs, subthreshold electromyographic activity, and motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation to rigorously demonstrate prepotent motor activity in equiprobable cue-target Go\/NoGo task settings. \n\nThe other important challenge for the current study and the field in general is the question of segregation of the brain activity elicited by non-selective response inhibition from that elicited by non-inhibitory processes, like attentional or executive processes. One possible solution may be to look for brain activity that is causally related to inhibitory effects at the level of the primary motor cortex, spinal cord, and effector muscles. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9203582,"text_md5":"a525b7315c80fa7d96613f228ae28709","field_positions":{"authors":[0,85],"journal":[86,93],"publication_year":[95,99],"title":[110,248],"keywords":[262,299],"abstract":[312,2227],"body":[2236,62192]},"batch":2,"pmid":35710930,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-022-14221-x","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9203582","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9203582"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9203582\">9203582<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9203582  Evidence for non-selective response inhibition in uncertain contexts revealed by combined meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis of fMRI data"}
{"text":"Gavazzi, Gioele and Giovannelli, Fabio and Curr\u00f2, Tommaso and Mascalchi, Mario and Viggiano, Maria Pia\nBrain Imaging Behav, 2020\n\n# Title\n\nContiguity of proactive and reactive inhibitory brain areas: a cognitive model based on ALE meta-analyses\n\n# Keywords\n\nProactive inhibition\nCognitive control\nMeta-analysis\nRight inferior frontal Gyrus\nRight middle frontal Gyrus\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nCognitive control is a critical feature in adapting our behavior to environmental and internal demands with two types of inhibition having been identified, namely the proactive and the reactive. Aiming to shed light on their respective neural correlates, we decided to focus on the cerebral activity before or after presentation of the target demanding a subject\u2019s stop as a way to separate the proactive from the reactive components associated with the tasks. Accordingly, we performed three Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of fMRI studies exploring proactive and reactive inhibitory phases of cognitive control. For this purpose, we searched for fMRI studies investigating brain activity preceding or following target stimuli. Eight studies (291 subjects, 101 foci) were identified for the proactive analysis. Five of these studies and those previously analyzed by others (348 subjects, 199 foci) were meta-analyzed to explore the neural correlates of reactive inhibition. Overall, our results showed different networks for the two inhibitory components. Notably, we observed a contiguity between areas in the right inferior frontal gyrus pertaining to proactive inhibition and in the right middle frontal gyrus regarding reactive inhibition. These neural correlates allow proposal of a new comprehensive model of cognitive control. \n \n\n# Body\n \nHigh order processes such as decision making involve adaptive and flexible cognitive control. This adaptability provides the resources to modify planned responses and to appropriately react to ever-changing information from external stimuli and internal goals (Duque et al.  ). \n\nCognitive control operates through two inhibition mechanisms\u2014proactive and reactive modes\u2014depending on the time the action is withheld. \n\nProactive inhibition may lead to specific response tendencies and concerns the process of preparing actions to achieve a current target by facilitating, if necessary, the suppression of the impending action (Aron  ). The proactive process is a \u2018top-down\u2019 form of control: by intervening before event occurrence, it enhances accuracy and efficiency of the motor response (Braver  ). Reactive inhibition is a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 form and it is thought to be a \u201ccut-trigger\u201d stopping of an already initiated motor response (Meyer and Bucci  ). Although both processes play a fundamental role in cognitive control to prevent maladaptive behaviours (Gazzaniga et al.  ), the nature of their respective relationship remains a long-standing unanswered question. \n\nSome studies on cognitive control have addressed the relationship between proactive and reactive mechanisms assuming a differential recruitment reflecting external demands. Other studies have viewed the two processes as opposite poles on a continuum (Chiew and Braver  ). Admittedly, a general limitation of these studies is the difficulty to design paradigms capable of directly untangling the two processes. \n\nAs a consequence, knowledge regarding the neuroanatomical correlates of the two inhibitory processes is unbalanced. Indeed, although the ability to anticipate future events is the basis of any behavior, human behavior has been explained by investigating mainly reactive functions and their underpinning neural networks (see Bari and Robbins   and Aron et al.   for review). \n\nExperimental evidence supports the view that the reactive inhibition process recruits a right-lateralized fronto-parietal circuit (e.g. Corbetta et al.  ). In one such example, Simmonds et al. ( ) conducted a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies to evaluate the brain areas involved in reactive control by gathering results from ten investigations that implemented a Go\/No-go task during fMRI acquisitions. The studies were divided into two groups: \u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d, depending on the working memory task demand. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed that right-lateralized prefrontal-parietal circuits were observed only in complex tasks, whereas the pre supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) was involved in response inhibition regardless of tasks complexity. \n\nConversely, limited literature is currently available on brain substrates of the proactive phase of inhibition, and no meta-analyses have considered neuroimaging studies. Proactive inhibition has recently been configured as a default modality of executive control, mediated by a sort of \u201cbraking-accelerator system\u201d (Aron  ; Criaud et al.  ). More precisely, the top-down control (accelerator) would consist in a temporary release (braking) of the inhibitory default state of our motor system. Proactive inhibition seems to rely on a wide network that includes the pre-SMA, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and the striatum (Cai et al.  ; Aron et al.  ), the prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal cortex (Jaffard et al.  ) and the primary motor cortex (Claffey et al.  ; Sinclair and Hammond  ). \n\nAs a matter fact, converging evidence shows that regions recruited both in proactive and reactive inhibition processes partially overlap (Chikazoe et al.  ; Zandbelt and Vink  ; Zandbelt et al.  ; van Belle et al.  ). These shared brain activations may hypothetically depend on intrinsic constraints of tasks that appear not well-suited for differentiating the two processes (Meyer and Bucci  ). On the other hand, the overlapping activations might reflect functional or network sharing between the two inhibitory processes (Best et al.  ). In an attempt to rule out intrinsic limits of behavioural tasks, we explored the two distinct phases of the inhibitory processes, assuming that volumes following a stimulus-triggering response correspond to the reactive phase, whereas the volumes preceding the stimulus are related to the proactive phase. \n\nFor this purpose, we conducted a meta-analysis, gathering data from studies which implemented fMRI data during behavioural tasks commonly employed to assess inhibitory processes (e.g. Stop Signal Task and the Go\/No-go task). Admittedly, the double nature of these tasks does not help separate involvement of the two components from each other. However, by focusing exclusively on the timing of the cerebral activity (acquired volumes), i.e. before or following presentation of the target demanding the subject\u2019s stop, separation of the proactive from the reactive components associated with the tasks would be possible. For the sake of completeness, we also included data originally collected by Simmonds et al. ( ) to account for differences due to technical and statistical updating of the ALE algorithm. \n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Literature search and selection \n  \nWe conducted a systematic and comprehensive literature search to select fMRI studies published up to January 2019 using the databases   PubMed   ( ) and   Web of Science   ( ). The selected keywords were combined using the Boolean operator AND and OR. The   PubMed   search input was: ((((proactive control) OR proactive inhibition) OR alerting) OR readiness) AND fMRI. The   Web of Science   search input was: TS\u2009=\u2009((proactive control OR proactive inhibition OR alerting OR readiness) AND fMRI). Additional studies were searched from the references of all identified publications. Eligibility was determined by a two-step procedure performed by three of the authors (GG, FG, and TC). First, the titles and abstracts of all identified articles were screened. In the second step, the full texts of studies, according to predefined eligibility criteria, were independently examined and agreement was reached after discussion. Our study was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.  ) (PRISMA checklist is provided in the Appendices Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). \n\nThe studies were included for the quantitative analyses if they met the following criteria: 1) whole-brain analysis performed on fMRI data (we excluded studies conducted by positron emission tomography and fMRI studies in which only results from ROI analysis were reported); 2) availability of coordinates of activation foci clearly provided either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space; 3) availability of data related to the brain activity preceding a target stimulus (e.g. Go or No-go - defined as proactive, preparatory, warning, or readiness period); 4) availability of studies conducted on healthy participants reporting contrasts against rest or baseline. We excluded studies that used the go trials or other contrast conditions as baseline in the proactive phase. The selection of these strict criteria allowed us to select homogeneous studies in order to obtain theoretically more robust measures (Borenstein et al.  ). \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis (Turkeltaub et al.  ,  ; Laird et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ) was performed using GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ). Neuroanatomical coordinates reported in MNI space were transformed to Talairach space (Talairach\u00a0et al.  ). \n\nALE is a coordinate-based meta-analysis technique that uses peak coordinates reported in functional studies as input. The description of the exact procedure of ALE meta-analyses can be found in several methodological papers (Eickhoff et al.  ,  ) and herein we shall only summarize it. Controlling for the sample size, the ALE algorithm evaluates the convergence of activation foci from different neuroimaging studies, modeled as probability distributions of activation (Eickhoff et al.  ) at given coordinates, against null distributions of random spatial associations between studies. Data were elaborated with the non-additive algorithm, described in Turkeltaub et al. ( ), to minimize within-experiment effects. Inference was made at cluster-level, as this procedure yields the better balance between sensitivity and specificity (Eickhoff et al.  ) as compared to other methods. The cluster forming threshold was set at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.005 (uncorrected at the voxel-level) and the size of the resulting supra-threshold clusters was compared (applying a threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05) to a null distribution of cluster sizes determined by 1000 permutations of the data. \n\n\n### Appendix 1 details the studies we selected \n  \nThe first meta-analysis was conducted in order to include the activation foci generated in the contrasts associated with the volume preceding the stimulus against the baseline (Proactive Process). The second one included the activation foci generated in the contrasts associated to the volume following the stimulus against the baseline (Reactive Process: Nogo-Baseline) of our studies cumulated with those reported by Simmonds et al. ( ). The overlap among these two types of inhibition was analyzed by performing a conjunction analysis across the two processes. The differences in activation in the two inhibitory domains were identified by pairwise subtraction analyses (Eickhoff et al.  ). We employed a statistical threshold of uncorrected   p  \u00a0<\u20090.01 with 10,000 permutations and a cluster-size threshold of 200\u00a0mm3. \n\nIn the last analysis we rerun the data collected by Simmonds et al. ( ) dealing with the reactive process, that is, the foci generated in the contrasts associated to the volume following the stimulus against the baseline (\u201cNogo-Baseline\u201d), using the algorithm adopted for the two above meta-analyses. In particular, in all meta-analyses we defined as baseline the activation measured from the volumes acquired in the rest time interval at the end of each trial. \n\nWhole-brain maps of the thresholded ALE images were visualized in Mango V.4.0.1 ( ) which is an anatomical image overlay program, and superimposed onto a standardized anatomical template in Talairach space. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur search yielded 73 potentially eligible studies (the flow chart regarding article selection is illustrated in Appendices Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). After full-text assessment of these articles, we excluded studies not designed to evaluate the proactive component, studies reporting only ROI analysis results, and studies employing behavioral tasks aimed to assess conflict. Hence eight studies published from 2008 to 2018 were included in the quantitative analysis. From these eight studies, a cumulative number of 291 healthy subjects and 101 foci resulted. \n\nOnly five of the eight studies matched the same criteria adopted by Simmonds et al. ( ) to explore the reactive inhibitory component. Therefore, we included in the quantitative analysis those five studies resulting from our selection and the eleven studies previously gathered by Simmonds et al. ( ) for a total number of 348 healthy subjects and 199 foci. The main characteristics of the studies meta-analyzed are reported in Appendix Table  . \n\nIn a separate quantitative analysis we also included the original eleven studies performed between 2000 and 2004 that were previously meta-analyzed by Simmonds et al. ( ) with a cumulative number of 212 healthy subjects and 140 foci on the reactive inhibitory phase alone. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis of the proactive inhibitory phase (Fig.\u00a0 ) identified the largest size cluster (3064\u00a0mm^3) in the right insula with extension to the r-IFG, followed by the cluster in the left insula (1888\u00a0mm^3), the cluster in the right thalamus (1440\u00a0mm^3), and the cluster encompassing bilaterally the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC - 1120\u00a0mm^3).   \n ALE meta-analysis map for the Proactive and Reactive Inhibition process of our data selection.   The algorithm converged for Proactive process (in yellow-red) on right Insula (Ins) and extended to rIFG, left Ins, right Thalamus (Th) and bilaterally the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC).

Another cluster (1856\u00a0mm^3) was included in the right insula and a last cluster (1712\u00a0mm^3) in the medial frontal gyrus (Tab  , Fig.  ).   \n Results from ALE meta-analysis.

Direct contrast between proactive and reactive inhibitory phases revealed higher convergence of activity for the reactive inhibition (as shown in white-green in Fig.  ) in the r-MFG (1672\u00a0mm^3).   \n Conjunction and subtraction analyses of Proactive and Reactive Inhibitory process.

So far, all meta-analyses exploring with neuroimaging the neural correlates of inhibitory processes have been conducted on the reactive inhibitory phase. The present work reports for the first time a meta-analysis carried out by gathering data from studies that explored both the proactive and reactive components, mainly the Stop Signal Task (SST) and the Go\/No-go task acquired during fMRI. The ALE meta-analysis of foci associated with the proactive inhibition phase showed significant convergence of activation in bilateral ACC and insulae, the rIFG and right thalamus. \n\nAs previously reported in studies on proactive inhibition (Kinomura et al.  ; Yanaka et al.  ; Gavazzi et al.  ,  ) insulae could absolve functions associated with the alerting and salience processes (Taylor et al.  ; Eckert et al.  ). Along this line, also involvement of the right thalamus is consistent with the view that an alerting process is necessary to keep proactive inhibition engaged. In fact, the intra-thalamic nuclei are engaged to maintain a state of high vigilance or alerting (Kinomura et al.  ; Yanaka et al.  ). On the other hand, there is neuroimaging and neuropsychological convergence evidence that suggests rIFG plays a pivotal role in inhibitory processes across a range of tasks, requiring suppression of response tendencies (Aron et al.  ,  ). \n\nThe ACC may ultimately be the key region in the proactive network. Indeed, the ACC is ideally suited as a crucial brain region for switching the proactive inhibitory modality into the reactive inhibitory control. In fact, many studies have shown that ACC monitors the information from incoming external stimuli in search of conflicts (Bari and Robbins  ; Botvinick et al.  ), rather than resolving them (Kerns  ; Botvinick et al.  ). Moreover, a nonparametric voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping performed in a large sample of patients with focal brain lesions (Glascher et al.  ) supports the view that the key function of the ACC (particularly the rostral part) may be set shifting, whereas other regions including the right pre-frontal cortex may be involved in error detection as well as inhibitory functions. \n\nProactive inhibition has been considered a default modality of executive control, mediated by a sort of \u2018braking-accelerator system\u2019 (Criaud et al.  ). In a similar way, the insulae with the right thalamus and the r-IFG could represent the core of the proactive inhibitory network operating in a continuous balance between the inhibitory component, exerted by the r-IGF, and the excitatory component engaging the insulae and the thalamus (part of the alertness network). The shift from proactive to reactive inhibitory status would thus be determined by recruitment of the ACC. In this network, the ACC would allow income of external stimuli, evaluation of their saliency, and maintenance of information online. Notably, several studies support communication between the cerebral regions characterizing the braking-accelerator system (insulae, right thalamus and r-IFG) and the ACC. Cai et al. ( ) documented a functional connectivity between the ACC and right anterior insula, representing a node of a system that facilitates detection and attention to salient events (Seeley et al.  ; Menon and Uddin  ). In particular, the right anterior Insula would have the role of detecting potentially or behaviorally significant events, whereas the ACC would update internal attention settings in response to those events (Han et al.  ). \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis we performed on data related to the reactive inhibition phase in the same studies exploited for proactive inhibition along with those gathered by Simmonds et al. ( ) showed significant convergence of activation in the r-MFG, medial\/superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, insula and in the left precentral gyrus. Interestingly, when we repeated the ALE meta-analysis with the updated ALE algorithm of the foci associated with the reactive inhibition phase of the data collected by Simmonds et al. ( ), significant convergence of activation in right middle frontal gyrus, right putamen, left fusiform gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule emerged. Thus, only r-MFG was consistent between the two meta-analyses (Fig.  ). This is noteworthy since we followed the same criteria as Simmonds et al. ( ) to select the data to be analyzed, with the updated algorithm being the only difference between the two analyses. In their original analysis of reactive inhibition foci (see Appendix Table  ), Simmonds et al. ( ) observed the pre-SMA, right pre-frontal regions, (r-IFG and r-MFG) left pre-motor cortex, bilateral inferior parietal regions, insulae, putamen and occipital regions. \n\nThus, our re-analysis allows us to address two main points. \n\nFirst, both phases of inhibitory control (proactive and reactive) were included in the list of brain regions reported by Simmonds et al. ( ), although their meta-analysis was based exclusively on reactive inhibition (namely, volumes following the stimulus). In particular, by comparing our results (pre-stimulus and post-stimulus volumes) with those reported by Simmonds et al. ( ) it becomes possible to map the brain networks involved in the two components of the inhibitory process. Except for the ACC and right thalamus, all brain regions revealed by the studies we selected are almost comprised in those (see Appendix Table  ) reported by Simmonds et al. ( ). Such discrepancies would suggest that insulae and r-IFG, which we observed only in the proactive inhibitory process, may have been reported in the reactive process by Simmonds et al. ( ) due to methodological and statistical parameters differences. Indeed, several studies have shown how previous ALE algorithms were prone to statistical error type I (e.g. Eickhoff et al.  ), leading to false positive results. However, this mismatch could result from the higher type I error ratio of the decade-old algorithm in ALE meta-analyses and\/or the improved mapping of BOLD signal over the last ten years (we included studies after 2008). Future investigations are necessary to address this point. \n\nSecond, r-MFG was the only region related to the reactive process to consistently emerge among the meta-analyses conducted in the present study, in particular considering the contrast between the reactive and the proactive inhibition (Fig.  ). Differently, according to the interpretation by Simmonds et al. ( ), pre-SMA plays a primary reactive role regardless of task complexity. Indeed, pre-SMA has been reported as involved in interrupting an ongoing action (Swann et al.  ; Picazio et al.  ), whereas r-IFG seems to play an extensive role in inhibitory functioning (Aron et al.  ,  ). This latter has been corroborated by Gavazzi et al. ( ) who described a patient with damage to almost the entire right hemisphere during puberty who subsequently recovered, or preserved, her inhibitory functions by engaging the left homotopic IFG region exclusively, but not the pre-SMA. \n\nOverall, our analyses make it possible to spatially differentiate areas involved in proactive and reactive components of inhibition which formerly were assigned to a single network (see Appendix Table  ). Notably, we have shown that the inhibitory component involved in proactive processes mainly recruits the r-IFG, whereas the inhibitory component employed in reactive processes exclusively engages the r-MFG. \n\nThe anatomical contiguity of the two cortical regions involved in different phases (r-IFG for proactive and r-MFG for reactive) of the inhibitory control is in line with the distributed nature of the brain systems associated with the higher functions in mammals (Fig.\u00a0 ). This distributed nature may be associated, on the one hand, with connections between cortical association areas in the transverse cortical dimension, and, on the other hand with the columnar organization of the neocortex (e.g. Mountcastle  ) that underpins the reciprocal linkage between cortical and subcortical structures. For example, columnar organization has been demonstrated in the frontal association cortex, namely Brodmann areas 46 and 9, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (see Petrides  ).   \n Contiguity in right pre-frontal cortex between proactive (r-IFG) and reactive (r-MFG) inhibitory processes. a   - Foci meeting criteria for inclusion in the metanalysis of proactive (red sphere) and reactive (green sphere) inhibitory processes. Each foci is represented by a sphere with size proportional to the number of subjects enrolled in the study. From top to down, the two dotted white lines identify the r-MFG and the r-IFG brain regions, respectively.   b   - This panel illustrates the Excitatory, Inhibitory and Switch components of the P-R M. According to the model the excitatory component would be exerted by the thalamus and both Insulae, whereas the inhibitory component would recruit the r-IFG and the r-MFG for the proactive and reactive inhibitory processes, respectively. The ACC would play the role of the switch component turning the proactive network into the reactive one \n    \nPRISMA flow chart of study selection \n  \n\nThe right inferior cortices and pre-SMA are traditionally considered key structures in the inhibitory component of cognitive control (e.g. Aron et al.  ). According to our results, it seems that we might re-define the roles of these structures. \n\nAs we observed the r-IFG only in the proactive network, but neither in the reactive network nor in the shared network between proactive and reactive phases, this region might be viewed as a precursor of the reactive inhibitory process. Accordingly, the fact that several studies in human patients with damaged r-IFG justified attribution of the r-IFG to inhibitory control, it is not per se inconsistent with a hierarchically earlier\/higher role in the general inhibitory process of this area. Moreover, our results confirm that the right middle frontal gyrus belongs entirely to the reactive inhibitory network. \n\nOn the basis of neural correlates revealed by our meta-analyses, we propose a new cognitive model to describe motor inhibitory processes (see Fig.  ) which we have called the Proactive-Reactive Model (P-R M). \n\nCognitive control of our actions relies on proactive and reactive phases that operate in synergy, optimizing environmental interactions. In our view, the proactive process is based on an Excitatory, an Inhibitory and a Switch component (See Fig.  ). The Excitatory component requires thalamus and insulae activations (as discussed above), whereas r-IFG would play the role of an Inhibitory component in order to balance the forces. For its specific functions, the ACC may play the role of the Switch component, turning the reactive phase into a proactive one. In fact, ACC does not only form a communication node for saliency with the right insula and borders with r-MFG, but it also is the key region in monitoring and selecting conflictual stimuli coming from the external world (e.g. MacDonald  ). Notably ACC and the right insula are the only brain regions belonging both to proactive and reactive networks (Fig.  ). Therefore, as the main brain region capable of absolving all these functions, ACC is a good candidate for the role of Switch component. The reactive phase, on the other hand, seems to be controlled by r-MFG which in turn, depending on the specific request of the external environment (or the task in an experimental setting), recruits the necessary additional areas. This would explain why the r-MFG is exclusively and consistently found in all analyses focused on the reactive phase. Notably, in the re-run of the Simmonds et al. ( ) metanalysis, we did not find pre-SMA as a part of the inhibitory reactive network. However in light of the considerable literature supporting its involvement in reactive inhibition, we submit that this brain region absolves the specific function to stop the action. Indeed, pre-SMA is often reported in studies where the system is highly stressed, for instance those employing the Stop Signal Task, but rarely in Go\/No-go protocols (see studies reported in Appendix Table  ). \n\nImportantly, as mentioned above, the contiguity between r-IFG and r-MFG and their shared columnar organization strongly support the idea that the core of inhibitory component of the model resides in these two regions with common cytoarchitecture, whereas pre-SMA, having a different cytoarchitecture and being also nearer to the motor areas, seems to be more engaged in sending the motor command of stop. In other words, according to our model the inferior frontal cortices would communicate with the ACC both in proactive (r-IFG) and reactive (r-MFG) phases in order to evaluate when, and if, to inhibit an action. Consistently with other works (Swann et al.  ; Picazio et al.  ), the role of pre-SMA would be limited to providing the actual stop of motor commands. \n\nBy meta-analyzing neural correlates reported in task-based fMRI studies we propose a new model of cognitive control. Since all studies selected were based on fMRI protocols, we are aware that the accuracy of our results might be influenced by the low temporal resolution of this instrument. This is the main limitation of the present work. In particular, we recognize that the hypothesized role of switch we attributed to the ACC being temporally brief and spread between the proactive and reactive phases needs to be evaluated by further investigations. Different techniques with improved temporal resolution as compared to fMRI, like MEG and\/or the combination of EEG-fMRI, might be used for this purpose with an exploration at higher temporal resolution by means of additional parameters of the BOLD contrast and beyond. With these methods one may verify the model proposed here as well as validate and potentially detail the mechanism of the ACC. \n\nMoreover, on clinical grounds, a separate analysis of the proactive and reactive components in future fMRI studies might increase our understanding of addictive behaviors in psychiatric conditions and of the physiopathological mechanisms underlying loss of cognitive control in neurodegenerative or infective diseases predominantly affecting the frontal and cingulate cortices. These include, on the one hand, fronto-temporal dementia, Huntington chorea, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and, on the other hand, Herpes Encephalitis. The same approach might be pursued in vascular or inflammatory diseases involving the subcortical white matter as in small vessel diseases or multiple sclerosis. Finally, useful information could be gathered in cases of infarct in the territory of the anterior cerebral arteries which typically includes the ACC. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe designed and performed meta-analyses on proactive and reactive inhibition by mirroring and replicating the study on reactive inhibition conducted a decade ago by Simmonds et al. ( ). We analyzed exclusively studies contrasting pre-stimulus volumes to explore proactive inhibition and post-stimulus volumes to investigate reactive inhibition brain regions. Our results have shown almost completely different networks for proactive and reactive processes and have allowed us to re-define the role of brain regions in the right frontal cortex. Based on these findings, we propose the P-R Model of cognitive control of actions, which has a proactive phase based on an excitatory component exerted by insulae and red thalamus balanced by an inhibitory component driven by the r-IFG. The shift of a proactive into a reactive phase would involve the ACC which operates as a sort of switch by analyzing external information and communicating with the right prefrontal cortices (namely r-IFG and r-MFG). Finally, the reactive phase would critically involve r-MFG which, depending on the specific task, would activate pre-SMA in order to stop actions. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8413163,"text_md5":"9c19e65f4bf5b9c0341b91c7793f6f97","field_positions":{"authors":[0,102],"journal":[103,122],"publication_year":[124,128],"title":[139,244],"keywords":[258,367],"abstract":[380,1740],"body":[1749,33021]},"batch":2,"pmid":32748318,"doi":"10.1007\/s11682-020-00369-5","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8413163","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8413163"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8413163\">8413163<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8413163  Contiguity of proactive and reactive inhibitory brain areas: a cognitive model based on ALE meta-analyses"}
{"text":"Qing, Xiuli and Gu, Li and Li, Dehua\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nAbnormalities of Localized Connectivity in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Voxel-Wise Meta-Analysis\n\n# Keywords\n\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\nlocalized connectivity\nregional homogeneity\nmeta-analysis\nseed-based d mapping\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n Background:   A large amount of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have revealed abnormalities of regional homogeneity (ReHo, an index of localized intraregional connectivity) in the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the past few decades, However, the findings of these ReHo studies have remained inconsistent. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the concurrence across ReHo studies for clarifying the most consistent localized connectivity underpinning this disorder. \n\n Methods:   A systematic review of online databases was conducted for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies comparing ReHo between OCD patients and healthy control subjects (HCS). Anisotropic effect size version of the seed-based d mapping, a voxel-wise meta-analytic approach, was adopted to explore regions of abnormal ReHo alterations in OCD patients relative to HCS. Additionally, meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the potential effects of clinical features on the reported ReHo abnormalities. \n\n Results:   Ten datasets comprising 359 OCD patients and 361 HCS were included. Compared with HCS, patients with OCD showed higher ReHo in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Meanwhile, lower ReHo was identified in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral cerebellum in OCD patients. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the ReHo in the OFC was negatively correlated with illness duration in OCD patients. \n\n Conclusions:   Our meta-analysis gave a quantitative overview of ReHo findings in OCD and demonstrated that the most consistent localized connectivity abnormalities in individuals with OCD are in the prefrontal cortex. Meanwhile, our findings provided evidence that the hypo-activation of SMA and cerebellum might be associated with the pathophysiology of OCD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a common mental illness characterized persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and\/or ritualized repetitive behaviors (compulsions) (Stein et al.,  ), has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2 to 3% (Ruscio et al.,  ). OCD usually has an onset in childhood and turns into a chronic course (Ruscio et al.,  ). Despite its high disability rate and the resultant social burden, the neuropathology of OCD is still not fully understood. Thus, identifying the neural correlates of OCD is of paramount significance to elevate the diagnostic specificity and improve the treatment efficacy of this disorder. \n\nThe development of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and neuroimage analytical approaches have greatly advanced our understanding of the neurobiological substrates regarding OCD in the past few decades (Dougherty et al.,  ). Previous structural MRI meta- and meta- analytical publications have indicated the key role of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) network in the pathophysiology of OCD (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ; Rotge et al.,  ; de Wit et al.,  ; Fouche et al.,  ; Hu et al.,  ). Meanwhile, it is reported that multiple phenotypic subtypes of OCD might have different structural neural substrates (Dougherty et al.,  ). For example, Hirose et al. found a negative association between washing symptom dimension score and the right thalamic gray matter as well as a significant negative correlation between hoarding symptom dimension score and the left angular white matter in OCD patients (Hirose et al.,  ). In terms of the functional MRI (fMRI) researches in OCD, the results appear to be highly heterogeneous. For example, patients with OCD showed abnormal activation of mesolimbic and ventral striatal circuitry during reward-based spatial learning (Marsh et al.,  ). One experiment testing the error monitoring function revealed hyperactivation of the right amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in OCD patients compared with healthy control subjects (HCS) (Grutzmann et al.,  ). Another fMRI study examining decision making function found that OCD patients showed hypo-activation in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex (Norman et al.,  ). The discrepancies between these fMRI studies might be attributed to sample size, clinical heterogeneity (such as medication strategies and comorbidity profiles) and experimental paradigm, which dramatically affected the fMRI findings. \n\nRather than traditional task-based fMRI, the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a commonly used neuroimaging approach to explore the brain function alterations in normal and disease states without performing any task (Biswal,  ). The amplitude low-frequency Puctuation (ALFF) is a commonly used rs-fMRI parameter that could provide information of regional activation of brain (Fox and Raichle,  ) while an improved measure named fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) has been put forward as a normalized version of ALFF (Zou et al.,  ). Previous investigations have demonstrated alterations of (f)ALFF in a range of brain regions including the classical CSTC circuits and some newly found brain areas such as the parietal lobe, temporal lobe and the cerebellum (Hou et al.,  ; Fan et al.,  ; Gimenez et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ). Besides the (f)ALFF, functional connectivity (FC), a valid rs-fMRI index reflecting the level of integration of local activity across brain regions (Buckner et al.,  ), has been widely adopted to investigate the neural pathogenesis of OCD (Gursel et al.,  ). Previous FC studies have identified that, besides the classical CSTC circuitry, the between-network hypoconnectivity of triple-network (salience, frontoparietal and default-mode networks) might also get involved in the psychopathology in OCD (Gursel et al.,  ). Though explorations of network-level neural function abnormalities in OCD have achieved remarkable progress, the local neural dysfunction of this disorder received less attention. \n\nRegional Homogeneity (ReHo), a rs-fMRI parameter characterizing the local synchronization of spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuation among neighboring voxels within a given cluster, offered new chance to investigate the localized connectivity disruptions in patients without a priori constraints (Zang et al.,  ). A large amount of rs-fMRI studies have revealed abnormalities of ReHo in OCD, However, the findings of these ReHo studies have remained inconsistent and controversial. For example, one study reported that OCD patients exhibited higher ReHo in the right cerebellum (Ping et al.,  ) while another study identified lower ReHo in the bilateral cerebellum of OCD patients (Hu et al.,  ). Thus, it was necessary to perform a quantitative overview of ReHo findings in OCD. \n\nTo our knowledge, Hao et al. published a meta-analysis concerning ReHo alterations in OCD via seed-based d mapping (SDM) approach (Hao et al.,  ). Nevertheless, there were two major shortcomings in their study. First, according to SDM designers' suggestion, the minimum of 10 studies was recommended for SDM meta-analyses (Carlisi et al.,  ; Muller et al.,  ). However, only eight datasets were included in their meta-analysis (Hao et al.,  ). Second, Hao et al. did not to evaluate the association between the clinical variables and ReHo alterations because the included studies were too few (less than 9 studies) to perform meta-regression analysis (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). Therefore, we conducted an updated voxel wise meta-analysis to identify the most robust ReHo abnormalities in OCD patients compared with the controls using the Anisotropic effect size version of the seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM). This new version of SDM method has several advantages such as: (i) avoiding any voxel appearing significant in opposite directions; (ii) reconstructing both positive and negative differences in the same signed differential map; (iii) combining the reported peak coordinates with statistical parametric maps. Additionally, we performed meta-regression to explore the potential effects of clinical features on reported ReHo alterations. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Data Source \n  \nSystematic searches of the online database including PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science (from January 2000 to December 2020) were conducted. The keyword searches were performed using the following terms: (\u201cobsessive-compulsive disorder\u201d or \u201cOCD\u201d) plus (\u201cresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201crs-fMRI\u201d) or (\u201cregional homogeneity\u201d or \u201c ReHo\u201d) or (\u201clocalized connectivity\u201d). We also screened the reference lists of relevant articles in order to obtain additional literature. \n\n\n### Studies Selection and Data Extraction \n  \nA study was considered for inclusion if it (i) was a research paper and published in English; (ii) reported ReHo comparison between patients with OCD and HCS; (iii) provided 3-dimensional coordinates of ReHo abnormalities in stereotactic space at the whole-brain level; (iv) adopted significance thresholds for data that were corrected for multiple comparisons. In some cases, we obtained additional details which were essential for the meta-analysis by contacting the corresponding authors. Exclusion criteria were: (i) the article type of the study is not original investigation; (ii) the peak coordinates of the ReHo alterations could not be retrieved; (iii) the study was based on region of interest (ROI) analytical approach; (iv) the data overlapped with those of another publication. We performed the current meta-analysis based on the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Radua,  ). The coordinates regarding the ReHo changes between OCD patients and HCS in each included study were independently extracted by two investigators. Meanwhile, clinical features (including the sample size, age, gender, illness duration, symptom severity and medication status) and methodological issues (such as the MRI scanner, analytical software, smoothing kernel, number of foci and the threshold for multiple comparison correction) were extracted. If agreement was not obtained, then another author mediated. \n\n\n### Voxel-Wise Meta-Analysis \n  \nUsing the AES-SDM software, we conducted the voxel-wise meta-analysis to explore the most robust ReHo abnormalities in patients with OCD compared with HCS based on the selected studies. Meanwhile, we performed a whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reliability of the main effect. Afterwards, we conducted subgroup meta-analysis of unmedicated OCD patients and the subgroup meta-analysis regarding the threshold for correction was also performed. Subsequently, between-study variance was analyzed in order to assess significant heterogeneity of ReHo abnormalities. The kernel size and thresholds for the main effect and heterogeneity analysis were set as follows: full-width at half-maximum = 20 mm; anisotropy = 1.0, voxel   P   = 0.005, peak height threshold = 1, cluster extent = 100 voxels. We also performed Egger's test for the evaluation of publication bias. Finally, the meta-regression analyses were performed to examine the potential effects of clinical variables (such as symptom severity and illness duration) on the reported ReHo changes. It should be noted that a more conservative threshold (  P   < 0.0005) was used for meta-regression analysis in order to achieve the optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity as suggested by previous publication (Wise et al.,  ). All the analyses are performed according to the AES-SDM tutorial ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nOur search strategy identified a total of 60 studies. Of these, 11 ReHo studies were chosen for further consideration after primary screening. Among the 11 ReHo investigations, One study adopted an ROI analytical method instead of a whole-brain approach (Chen et al.,  ). Another study recruited samples that were overlapped with previous publication (Chen et al.,  ). Therefore, these two studies were excluded from the current meta-analysis. Ultimately, 9 original investigations (Yang et al.,  ,  ,  ; Ping et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Niu et al.,  ; Bu et al.,  ; Hu et al.,  ; Xia et al.,  ) met the inclusion criteria (see   for details). No additional articles were found in the reference lists of the included studies. One investigation included two different subgroups of OCD patients (autogenous-type OCD and reactive-type OCD, two different types of obsessions in OCD proposed by Lee and Kwon,  ; Xia et al.,  ). We treated this investigation as two unique datasets, with each patient subgroup selected independently in the current meta-analysis. Therefore, a total of 10 datasets comprising 359 OCD patients and 361 HCS were included in our meta-analysis, along with 80 coordinates extracted from these 10 datasets. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age and sex. The mean age was 27.35 years in the OCD patient group vs. 26.56 years in the HCS group while there were 142 (39.6%) female OCD patients vs. 149 (41.2%) female HCS. The demographic details from all recruited studies were well-described in the   while the technical details of the included studies were available in the  . \n  \nFlow diagram regarding the identification and attrition of studies.

Meanwhile, lower ReHo was identified in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral cerebellum in OCD patients (see   and   for details). All aforementioned clusters did not reveal significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (  p   > 0.005). Additionally, none of the clusters showed significant publication bias in the Egger's test (  p   > 0.05). \n  \nResults of the meta-analysis of whole-brain ReHo studies in patients with OCD.

Unfortunately, we failed to perform the subgroup meta-analyses regarding other clinical subtypes or imaging methodologies because there were not enough primary datasets. \n  \nSensitivity analyses of clusters with altered ReHo between OCD patients and controls from 9 included studies (10 datasets) in the current meta-analysis. \n  \n IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; N, no; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder; OFG, orbitofrontal gyrus; ReHo, regional homogeneity;.

The lower ReHo in the bilateral cerebellum failed to emerge in one of the study combinations while the higher ReHo in the right IFG and OFC failed to emerge in two of the study combinations. The detailed results of the whole brain jackknife sensitivity analyses were shown in the  . \n\n\n### Meta-Regression Analysis \n  \nThe clinical Information of the patients with OCD including the age, gender, symptom severity and illness duration was available for all the 10 datasets. Using a stringent threshold of   P   < 0.0005 to minimize spurious findings, our meta regression revealed that samples with longer illness duration of OCD patients had more decreased ReHo in the OFC, which had been found as anomalous in the main effect. That is, the illness duration was negatively associated with the ReHo in the OFC (x = 0, y = 46, z = \u22122; SDM-Z = \u22123.304,   P   = 0.000005677; 428 voxels) ( ). Other relevant clinical variables were not correlated, at least linearly, with OCD-related ReHo alterations. \n  \nResults of meta-regression analysis illustrating a negative association between the ReHo in the OFC and the illness duration in patients with OCD.

Using AES-SDM approach, our meta-analysis identified that patients with OCD showed higher ReHo in the bilateral IFG and OFC. Meanwhile, lower ReHo was identified in the SMA and bilateral cerebellum in OCD patients. These findings remained stable when jackknife sensitivity analyses were performed, which suggested that the results of our meta-analysis were robust and reliable. \n\nIn line with the classical CSTC model of OCD, we identified higher ReHo in the bilateral IFG and OFC in OCD patients relative to the HCS. The prefrontal dysfunction is widely considered to be implicated in the psychopathology of OCD (Pauls et al.,  ). Localized connectivity dysfunction in bilateral IFG might be associated with impairments of cognitive control, which had been consistently reported in OCD patients (Shin et al.,  ). Previous multicenter mega-analytical publication has demonstrated smaller gray matter volume in bilateral IFG in OCD patients while the current study revealed higher ReHo in the bilateral IFG (de Wit et al.,  ). We speculated that the hyper-activation of bilateral IFG is a compensatory response to the gray matter structural deficits of IFG. It is reported that the OFC plays an essential role in reward processing (Milad and Rauch,  ). Recent meta-analysis has demonstrated lower fractional anisotropy in the left orbitofrontal white matter of OCD patients, which was negatively and independently associated with symptom severity and illness duration in patients with OCD (Hu et al.,  ). One animal experiment indicated that giving repeated stimulation to the OFC of the mice could lead to persistent OCD-like behaviors (Ahmari et al.,  ). Grover et al. found that high-frequency neuromodulation of OFC could improve obsessive-compulsive behavior (Grover et al.,  ). In the current study, higher ReHo in the OFC may be related the behavioral deficits of OCD patients since OCD patients perform poorly on tasks that require adjusting responses based on changing reward feedback (Marsh et al.,  ). Additionally, our meta-regression analysis showed a negative correlation between the illness duration and the ReHo in the OFC. Previous study demonstrated a negative association between disease duration and ReHo value in the bilateral OFC in OCD patients at the whole-brain level (Niu et al.,  ). Yun et al. performed a multicenter study and found the centrality of orbito-frontal cortical surface areas was negatively correlated with OCD illness duration (Yun et al.,  ). Based on the evidence above, we proposed that the OFC might be related to the illness chronicity in OCD. However, this meta-regression finding should be interpreted with caution since two datasets (Ping et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ) in the current meta-analysis included OCD patients who were on stable doses of serotonin reuptake inhibitors at the time of the MRI scanning. Beucke et al. reported that antidepressant medication might affect the neural function within the CSTC circuits in OCD (Beucke et al.,  ). Therefore, further studies would be warranted to clarify our meta-regression finding. \n\nIt should be noted that prior meta-analysis reported decreased ReHo in the left caudate nucleus (Hao et al.,  ) while our meta analysis identified no ReHo alterations in the striatum. One possible reason accounting for the inconsistency is the differences of included datasets. A larger number of datasets was included in the current meta analysis (  N   = 10) than in the previous publication (  N   = 8). As suggested by Radua and his colleagues, the minimum of 10 studies was essential for the reliability of performing the SDM meta-analysis (Carlisi et al.,  ; Muller et al.,  ). Therefore, we confirmed the validity of the current meta-analysis. \n\nThe SMA is considered to be implicated in movement initiation and inhibition, response selection, and motor planning (Bonini et al.,  ). A task-based MRI study demonstrated that OCD patients and their siblings showed greater activity in the left SMA during successful inhibition paradigm relative to HCS, indicating that the SMA hyperactivity is a neurocognitive endophenotype of OCD (de Wit et al.,  ). Another study found that increased correlation of the error-related negativity in the event-related potential and activation of SMA might indicate stronger recruitment of proactive control in OCD (Grutzmann et al.,  ). Our meta-analysis revealed lower ReHo in the SMA, suggesting that hypo-activation of the SMA might be involved the pathophysiology of OCD. \n\nAnother interesting finding is that we identified lower ReHo in the bilateral cerebellum in OCD patients. Besides the traditional role of motor control, researches have proved that the cerebellum is involved in cognitive control (Buckner,  ) and information processing (Ramnani,  ). In fact, the cerebellum offers output to the cerebral cortex and tunes sensory input for facilitating behavioral adjustment in response to feedback (Gao et al.,  ). Sha et al. reported greater somatomotor-cerebellar connectivity in OCD patients and highlighted somatomotor-cerebellar circuits as potential targets for novel treatments in OCD (Sha et al.,  ). One study demonstrated decreased dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) of cerebellum in drug-naive OCD patients using the sliding-window approach (Liu et al.,  ). Meanwhile, another rs-fMRI study identified decreased cerebellar-cerebral functional connectivity in executive control and emotion processing networks in OCD patients (Xu et al.,  ). Taken collectively, our meta analysis emphasized the role of cerebellum in the pathogenesis of OCD. \n\nIn terms of the significance of ReHo alterations, previous investigations suggested that the index of ReHo could contribute the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations at the baseline (Anderson et al.,  ). An elevation of prefrontal ReHo might suggest an pronounced participation of this brain region in the neurophysiological functions such as the rumination (Dar and Iqbal,  ) while a reduction of ReHo usually occurs alongside an increase in distributed connectivity during late neurodevelopment (Fair et al.,  ; Supekar et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral limitations of the current meta-analysis should be addressed. First, our meta-analysis was performed on the basis of stereotactic coordinates extracted from each included dataset instead of raw brain maps (Radua et al.,  ), which might result in less accurate findings. Second, as the number of datasets included in our meta analysis was small, we failed to perform subgroup meta-analyses. Third, the potential effects of drug treatment could not be fully ruled out since a majority of studies employing OCD patients who were on drug treatment. Future ReHo studies recruiting unmedicated OCD patients are still needed to verify the reproducibility of the findings in the current meta analysis. Forth, it should be pointed out that all the included studies were conducted in China, which limited the generalizability of the our findings to other populations. Finally, the meta-regression results should be regarded as preliminary finding rather than conclusive evidence because the number of eligible studies for meta-regression analysis is limited. \n\nIn summary, the current meta-analysis presented a quantitative overview of ReHo findings in OCD and demonstrated that the most consistent localized connectivity abnormalities in individuals with OCD are in the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, our findings provided evidence that the hypo-activation of SMA and cerebellum might be associated with the pathophysiology of OCD, which might give additional explanation to the well known CSTC model of OCD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article\/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author\/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nLG and DL designed the study.

We aimed to provide evidence for a multi-componential neural system for creativity. We applied a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to 45 fMRI studies. Three individual ALE analyses were performed to assess creativity in different cognitive domains (Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial). The general ALE revealed that creativity relies on clusters of activations in the bilateral occipital, parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes. The individual ALE revealed different maximal activation in different domains. Musical creativity yields activations in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, in the left cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule and in the right postcentral and fusiform gyri. Verbal creativity yields activations mainly located in the left hemisphere, in the prefrontal cortex, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral and supramarginal gyri, middle occipital gyrus, and insula. The right inferior frontal gyrus and the lingual gyrus were also activated. Visuo-spatial creativity activates the right middle and inferior frontal gyri, the bilateral thalamus and the left precentral gyrus. This evidence suggests that creativity relies on multi-componential neural networks and that different creativity domains depend on different brain regions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe ability to form novel ideas is crucial for human civilization, progress, and innovation. Creativity has been defined as \u201cthe introduction of something innovatively new and positive for society that goes beyond the familiar and accepted\u201d ( , p. 1) and concerns many domains of human activities ( ), such as science, technology, economy, and arts. However, creativity concerns not only exceptional realizations, such as scientific discoveries or the production of artworks, but also everyday activities, such as finding new solutions and thinking away from ordinary ideas. Furthermore, creativity includes the appropriateness ( ;  ) of the new ideas and solutions. The product of creativity must, in fact, involve an actual use in a specific context, rather than a hypothetical use. \n\nEvolution has strongly fostered creativity. Bio-social pressures toward creativity are thought to have shaped the evolution of the human brain ( ). Previous neuroimaging studies failed to find a clear neuroanatomical localization of creative processes (for a review, see  ;  ): creativity does not appear to critically rely on any single brain area and it is not especially associated with the right or left brain hemispheres ( ). The failure to find any clear neuroanatomical localization is likely due to the fact that creativity is a multifaceted process, which is supported by high-level mental operations, both independent (for example, abstraction;  ) and dependent (for example, domain-specific operations) on the specific domains of knowledge.   found that verbal creativity is mostly domain-specific, but can also be affected by processes in the visual domain, whereas visual creativity is domain- and task-specific. Various different approaches and tasks have been used to explore creativity. Some rely on the ability to find one correct solution to closed problems, such as insight problem solving, others rely on the ability to find new, appropriate, and different answers to open-ended problems, such as divergent thinking, creative cognition, and artistic creativity. \n\nThe divergent thinking approach was introduced by  ,  ). The Alternative Uses Task (AUT), which requires individuals to generate as many different alternative uses of a specific object (e.g., a brick) as possible, was initially used to assess divergent thinking in terms of ideational fluency (the number of ideas), flexibility (the number of categories that encompass ideas), originality (infrequency of ideas), and elaboration (the number of details added to basic ideas). In the wake of  ,  ) work,   developed the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), which was aimed at measuring divergent thinking in verbal and visual forms. Recently, the idea that divergent thinking is an indicator of creative potential without guaranteeing actual creative achievement has emerged ( ). In addition, divergent thinking is supported by convergent thinking for the evaluation of the novelty of ideas ( ). \n\nThe creative cognition approach is mainly based on the \u2018Geneplore\u2019 model ( ;  ) that focuses on mental operations involved in visual creativity. This approach assumes that generative (e.g., memory retrieval, mental synthesis) and exploratory (e.g., conceptual interpretation, functional inference) processes support creativity. Specifically, generative processes support the construction of visual pre-inventive ideas, whereas exploratory processes examine and interpret the pre-inventive ideas. The Geneplore model was operationalized by means of the creative synthesis task ( ,  ), which allows individuals to imagine and manipulate visual elements (e.g., square, wire, and bracket), in order to create an object belonging to a specific category. Independent judges are then asked to score the inventions on the basis of different criteria, such as originality and practicality, according to the Consensual Assessment Technique developed by  . Investigations based on this Model have highlighted, among other things, that mental imagery \u2013 a complex cognitive process arising when perceptual information is accessed from the memory, giving rise to the experience of \u201cseeing with the mind\u2019s eye\u201d ( ;  ) \u2013 seems to have a pivotal role in directing creative processes. This is confirmed by several scientific studies (e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nArtistic creativity has been described in terms of an altered state of mind, beyond conscious awareness ( ). This makes it more difficult to investigate artistic creativity and its cognitive and neural underpinnings. In these last years, the neural processes underlying free generation and selection of possible alternatives have been investigated by using simpler model behaviors, which resemble valid examples of creativity in musical ( ) and visual domains ( ). \n\nDespite the variety of creativity domains, and of the approaches and tasks used, many pivotal processes supporting creativity can be identified. First, executive functions, such as planning, working memory, attention, and semantic memory retrieval are required. These processes facilitate both the selection ( ) and evaluation of the utility of novel ideas ( ). Accordingly, the prefrontal cortex recruitment (e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \u2013 DLPFC) has been widely shown as being involved in verbal divergent thinking based on ideational fluency (e.g.,  ;  ), story generation ( ;  ), metaphor production ( ), creative objects production ( ;  ), visual art ( ;  ), and musical improvisation (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Second, creativity also relies on an associative mode of processing ( ), which is supported by the default mode network (e.g., the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, temporoparietal junction, part of the medial temporal lobe and the inferior parietal cortex \u2013  ). Interestingly, the default mode network is activated during different creativity performances (e.g.,  ;  ). Third, memory processes also support creativity. The medial temporal lobe (hippocampal and parahippocampal regions) is recruited during verbal divergent thinking ( ), creative writing ( ), metaphor production ( ), visual creativity ( ), and visual art ( ). According to   the connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the temporal, occipital and parietal cortices, sites of long-term memory storage (e.g.,  ), are essential for creativity. Furthermore, brain areas generally involved in mental imagery, such as the middle occipital gyrus and parietal lobes ( ;  ;  ), can be recruited during creativity, suggesting a top\u2013down control on the construction of the images, even if visual information is not directly manipulated. \n\nHere we aimed to find the neural correlates of creativity in general and those more strictly correlated with the cognitive domain. In the present study creativity is operationally defined as the ability to find new, appropriate, and different answers to open-ended problems, focusing on the idea that a valid assessment of creativity requires tasks that are sufficiently open-ended to encourage divergent production ( ). We applied a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on creativity based on open-ended mental problems, to find converging evidence for a neural network for creativity in the human brain. Furthermore, three individual ALE analyses were performed to assess whether creativity in different domains (i.e., Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial) involves different brain areas. The decision to explore Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial creativity was made because these were the only domains in which the number of experiments and critical contrasts was sufficient for statistical testing. \n\nFollowing  , p. 822) idea of functionally subdividing different types of creativity \u201cto make creativity tractable in the brain,\u201d we hypothesized that, beyond a common pattern of brain activations generally underpining idea generation in the attempt to solve open-ended problems, different brain regions underpin different domains of creativity and that a multi-componential neural system underpins creative thinking in humans. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Inclusion Criteria for Papers \n  \nA systematic method was adopted to review the literature. The search was carried out with the aid of PubMed, using the following string: \u201ccreativity and fMRI.\u201d A total of 56 studies were found. \n\nOur   a priori   inclusion criteria for papers were: (1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); thus, we excluded positron emission tomography (PET) studies, electrophysiology studies and papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. (2) Provision of coordinates of activation foci, both in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the Talairach reference space. (3) All participants in the studies had to be young and healthy. (4) Only studies focusing on open-ended mental problems were included in the meta-analysis; thus we excluded studies exploring neural correlates of idea generation based on closed-ended problems, such as problems based on the combination of remote semantic associations, which generally underpin insight (a stage of the creative process) rather than creativity   per se  . This decision was made following the idea that the \u201crigorous investigation of creativity requires tasks that are suitable for quantified psychometrics but also sufficiently open-ended to be construct-valid assays of creativity (i.e., they must allow freedom for divergent production)\u201d ( , p. 924). (5) Only group studies involving a sample size of at least five participants were included. (6) There could be no pharmacological manipulation. (7) Only activation foci were considered. Thus, studies reporting only deactivation foci were excluded from our meta-analysis. (8) Only peer-reviewed original articles were included. Using these criteria we selected 24 articles. The studies are summarized in   Table   , where the subdivision according to domains (Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial) is also shown (see below). \n  \nList of papers included in the meta-analysis for each domain. \n    \n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nThe coordinates from studies identified in 24 published papers were used for ALE, which models the uncertainty in the localization of activation foci using Gaussian probability density distributions ( ). In other words, ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modeling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one ( ). This is calculated at each voxel and results in a thresholded ALE map. The probabilities of all activation foci in a given experiment were combined for each voxel, yielding a modeled activation map ( ). ALE scores quantified the convergence across experiments at each particular location in the brain. ALE scores were compared against an empirical null distribution reflecting a random spatial association between the model activation maps ( ). \n\nWe performed a general ALE meta-analysis on the foci derived from the selected studies (  Table   ). The coordinates of the foci were taken from the original papers. A total of 492 foci were reported in 45 experiments involving 1007 participants. \n\nWe also performed three separate ALE analyses to assess the neural correlates of creativity in different cognitive domains (i.e., Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial). The experimenters (Maddalena Boccia, Laura Piccardi, Liana Palermo, Raffaella Nori, and Massimiliano Palmiero) independently classified the studies. Studies including different cognitive domains were excluded from these analyses: the data from these studies were included in the general analysis but not in the further analyses. Separate ALE analyses were performed on (1) 13 studies assessing musical creativity (219 participants, 197 activation foci), (2) 24 studies assessing verbal creativity (575 participants, 207 activation foci), and (3) six studies assessing visuo-spatial creativity (164 participants, 52 activation foci). \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE  2.3.1 with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE), according to   procedure. The Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) value was automatically computed, as this parameter is empirically determined ( ). The thresholded ALE map was corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR), at a 0.05 level of significance. Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200 mm  was chosen. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template using MRICRO. Hereafter the link to access MRICRO \n\n\n### Tasks and Contrasts Taken into Account \n  \nRegarding the musical domain, participants were instructed to improvise music of various kinds (Classical, Jazz, etc.) on simple piano keyboards designed for usage in the scanner. In particular, music improvisation performed by modification of a melodic template was contrasted with the memorized improvisation previously made ( ); music improvisation using notes within the C major scale with over-learned tracks ( ); lyric improvisation using an 8-bar instrumental track at 85 beats per minute with the memorized lyrics ( ); melody improvisation and pseudo-random key presses production with sight reading of a musical score ( ); rhythmic (note choice constrained) and melody (note choice free) improvisation with or without metronome click synchronization with the reproduction of simple pre-learned 5-note patterns ( ); rhythm improvisation (based on a rhythm listened to) with the reproduction of the rhythm heard ( ); music improvisation (tonal, atonal, happy, and fearful) with the rest condition ( ). \n\nRegarding the verbal domain, the ability to find alternative uses for an object, such as \u2018a brick\u2019 (AUT), was contrasted with fluency objects for location (indicating different objects in a specific place, such as an office), using the AU vs. 2-back memory ( ) as inclusive mask; the AUT with the fluency object for location and both these tasks with 1- and 2-back memory tasks in males vs. females and vice versa ( ). Furthermore, new ideas (unknown) provided by the AUT were contrasted with old ideas (recruited from the memory), and both new\/old ideas vs. zero ( ), whereas common or uncommon uses of objects were contrasted with a perceptual baseline task ( ). The AUT was also contrasted with the object characteristic task (find typical characteristics of objects), the Incubation-AUT (reflect on ideas and elaborate them) with the standard AUT and vice versa, the Stimulation-AUT (the stimulus word was presented with three other people\u2019s ideas) with the standard AUT ( ); the Stimulation-AUT (original\/common ideas of other people) with the control condition (the stimulus word was presented with two pseudowords) and the Stimulation-AUT (original) with Stimulation-AUT (common), ( ). In addition, the generation of metaphor was contrasted with the production of literal responses (synonyms of adjectives;  ); the unusual or creative generation of verbs in response to specific nouns with the generation of verbs that first came to mind ( ) or with uncreative verbs ( ); the generation of creative stories from three words with uncreative stories and the generation of stories from unrelated words with stories from related words in the set ( ); the creative writing was contrasted with the copying of a given text ( ); the generation of inventive conceptions (biological functional feature associations) with ordinary conceptions (non-biological functional feature associations) and with baseline ( ). \n\nRegarding the visuo-spatial domain, the generation of unique responses to Rorschach\u2019s test was contrasted with the generation of frequent responses ( ); the creative synthesis task (combination of three shapes, such as a circle, an \u20188\u2019 and a \u2018C, to form a creative object) with the reconstruction of a shape by combining three distinct stimuli in which the original shape was trisected ( ); the generation of ideas while designing book cover illustrations with the evaluation of ideas generated ( ); the generation of creative pictures based on given visual clues with the generation of uncreative figures not necessarily unique ( ). Finally,   explored the neural correlates of designing of a new pen in experts and novices. \n\n\n### Results \n  \n#### Neural Correlates of Creativity \n  \nThe general ALE meta-analysis showed clusters of activations ranging from the occipital to the frontal lobe (  Table   ), in both the left and the right hemispheres (  Figure   ). Specifically, we found consistent activations in the bilateral inferior, middle and medial frontal gyri as well as in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In the left hemisphere we found consistent activations in the precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, insula, cingulate gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. In the right hemisphere we found clusters of activation in the superior temporal gyrus.

First of all, we performed a general ALE analysis to give a general picture of the brain networks involved in creativity. Then three separate ALE analyses were performed in order to assess the neural correlates of creativity in Musical, Verbal, and Visuo-spatial domains. We found a wide network of areas, ranging from the occipital to the frontal lobe, in both left and right hemispheres. A functional specialization was found within this network for different types of creativity, confirming  , p. 822) idea that distinguishing different types of creativity is valuable \u201cto make creativity tractable in the brain.\u201d This is also in line with the hypothesis of the existence of a functional multi-componential system in the human brain for creative thinking. Even if previous quantitative meta-analyses on creativity have been made ( ), to our knowledge this is the first meta-analysis clearly disentangling the brain regions underpinning musical, verbal, and visuo-spatial creativity, based on the generation of creative solutions to open-ended problems. \n\nSpecifically, the recruitment of executive functions is crucial for creativity. The activations found in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and middle frontal gyri (DLPFC), may be strictly connected to \u201cmore executive\u201d aspects of creativity, since these areas are activated during conditions of high cognitive control ( ). In particular, activation of the DLPFC is correlated with effortful problem-solving, monitoring, and focused attention ( ). DLPFC also plays a key role in the selection process ( ), being linked to extra working memory load due to keeping in mind different alternatives ( ) and comparing many different stimuli. Thus, although these processes were not directed tested, it is not surprising that the DLPFC was found to be consistently activated during Musical (right hemisphere), Verbal (left hemisphere), and Visuo-spatial (right hemisphere) creativity, which generally require effortful problem solving, focused attention, selection process and working memory. \n\nConcerning specific-domain activations, we found that verbal creativity consistently activated the left inferior frontal gyrus. Since verbal creativity has been reported to require the ability to integrate distant semantic concepts or ideas in a new fashion ( ;  ;  ), by means of semantic retrieval and selection of stored knowledge ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), these processes may well have entailed the activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. On the other hand, attentional processes ( ) and successful response inhibition (e.g.,  ) may entail activations of the right inferior frontal gyrus. However, these activations were found both during verbal and visuo-spatial creativity, but not during musical improvisation, which seems to rely more upon response inhibition. Thus, although one might claim that the inhibition of competitive responses during the creative act is supported by the right inferior frontal gyrus, the functional role of this area while performing on musical, verbal or visuo-spatial creativity tasks needs to be more fully addressed. \n\nThe high cognitive control during musical and verbal creativity also induced activations of the left inferior parietal lobule. Hemispheric specialization has been proposed for this area. Specifically, verbal attention ( ), and language-related processes with a focus on semantic and phonological issues ( ) were found to recruit the left inferior parietal lobule, which also belongs to the default mode network ( ). Furthermore, although the activations of the left inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus and insula shown by the general ALE analysis might also indicate multimodal sensory processing and the representation of subjective experience during spontaneous creativity ( ), further study is necessary to better clarify this issue. \n\nInterestingly, musical and visuo-spatial creativity activate regions involved in motor planning, such as the right supplementary and the left premotor cortices, probably indicating that a motor and temporal planning is crucial for creative musical improvisation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), as well as in the visuo-spatial rotation of objects ( ) during visuo-spatial creativity. \n\nThe posterior activations found in the temporal (left middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus) and occipital (bilateral middle occipital gyrus) lobes across different creativity domains deserve consideration. According to  , the posterior cortices are essential for creativity, being the sites of long-term memory storage (e.g.,  ) and being connected to the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, given that creativity relies on an associative mode of processing, heightening focused attention to stored knowledge that facilitates efficient retrieval and recombination of existing information ( ), the activation of the posterior cortices may be the neural correlates of such processes. Moreover, given that these areas have a pivotal role in generating mental images ( ), these results could also support the relationship between creative processes and mental imagery. Specifically, according to the Perceptual Anticipation Theory, mental images arise when an individual \u201canticipates perceiving an object or scene so strongly that a depictive representation of the stimulus is generated in early visual cortex\u201d ( ; p. 724). Thus, it may be that information stored in the long-term memory is selectively retrieved and used to form mental images, which subtend the generation of creative ideas. Other brain areas are then needed to explore and finalize ideas in different cognitive domains. In this direction, musical creativity showed the activation of the right fusiform gyrus and parietal postcentral gyrus, whereas verbal creativity showed the recruitment of the left middle and superior temporal gyri, right lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and left parietal postcentral gyrus. \n\nFinally, the right posterior cerebellum was recruited in both verbal and musical creativity, indicating searching processes for appropriate responses ( ). Such a result suggests that the cerebellum may have an important role in creativity. Indeed, by permitting previously executed movements, which have been proved to be advantageous, the cerebellum allows individual motor sequences to be consolidated into more complex patterns underlying the generation of novel creative outcomes ( ). However, due to the lack of systematic studies on this issue, the specific role of the cerebellum in creativity is still unclear. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of the present meta-analysis of fMRI studies of creatvity based on open-ended problems in musical, verbal, and visuo-spatial domains suggest that different domains of creativity roughly correspond to a higher activation in functionally specialized brain areas. In general, frontal areas seem to be crucial for idea generation, although there are slight differences across creativity domains. Activation of the DLPFC was found in all creativity domains under investigation, whereas the inferior frontal gyrus was recruited consistently in verbal creativity and weakly in visuo-spatial creativity. This finding suggests that creativity relies on the activation of the prefrontal cortex, which likely works as an executive engine, managing attentional recourses, retrieving, and selecting appropriate information. Future studies should take into account the \u2018gateway hypothesis\u2019 ( ), which highlights the role of the rostral prefrontal cortex on attending behavior that enhances the ability to notice change in the environment (stimulus-oriented cognition) as well as on self-generated or maintained representations (stimulus-independent cognition). Focusing on this latter ability, the lateral rostral prefrontal cortex would work as a \u2018gateway\u2019 between the process of selection of actions or thought operations and the stimulus-independent attending system, ensuring that activation of representations is less affected by sensory input. This is exactly the case of creativity, which is mainly based on stimulus-independent processes, retrieval of information from the memory and selection of the most appropriate responses to satisfy specific criteria, such as originality and appropriateness. Unfortunately the gateway hypothesis has never been directly tested by means of a paradigm investigating creativity. \n\nInterestingly, part of the default network (the left inferior parietal lobule) and different temporal, parietal, and occipital areas were found to be recruited while performing on musical and verbal creativity, but not when performing on visual creativity. Also the right posterior cerebellum was activated during both musical and verbal creative processes. Thus, the present meta-analysis would seem to indicate that musical and verbal creativity share common areas that involve attentional, searching, and associative modes of processing of stored knowledge from the posterior cortices, and temporarily represent information in the working memory buffer with the aid of prefrontal areas. On the contrary, visuo-spatial creativity would appear to rely consistently on the perception and manipulation of visual stimuli, such as the rotation of shapes; in this direction, visuo-spatial creativity strongly yielded activations in the bilateral thalamus and premotor cortices, the former being involved in relaying sensory information, the latter in finalizing in a top\u2013down fashion the goal-directed planning of novel ideas. However, it is surprising that visuo-spatial creativity did not produce the activation of any temporal, parietal, and above all occipital regions, considering that the recruitment of these areas was reported in various studies of visual creativity (e.g.,  ). Probably, given the scarcity of the number of experiments (6\u2013164 participants, 52 activation foci) belonging to the visuo-spatial domain, the ALE analysis did not highlight these results, thus making the findings somewhat less reliable. \n\nTherefore, generally speaking, creativity seems to emerge when the prefrontal cortex, posterior temporal, and parietal areas are recruited. This is also confirmed by studies with dementia patients (for a review, see  ), who show a decline in divergent thinking and artistic creativity when these areas are damaged. On the other hand, it is possible that, since all the studies we included in the ALE meta-analysis checked for early visuo-spatial features by using well-designed control conditions, the ALE statistics only showed brain areas more related to general visuo-spatial creative processes, such as premotor regions supporting mental rotation of stimuli, rather than to visual properties   per se  . This is also true in the case of musical creativity, in which we found no activation of the auditory cortex. It should be stressed, though, that all the included studies compared activations during a creative condition (usually assessed by means of musical improvisation) with those during a control condition (usually assessed by means of the reproduction of conventional pieces). The failure to find any activation of the auditory cortex is likely due to the fact that this area is generally involved in musical and auditory processes but it is not directly entailed in musical creativity. \n\nRegarding the lateralization issue, the unbalanced number of studies across the domains could account for the activations mainly of the left hemisphere in the general ALE analysis. However, looking at the separate ALE analyses, musical and verbal creativity showed predominant activations in the left hemisphere, whereas visuo-spatial creativity in the right hemisphere, but a clear laterality effect was not found. This suggests that inter-hemispheric interaction is required in all domains of creative processes ( ) and supports the idea that creative processes are subtended by different brain areas and functional specialized brain regions rather than by a specific brain area. \n\nFinally, on the basis of the findings outlined above, creativity appears to be a multifaceted process, involving different mental functions, and studied using different approaches and tasks. Although the number of experiments and critical contrasts in each category separately is, at present, insufficient for statistical testing, in the future, in order to reach more reliable conclusions, neural correlates of creativity should be studied considering the interaction among the domains, approaches and tasks used. A higher number of studies will also allow for a contrast analysis and a conjunction analysis among different creativity domains, now impossible due to the paucity of the studies. Different creativity domains should also be explored, such as dance and scientific innovation. Of course this meta-analysis was not aimed at determining the specific executive, default and memory processes supported by cerebral regions during creativity. Further studies should therefore explore whether and how idea generation and evaluation emerge in different creativity domains. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4531218,"text_md5":"f99f7b5fcc3b413bf2808e7930553d95","field_positions":{"authors":[0,103],"journal":[104,117],"publication_year":[119,123],"title":[134,254],"keywords":[268,419],"abstract":[432,1892],"body":[1901,34822]},"batch":2,"pmid":26322002,"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01195","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4531218","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4531218"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4531218\">4531218<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4531218  Where do bright ideas occur in our brain?

Yet, findings from individual studies remain mixed. In the present quantitative functional neuroimaging meta-analysis, we summarized across 50 fMRI studies of social cognition to identify consistent differences in neural activation as a function of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. We investigated if such differences varied according to a specific social category (i.e. race) and specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We found that social cognition about in-group members was more reliably related to activity in brain regions associated with mentalizing (e.g. dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), whereas social cognition about out-group members was more reliably related to activity in regions associated with exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula). These findings replicated for studies specifically focused on the social category of race, and we further found intergroup differences in neural activation during empathy and emotion perception tasks. These results help shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition across group lines. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFrom an early age, humans tend to categorize ourselves and others as \u2018us versus them\u2019 ( ;  ). These categorizations can lead individuals to enact disparate behaviors toward in-group and out-group members. For example, individuals tend to behave in ways that favor in-group members (i.e. in-group favoritism) and disfavor out-group members ( ;  ;  ). Such is the case when White individuals assign less harsh legal punishments to White (  vs   Black) targets ( ) or grant more comprehensive medical care to White patients compared to patients of other races ( ;  ). Further, perceptions of out-groups as more homogenous than one\u2019s in-group (i.e. out-group homogeneity effect) can also influence social behavior in intergroup interactions ( ;  ;  ;  ). This can manifest in the individuals\u2019 tendency to be less discerning in their perception of emotional expressions of out-group members ( ), which may engender discriminatory behavior via stereotyping and prejudice ( ). \n\nIt is clear from this behavioral literature that social categorizations matter: the ways in which we think about one another vary depending on perceived in-group   vs   out-group status ( ). Further, these differences in in-group   vs   out-group social cognition can underlie biased social behaviors ( ;  ;  ). However, it is less clear \u2018how\u2019 exactly an individual\u2019s group membership sets into action the neural processes that may ultimately mediate biased behavior. \n\n### Neuroscience of intergroup social cognition \n  \nNeuroimaging approaches have been widely used over the past two decades to address this \u2018how\u2019 by examining the neural mechanisms that underlie social cognitive processes directed toward in-group   vs   out-group members. For instance, consistent with the in-group favoritism effect, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal greater activity in the ventral striatum for in-group members ( ) and more amygdala activity for out-group members ( ;  ), suggesting that in-group members may be perceived as more valuable and\/or rewarding and out-group members might be more uncertain, ambiguous or aversive. Moreover, consistent with an out-group homogeneity effect, greater activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) for in-group members ( ;  ) and less activity in dmPFC for out-group members ( ) further underscore the fact that people may more likely attribute unique and rich mental qualities to in-group compared to out-group members. \n\nHowever, inconsistencies in the literature also abound, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social cognition. For instance, some neuroimaging studies reveal greater insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation to out-group members during emotion perception tasks ( ;  ), whereas others show greater activity in these regions during in-group emotion perception ( ;  ;  ;  ). Similarly, some studies in which group membership is based on race find greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018out-group\u2019 faces, which may reflect other-race negativity bias ( ;  ;  ). However, neuroimaging studies involving social categorization based on minimal groups (e.g. red team   vs   blue team) have demonstrated greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018in-group\u2019 members ( ). These results suggest that the specific type of social grouping under consideration (i.e. race   vs   minimal group) may influence the neural regions engaged during social cognition across group lines ( ;  ). These inconsistencies are further complicated by the fact that individual neuroimaging studies are more prone to Type I errors due to small sample sizes and insufficient statistical corrections ( ). \n\nSince past studies in this area assess diverse social categories (e.g. race and minimal groups) and social cognitive processes (e.g. empathy and emotion perception), it is important to identify the core neural mechanisms underlying in-group and out-group social cognition across the literature. This is particularly important in light of the fact that it is not possible to make inferences about generalized intergroup neural processes from single studies that only investigate one type of social group (e.g. race). Further, while some studies offer evidence of the neural regions involved in generalized social categorization ( ;  ), still relatively little is known about how the brain distinguishes between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 more broadly. Meta-analysis is useful in this context because it allows us to identify the most reliable patterns of activation across several studies, regardless of the social category of distinction in any individual study. Further, this analytic tool overcomes the limitations associated with sample size, power and experimental design inherent in individual fMRI studies ( ;  ) to help reveal the functional neuroanatomy or \u2018neural reference space\u2019 consistently related to a process of interest (i.e. intergroup social cognition;  ). \n\nAdditionally, research needs to address how neural activity in intergroup contexts varies according to both the \u2018social category\u2019 assessed and \u2018social cognitive process\u2019 involved. Thus, we also aimed to use meta-analysis to identify how the neural mechanisms of intergroup social cognition may reliably vary as a function of a specific \u2018social category\u2019 (i.e. race) and two particular \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019 (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We focused on \u2018race\u2019 as a key social category, given the importance of race-based bias in inter-race contexts ( ;  ) and the consequences of these behaviors on the health and well-being of marginalized racial group members ( ). Further, we focused on \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019, given that these are two of the most studied processes in the intergroup social cognition fMRI literature ( ), and it is commonly argued that these social cognitive processes allow perceivers to represent the uniquely human experiences of group members that are important to intergroup relations ( ;  ). Investigating these in-group\/out-group differences in the neural underpinnings of social cognition according to racial grouping and among the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception will provide a more nuanced understanding of how group membership may shape behavior in intergroup contexts, especially in the case of race-based biases in social behavior. \n\n\n### The present study \n  \nIn sum, this meta-analysis addressed four primary questions: (i) Are a core set of brain regions reliably involved during social cognition across various \u2018social categories\u2019 and \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019? (ii) Do the neural correlates of in-group\/out-group social cognition consistently differ when \u2018race\u2019 is the category on which the target\u2019s group membership is based? (iii) Does neural activation across in-group   vs   out-group consistently differ when \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019 are the specific social cognitive processes engaged? (iv) Finally, within the specific social category of race, does neural activation consistently differ according to the specific social cognitive process engaged (i.e. empathy and emotion perception)? \n\nOur analysis expands upon a prior meta-analysis ( ) of \u223c30 studies which found that the amygdala, ACC, fusiform gyrus and right insula were reliably involved in distinguishing between in-group and out-group members generally. The current meta-analysis contains a total of 50 studies published through 2000\u20132018 and utilizes multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) as opposed to activation likelihood estimation technique used in  . Moreover, the present paper extends this prior work, which did not distinguish between a variety of social categories and types of social cognition, to examine the more specific neural correlates of intergroup social cognition for the social category of race and the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and search strategy \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards ( ), our search strategy first collected relevant papers from PubMed and PsycINFO. We searched for English-language publications of fMRI studies that examined processing of in-group\/out-group human targets. The initial search terms used were \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009in-group\u2009+\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009group membership\u2019. We also used these terms in conjunction with various social categories to capture as many different in-group\/out-groups as possible (see  ). \n\nTitles and abstracts of papers from these searches were reviewed to eliminate any clearly irrelevant studies or duplicates. The initial searches also resulted in several narrative review papers, which we mined for additional papers but excluded from the database of studies. Next, we completed full-text screening to eliminate studies that did not meet the following criteria: (i) participants were healthy, non-medicated adults; (ii) used fMRI to measure BOLD signal as an index of neural activity; (iii) coordinates of activation for contrasts were reported in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space and (iv) reported contrasts that directly compared processing of distinguishable in-group   vs   out-group (or vice versa) targets. We included both contrasts involving explicit processing of in-group\/out-group distinctions (e.g. categorization of stimuli by group membership) and contrasts involving implicit processing of these distinctions (i.e. passive viewing of stimuli representing group membership). Coordinates for both region-of-interest and whole-brain analyses were included, consistent with prior MKDA approaches ( ;  ,  ;  ). These inclusion criteria resulted in a total of 50 papers in the final database, which together yielded 116 contrasts. See   for PRISMA diagram and   for characteristics of the included studies.\n \n  \nPRISMA diagram summarizing the literature search and study screening, eligibility and inclusion process. \n  \n\n### Data collection \n  \nData extraction was completed by two coders (i.e. the first and third authors), with each coder reviewing all articles separately. Thus, all studies were double-coded and cross-checked to identify discrepancies. If discrepancies were noted, both coders reviewed the article again to determine the accurate data to report. Each article was coded for the following elements: sample size, social cognitive process, stimuli (e.g. still face images and videos), social group (e.g. race, culture, gender and minimal), relational status of the target and reference (i.e. in-group or out-group), and coordinates of peak activation. \n\n\n\n## Data analysis \n  \nMKDA (see   for more information) was implemented through the Matlab toolbox NeuroElf ( ). Consistent with MKDA and neuroimaging meta-analytic procedures ( ;  ;  ), contrast coordinates in Talairach space were first converted to MNI space and then convolved using a smoothing kernel of 12\u2009mm, ultimately producing binary indicator contrast maps. Weights were placed on each study based on the square root of the sample size and whether the study used fixed or random effects. Fixed-effect studies were down-weighted by 0.75 to reduce the influence of those studies. By weighting studies in this manner, MKDA allows for higher-quality (i.e. higher powered and more generalizable) studies to have greater impact on the meta-analytic results ( ). The weighted averages of the kernels across individual study contrasts were used to produce contrast maps based on the proportion of activation near a given voxel from   N   contrasts. This proportion is thresholded by comparing it to a null distribution created through Monte Carlo simulations (5000 samples) that compute the likelihood of finding any activation in any voxel within gray matter (excluding white matter). For all analyses, we set this a priori threshold to a stringent height-based threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (family-wise error-corrected for multiple comparisons) to determine whether voxels were significant. Results thus represent the neural regions displaying the most consistent activation for a given contrast (i.e. \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) when averaged across all studies. \n\nFirst, we investigated the neural reference space of brain regions consistently activated during \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts across all study-level contrasts. Identifying these neural reference spaces allowed us to determine the core set of brain regions consistently associated with in-group   vs   out-group social cognition across the literature, regardless of the social cognitive process or group category studied. To supplement these primary contrasts, we also conducted meta-analytic contrasts in which we contrasted both of the aforementioned sets of contrasts against each other as follows:\n[(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) > (\u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019)] and [(\u2018\u2009>\u2009in-group) > (in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)]. These meta-analytic contrasts allowed us to determine which clusters of activation were relatively more consistent for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 contrasts relative to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts and vice versa. \n\nSecond, we examined the neural correlates of social cognition specifically for contrasts in which race was the social category of distinction. To do so, we investigated the neural reference space for each \u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019 and \u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019 contrast. Again, we supplemented these primary contrasts with meta-analytic contrasts, [(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019) > (\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)], to determine the relative specificity of activation for each contrast. \n\nThird, we examined how consistent differences in neural activation might differ based on the specific social cognitive process engaged. Thus, we investigated the neural reference space for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 by specific social cognitive process. We focus in the main text on empathy and emotion perception, given their prevalence in the literature and importance for predicting biases in behavior ( ;  ;  ). Results for other social cognitive processes are presented in  . \n\nFinally, we examined the neural reference spaces for specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception) specifically within race-based contrasts. Results for other types of social cognition within race-specific contrasts are presented in  . \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nWe first identified the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515\/520 points; 115\/116 contrasts). This analysis revealed consistent activity in the bilateral anterior insula, including a left anterior insula cluster (\u221236, 15, 10;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the claustrum and a right anterior insula cluster (43, 20, 8;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the right inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) and right precentral gyrus. A third cluster was centered in the right dmPFC (8, 47, 27;   k  \u2009=\u2009260), extending into the superior frontal gyrus. \n\nNext, we examined the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515\/520 points; 115\/116 contrasts). Here, we observed one significant cluster of activity, with its peak in the right anterior insula (33, 12, 13;   k  \u2009=\u20093060), extending into the right iFG and precentral gyrus. Thus, both the \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts revealed similar, but distinct, peaks in the anterior insula (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within a cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within a cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

However, \u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019 (358\/520 points; 80\/116 contrasts) revealed two significant clusters of activity: one in left middle frontal gyrus (mFG; 0, 9, 44;   k  \u2009=\u2009119), which extended into the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), and one cluster in right anterior insula (40, 20, 13;   k  \u2009=\u2009123), which extended into the claustrum and iFG (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for overall differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; R\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

The \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 analysis revealed a large swathe of activation in the superior frontal gyrus with its peak in the left dmPFC (0, 49, 32;   k  \u2009=\u2009100), bordering the left anterior medial PFC. The reverse contrast (i.e. \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group empathy\u2019; 64\/520 points; 25\/116 contrasts) showed three significant clusters of activation: one cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; \u221244, 38, 13;   k  \u2009=\u2009256), a second cluster in the left premotor cortex (\u221227, 7, 50;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) and a third cluster in the right precentral gyrus extending into the right supplementary motor area (SMA; 43, 22, 40;   k  \u2009=\u2009250; see  ). \n  \nCoordinates for differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere. All analyses were   k  -threshold corrected at   P\u2009<\u2009  0.001. \n  \n\n#### Emotion perception. \n  \nThere were no significant clusters of activation at   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group emotion perception\u2019 or \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group emotion perception\u2019 (140\/520 points; 21\/116 contrasts). These findings suggest that there were no core regions that consistently showed increased activity during in-group   vs   out-group (and vice versa) emotion perception across studies of social categories. \n\n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \n#### Empathy. \n  \nFinally, we conducted analyses summarizing the neural reference spaces associated with empathy and emotion perception specifically within our subset of racial in-group   vs   out-group contrasts. For \u2018racial in-group empathy\u2009>\u2009racial out-group empathy\u2019 (43\/520 points; 20\/116 contrasts), we found three significant clusters: one in the right dmPFC (7, 30, 34;   k  \u2009=\u2009362), one in the right anterior insula (43, 20, 8;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) and one in the claustrum (\u221223, 20, 6;   k  \u2009=\u2009260). The reverse contrast (\u2018racial out-group empathy\u2009>\u2009racial in-group empathy\u2019; 43\/520 points; 20\/116 contrasts) revealed one significant cluster located in the left mFG (\u221227, 7, 50;   k  \u2009=\u2009260; see   and  ).\n \n  \nCoordinates for differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \n Notes  .

For \u2018racial out-group emotion perception\u2009>\u2009racial in-group emotion perception\u2019 (112\/520 points; 18\/116 contrasts), there was one significant cluster in the right anterior insula (39, 20, 5;   k  \u2009=\u2009206; see   and  ). For written and tabular results for contrasts of other social cognitive processes, see   Results and  . \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we examined the consistency and specificity of neural activation during intergroup social cognition. Results confirmed that there are consistent differences in neural activation during social cognition corresponding to whether the target of such cognition is an in-group   vs   out-group member. Across studies that engaged a variety of social cognitive processes and defined group membership based on diverse social categories, we found more consistent activation in prefrontal cortical regions including the right iFG, precentral gyrus and dmPFC when social cognition was directed at in-group (  vs   out-group) members. Moreover, meta-analytic contrasts indicated that the dmPFC was more consistently activated across study contrasts of \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 compared to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognition. Interestingly, the anterior insula was part of the neural reference space for social cognition regardless of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. However, subsequent meta-analytic contrasts revealed that although the anterior insula was consistently active across both \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts, this region was \u2018more consistently\u2019 activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognitive processing relative to \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 across studies. \n\nOur overall in-group   vs   out-group findings offer some insight into neurocognitive processes that may underlie intergroup social behavior. For example, more consistent dmPFC activation during in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition aligns with behavioral theories, suggesting that individuals are more likely to assign mental states to and act prosocially toward in-group compared to out-group members ( ;  ;  ), as dmPFC activity has been consistently associated with the ability to infer mental states of others ( ;  ;  ) and has been implicated in prosocial behavior ( ;  ). Further, research shows that the ability to simulate the minds of others tends to lead to greater prosocial behavior ( ). Notably, this consistent dmPFC activation for in-group relative to out-group members may seem surprising in light of existing literature suggesting a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, with the dmPFC implicated in social cognitive processing of dissimilar (e.g. out-group) others and the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) implicated in processing of similar (e.g. in-group) others ( ;  ). However, other studies have offered evidence that such ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of the mPFC maybe be task-dependent (see   for a review). Although the present analyses were not specifically intended to test the presence of a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, our results raise further questions about whether this gradient observed for some tasks generalizes across social cognition more broadly. As such, future work should explore this question more directly. Nevertheless, findings of the present study appear consistent with the notion that individuals are more likely to engage in mentalizing for in-group (  vs   out-group) members and that doing so may promote greater prosocial behavior ( ;  ), thus offering a potential neural mechanism underlying in-group favoritism. \n\nOur finding of more consistent anterior insula activation during out-group social cognition also offers insight into the neural mechanisms that may underly out-group biases identified in the behavioral literature. Existing meta-analytic evidence suggests two major functional\u2013anatomic subregions within the anterior insula: the ventral region, shown to be more active during visceral and affective experiences (especially subjective arousal), and the dorsal region, which is more associated with exogenous attention, including salience detection, attention orientation and task performance monitoring ( ;  ,  ,  ). Given these distinctions, one interpretation of the present findings is that out-group social cognition demands more attentional resources relative to in-group social cognition, perhaps because out-group members are more unfamiliar, infrequent or novel. This interpretation also corresponds with previous functional connectivity analyses that have shown evidence of anterior insula laterality during orientating\/arousal and tasks requiring cognitive control. Specifically, right anterior insula has shown stronger connectivity with regions implicated in attentional orientation and arousal (e.g. postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus), while left anterior insula shows stronger connectivity with regions implicated in perspective taking and cognitive motor control (e.g. dmPFC and superior frontal gyrus;  ). Along these lines, the right lateralization of anterior insula for out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group processing may reflect recruitment of attentional resources that results in focus on an individual\u2019s salient out-group status, rather than individuating processes associated with greater medial prefrontal activation. On the other hand, the left lateralization of the anterior insula during in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group processing may facilitate communication with regions involved in perspective taking and mentalizing processes that allow for more individuated perceptions of in-group members. However, such interpretations are made cautiously given evidence, suggesting that functional lateralization of the anterior insula may vary with age, gender and other individual differences, and we were unable to account for these differences in the current analyses ( ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, the \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 anterior insula findings also align with recent neuroimaging work showing that the right anterior insula is involved in integrating information about how others relate to one another in the service of making social group inferences ( ). For instance, in  , predictions about allyship among group members based on latent structure learning of social group coalitions were related to greater activation of the right anterior insula, compared to when predictions of allyship were based solely on similarity between targets. As such, the consistent anterior insula activation observed in our \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts may suggest that, when considering out-group members, people engage in an additional layer of processing that incorporates how members of that out-group relate to other groups but do not engage in this same degree of processing when thinking about in-group members. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   racial out-group \n  \nWe also investigated whether there are consistent neural differences in intergroup social cognition specifically within the social category of race. Interestingly, we did not find any regions consistently activated during racial in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition. However, racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing was associated with more frequent activation of the mFG. We also found consistent anterior insula activation during racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing, mirroring the pattern of activation observed in the overall contrasts (i.e. \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019). A subsequent meta-analytic contrast comparing [(\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019)] revealed a significant cluster of activation in the right anterior insula that also closely mirrored the findings of the overall [(\u2018out-group in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)] meta-analytic contrast, suggesting that the swathe of activation in this region may be associated with out-group processing in general, rather than being specific to racial out-group processing. Alternatively, this finding could be attributable to race being the most frequently investigated social category in the current literature, thus causing race-specific findings to drive an overall meta-analytic effect. \n\nOur failure to identify consistent activation during racial in-group social cognition is interesting and suggests that there is heterogeneity in the brain areas underlying social cognition for racial in-group members across the literature. There were 80 contrasts in our database that addressed this particular question, so our failure to find consistent activation is not likely due to a lack of power. Indeed, a review of the individual contrast maps that contributed to these results revealed that the clusters of activation from individual studies were spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that the null results of these contrasts are driven by true variability in the data rather than due to lack of power. As such, one interpretation of these results is that social cognition for racial in-group members may be so routine that it does not preferentially activate brain regions above and beyond those activated for racial out-group members. In contrast, we did find that social cognitive processing directed at racial out-group individuals consistently elicits increased activity in regions implicated in exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula, mFG and iFG), mirroring findings for out-group members more generally and suggesting some consistency in regions involved in racial out-group social cognition across the literature. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for overall in-group   vs   out-group and racial in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \nFinally, we explored how functional activation during intergroup processing may vary depending on the social cognitive process engaged, focusing specifically on empathy and emotion perception. We found empathy directed at in-group members was associated with more consistent activation in the dmPFC, even when focused specifically on racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy. Among racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy contrasts, we also observed a significant cluster of activation centered on the anterior insula. This cluster was more dorsal, which, in following with the ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of anterior insula functionality ( ;  ), suggests that empathy for in-group members may be more salient or elicit stronger attentional control (compared to out-group). However, these findings are difficult to interpret considering that our earlier results indicated that the anterior insula was more consistently activated in response to out-group members when we collapsed contrasts across all social cognition tasks. Still, this empathy-specific finding might suggest that in-group\/out-group differences in activation of the dorsal anterior insula depend on the particular social cognitive process engaged. Conversely, empathy directed at out-group members was consistently associated with activity in motor (e.g. premotor cortex and precentral gyrus) and executive function areas (e.g. dlPFC and mFG) of the prefrontal cortex, perhaps suggesting that more effortful cognitive control is necessary to engage in empathy for out-group members. \n\nWe also observed differences in neural activation in response to racial in-group   vs   out-group members (although not to in-group   vs   out-group members in general) during emotion perception tasks. Specifically, perceiving emotions of racial in-group members was associated with activation in the amygdala and fusiform, regions that have been well-established in visual emotion perception ( ;  ;  ), while emotion perception directed at racial out-group members was related to consistent anterior insula activation. Interestingly, this cluster was relatively more ventral than those observed in other out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group contrasts. One interpretation of this finding is that it may reflect greater aversive affective responding on the part of perceivers ( ,  ), as perceivers may find emotional racial out-group members to be aversive. Again, these findings related to the activation of the anterior insula in these empathy and emotion perception contrasts remain difficult to interpret and warrant future studies to better understand how the ventral\u2013dorsal anterior insula is operating in in-group   vs   out-group empathy and emotion perception. Nonetheless, these task-specific findings ultimately indicate that the neural correlates of intergroup social cognition do indeed vary depending on the specific social cognitive process engaged. This variation appears to be especially true for affective tasks like empathy and emotion perception, which would explain the inconsistencies noted in the literature regarding insula and dACC activity during in-group   vs   out-group social cognitive processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis work has some limitations. Data were constrained to published fMRI studies; therefore, it is unclear how the present results may be affected by publication bias. Moreover, the race-specific contrasts do not address how neural responding may vary depending on the specific racial groups involved (e.g. Black   vs   White and Asian   vs   Black). Distinguishing among various types of cross-race dyads is an important future direction, as different dynamics (e.g. cultural stereotypes and intergroup histories) exist for different racial\/ethnic group pairings. Furthermore, due to a limited number of eligible studies, we were unable to assess in-group   vs   out-group differences in neural activation across all types of social cognition and social categories, thus leaving unanswered questions about other notable social cognitive processes such as theory of mind and perceptions of trustworthiness. \n\nFinally, while our results may offer insight into neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social behaviors, they are subject to important caveats inherent in any neuroimaging meta-analysis. First, coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses are the gold standard when aggregating across the neuroimaging literature; yet, these techniques rely on functional coordinates derived from contrast analyses but do not incorporate coordinates derived from correlational or functional connectivity analyses, thus limiting the kinds of studies that can be included in the database. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis helps reveal which regions are most consistently active for different social cognitive processes and targets, which may in turn prove useful for future studies using more advanced techniques such as functional connectivity. Second, interpretation of meta-analytic neuroimaging data is subject to reverse inference\u2014inferring cognitive processes from the presence of neural activation ( ). Future studies should follow up on these interpretations using experimental designs that pinpoint brain\u2013behavior links. Finally, our findings do not provide evidence of a causal link between neural activation and subsequent behavior in intergroup contexts. Future research might explore how inducing neural activity in the regions identified here may impact individuals\u2019 behaviors when directed at in-group   vs   out-group members. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe conducted the largest meta-analysis to date of the fMRI literature examining the neural correlates of social cognition across group lines. Our findings align with existing behavioral data and theories on intergroup social phenomena (e.g. in-group favoritism and out-group degradation) and help clarify how the brain gives rise to diverse social cognitive processes, which in turn may manifest as biased social behaviors in intergroup contexts. We hope this work can help guide future research and interventions that address intergroup behavioral dynamics. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8421705,"text_md5":"112310c524b3950dba9ea0643970cdca","field_positions":{"authors":[0,116],"journal":[117,141],"publication_year":[143,147],"title":[158,236],"keywords":[250,307],"abstract":[320,1739],"body":[1748,41812]},"batch":2,"pmid":33760100,"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nsab034","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8421705","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8421705"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8421705\">8421705<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8421705  The neural underpinnings of intergroup social cognition: an fMRI meta-analysis"}

Functional imaging studies investigating those functions in MS patients are hard to compare, as they include heterogeneous patient groups and use different paradigms for cognitive testing. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in neuronal activation between MS patients and healthy controls performing attention and working memory tasks. Two meta-analyses of previously published fMRI studies investigating attention and working memory were conducted for MS patients and healthy controls, respectively. Resulting maps were contrasted to compare brain activation in patients and healthy controls. Significantly increased brain activation in the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was detected for healthy controls. In contrast, higher neuronal activation in MS patients was obtained in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right premotor area. With this meta-analytic approach previous results of investigations examining cognitive function using fMRI are summarized and compared. Therefore a more general view on cognitive dysfunction in this heterogeneous disease is enabled. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized predominantly by demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the brain and the spinal cord. Conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to identify and quantify these lesions. Furthermore, focal demyelination and neuronal loss of gray matter, appearing as partly or entirely cortically located lesions on MRI images as well as structural damage of white and gray matter appearing normal on conventional MRI images are components of the disease ( ). A hallmark of CNS lesions characteristic for MS is disseminations in both space and time. Due to spatially disseminated damage to the CNS, MS results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from motor symptoms to cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits. Disease onset peaks between 22 and 30 years and women are affected approximately twice as often as men ( ). \n\nThe different clinical courses of MS can be categorized into four types based on disease progression ( ): Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) which is characterized by clearly defined relapses with full recovery or sequelae and residual defects. During periods between relapses the disease does not progress clinically. In case this phenotype of the disease is followed by a progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus it is classified as secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In contrast, primary progressive MS (PPMS) takes a progressive course from the beginning with plateaus and temporary minor improvements. The fourth type is progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS), which is progressive from the onset with acute relapses. Between the relapses there is continuing progression. Superimposed relapses may occur in SPMS, whereas in PPMS no acute relapses occur (patients with relapses are then categorized as having PRMS;  ). \n\nAmong the clinical symptoms which affect all types of MS cognitive impairment is the most common symptom with prevalence rates between 43% and 70% significantly contributing to the extent of disability ( ). Memory, attention, processing speed, information processing efficiency, and executive functioning have been shown to be the cognitive capacities that are most frequently impaired ( ). \n\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) has been used to identify brain regions that are on the one hand involved in cognitive functioning in healthy individuals and on the other hand showing altered activation in MS. FMRI studies that explored cognitive processes in MS examined a great variety of functions, such as working memory, attention, and executive functions ( ) using paradigms such as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; e.g.  ), the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test (PVSAT;  ), and the n-Back task (e.g.  ). These abilities were not only examined in behavioral studies, but also using functional imaging to explore the neuronal correlates of impaired performance. \n\nDuring the last years, the number of functional imaging studies rapidly increased as the neuroscience community urged to gain more detailed insight into diseases progression and prognosis, as well as therapeutic options. However, results of these studies are hardly comparable, as typically stimulation paradigms, disease phenotypes, and statistical evaluation of fMRI data show huge variability. Therefore, the current study aimed at providing an overview of previous literature in conjunction with the mapping of functional brain activity related to attention and working memory function in MS patients with high statistical probability performing meta-analyses in order to present a comparison of neuronal activity patterns of MS patients with those of healthy controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nFor this meta-analysis peer-reviewed studies on functional neuroimaging of attention and working memory processes in patients with multiple sclerosis, published in the English language between 1996 and February 2013 were identified. \n\nLiterature research was performed using PubMed, an online database including more than 22 million citations for biomedical literature using the following keywords:   functional MRI  ;   positron emission tomography  ;   multiple sclerosis   (including common abbreviations like   fMRI  ,   PET  , and   MS  ); which were cross-referenced with the search terms   cognition  ;   information processing speed  ;   memory  ;   working memory  ;   executive functions  ;   selective; focused or sustained attention  ; and   attention  . In addition, we used search terms for tasks associated with working memory and attention like n-Back;   Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test  ; and   Paced Visual Serial Addition Test   (including the common acronyms PASAT and PVSAT) as cross-reference. In a second step, the reference lists of the original articles resulting from this search were examined in order to find additional publications that were not identified by the database search. \n\nFor the current meta-analysis the following seven inclusion criteria were specified:   \nStudies must include patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis, studies including patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) with the diagnosis \u201cpossible MS\u201d were excluded. \n  \nIncluded studies had to focus on attention and working memory processes by using auditory or visually presented stimuli. Studies, that used cognitive paradigms investigating attention in conjunction with higher cognitive abilities, such as response inhibition, were excluded. \n  \nThe studies had to examine neuronal activity in working memory and\/or attention tasks with means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). \n  \nAs contrasts used for fMRI or PET analysis we only included direct comparisons between attention or working memory task against a baseline condition for MS patients and healthy controls separately. Comparisons between healthy controls and MS patients without reporting brain activation for each group separately were not included. \n  \nOnly studies reporting coordinates of a whole-brain analysis for patients and healthy controls separately were included. Studies reporting only results of regions of interest (ROI) analyses, volume of interest (VOI) analyses, or small volume correction (SVC) were excluded. Also, studies that reported only correlations of BOLD signal changes with respect to other measures were excluded. \n  \nAll reported results had to be corrected for multiple testing at a significance level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, uncorrected data had to be thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005. \n  \nIncluded coordinates had to be reported in either standard Talairach space or the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. \n  \n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation \n  \nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses ( ), were performed using GingerALE 2.1 ( ). If necessary, neuroanatomical coordinates reported in MNI space were transformed to Talairach space ( ) using icbm2tal transformation ( ) implemented in GingerALE. \n\nThe ALE technique uses peak coordinates reported in functional neuroimaging studies as Gaussian probability distributions. The ALE algorithm is based on random-effects interference and controls for sample size by including the number of subjects in each study into calculation ( ). First, a whole-brain ALE map is created by estimating the likelihood of activation of each voxel. In the next step, the calculated ALE values are tested against the null hypothesis by using permutation testing ( ). The resulting statistical maps are thresholded at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 and corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). In the last step, GingerALE performs a cluster analysis based on the thresholded map with a minimum cluster size of 200\u00a0mm . Separate meta-analyses were performed for patients and healthy controls. Finally, the resulting ALE maps for each group were subtracted from each other. Individual ALE maps were thresholded at a conservative level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FDR corrected), therefore a voxel-level threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 (uncorrected) was used for subtraction analyses to avoid inflating false negative results. To control for inordinate influence of one single study, further meta-analyses were performed, using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. \n\nFor visualization, whole-brain maps of thresholded ALE maps were imported into Multi-image analysis GUI (MANGO;  ) and overlaid onto a standardized anatomical template in Talairach space (colin1.1.nii;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature review \n  \nBased on the systematic review of literature, a total of 42 articles that explored working memory and\/or attention networks in MS using either fMRI or PET were identified. However, only nine studies in total, all using fMRI, fulfilled all inclusion criteria specified in the method section (see  ). These studies provided a total of 158 foci for healthy controls and 201 foci for patients with multiple sclerosis. Six of the included studies used correction for multiple testing at the peak- or cluster-level. The remaining three papers reported uncorrected   p  -value thresholds, the least conservative threshold was   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 uncorrected (one study). \n\nFor visualization of homogeneity of the included studies, all reported foci were presented in Talairach space for healthy controls and MS patients separately ( A and B). \n\n\n### Significant ALE values for working memory and attention in healthy controls \n  \nThe ALE analysis of healthy subjects revealed 17 significant clusters for working memory and attention tasks (  and  ). We found significant ALE scores bilaterally in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, VLPFC). ALE analysis further revealed significant clusters in the frontal eye field and the inferior parietal lobule, two areas responsible for visual attention. Moreover, significant ALE values were obtained in the insular cortex and in the thalamus. \n\n\n### Significant ALE values for working memory and attention in MS patients \n  \nFor MS patients, ALE analysis obtained 24 statistically significant clusters related to working memory and attention tasks (  and  ). Similar to healthy controls, large significant clusters were found in the DLPFC and VLPFC, and in the inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, ALE analysis revealed significant clusters in the superior and middle temporal gyri and in the insular cortex. \n\n\n### Comparison of ALE maps for healthy controls and MS patients \n  \nTo investigate differences between MS patients and healthy controls, we calculated contrasts for the ALE maps of healthy controls versus MS patients and MS patients versus healthy controls. Significant ALE values related to higher likelihood of activation in healthy controls were found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule and the DLPFC as well as in the right VLPFC (  and  ). For the reverse contrast, indicating increased likelihood of activation in MS patients clusters were obtained in the left VLPFC and the right premotor area (  and  ). \n\n\n### Testing of robustness of ALE maps \n  \nDue to the small number of included studies, one single study may influence resulting ALE maps excessively. Therefore, we performed nine additional meta-analyses, removing one single study from the data set. The results of this cross-validation procedure revealed high consistency of significant ALE maps (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this review was to explore differences in brain activation between MS patients and healthy controls induced by working memory and attention tasks using the statistical power of a meta-analytic approach. Results of the ALE meta-analysis revealed the highest likelihood for activation in main attention and working memory related brain areas, such as the DLPFC and VLPFC and the inferior parietal lobule in healthy controls and MS patients. However, we found significantly increased activation bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule and the DLPFC as well as the right VLPFC for healthy controls. In contrast, MS patients showed higher activation in the left VLPFC and the right premotor area. \n\nDomains, typically impaired in MS patients are working memory, information processing speed and executive functions, including attention (for review see  ). Additionally, the neuropsychological assessment of these abilities can easily be implemented in an fMRI setup so that we decided to only include fMRI studies investigating attention and working memory in this ALE meta-analysis. The included studies in MS patients involved fMRI paradigms such as the PASAT and the PVSAT, comprising working memory as well as attention abilities ( ). Although working memory and attention are distinguishable constructs, both processes are highly interactive ( ). It is assumed that attention procedures actively participate in the manipulation and updating of working memory contents (for review see  ). In different subtypes of MS especially PASAT served to detect and observe impairment of working memory and attention which have been identified among other cognitive deficits even at early stages of the disease ( ). With large batteries of neuropsychological tests differences between cognitive impairment in PPMS and RRMS have been presented. Impaired information processing speed, attention, working memory, executive function, and verbal episodic memory have been identified in PPMS whereas in RRMS only information processing speed and working memory were impaired in comparison to healthy controls ( ). Restricted performance in working memory and attention related tasks has been indicated to be significantly associated with lesion load on structural MR images of the brain ( ). \n\nBesides task-based functional imaging studies, patients with MS have increasingly been inspected using resting-state connectivity measures. Recently, systematic alterations of functional connectivity in resting-state networks have been identified in patients with MS. Characteristic modifications of functional connectivity at rest have been identified for the default mode network ( ), as well as for the sensorimotor network ( ), claiming changes already in very early stages of the disease ( ). Specific alterations of functional networks in patients with MS have been hypothesized to serve as an imaging biomarker for different cognitive functions, such as working memory ( ) or attention ( ). \n\nIn this meta-analysis 17 significant ALE clusters were obtained for healthy controls. In contrast, the ALE analysis for MS patients revealed 24 significant clusters. The increased number of ALE clusters among MS patients might be explained by overreaching compensatory mechanisms, which have also been found for cognitive impairments in various diseases, such as major depression ( ) or Alzheimer's disease ( ). The results of this ALE meta-analysis revealed an increased likelihood of activation in the left VLPFC inducing an increased activation of the ventral attention network (VAN) compared to healthy controls, which showed more activation in the dorsal attention network (DAN). Findings of previous studies further point out the involvement of two different neural networks ( ) in attention processes, which cover different components of attention ( ). The dorsal pathway is activated by expectation and anticipation, whereby top-down signals are transmitted to the sensory cortex ( ). In contrast, the ventral system is not pre-activated by expectation but plays an important role in reorienting attention based on new information ( ), reflecting a stimulus-driven bottom-up process (for review see  ). Although both systems cover different aspects of attention, these networks interact in a systematic way ( ). It is assumed that the interaction between the dorsal and the ventral system contributes to some sort of reorienting attention (for review see  ). One reason for poorer performance of MS patients in the PASAT task may be a lack of preparatory expectation, reflected by an increased activation of the VAN in MS patients compared to healthy controls. Expectations based on pre-existing information contribute to simplification of decision by excluding unlikely events ( ). In MS patients, the DAN is less pre-activated by expectation, which may contribute to poorer performance in attention and working memory tasks. \n\nPrevious functional imaging studies revealed right hemisphere lateralization of the ventral pathway in healthy adults ( ). The results of the meta-analysis presented an increased likelihood of activation in the left VLPFC in the MS patient group compared to healthy controls, in which typical right hemisphere dominance was obtained. Atypical brain lateralization of cognitive functions has been detected in several neurological and psychiatric diseases such as autism ( ), schizophrenia ( ), or dyslexia ( ; for review see  ). It has been revealed that also anatomical differences in the human brain may indicate significant functional changes already in the fetus ( ). Atypical lateralization of cognitive function may therefore potentially predict disease progression already in early stages. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nAlthough meta-analyses present a powerful method to calculate the statistical overlap between individual functional imaging studies, all data reducing approaches suffer from inherent drawbacks. The ALE technique, as all other meta-analysis techniques, is unable to assess subtle methodological differences in individual studies, or differences in preprocessing steps. However, it can be assumed that these potential errors do not systematically influence the results of a meta-analysis. In addition, sample size and number of reported foci are included into ALE algorithm ( ), therefore no individual study is able to bias the ALE analysis significantly ( ). It should be recognized that meta-analyses are based upon previously published studies. However, studies without significant results or findings contradictory to the dominating opinion in a specific field of science may never be prepared for publication, what may cause a systematic overestimation of the results. MS patients usually show heterogeneous clinically symptoms, therefore, we defined strict inclusion criteria to create a data set, as homogeneous as possible. As a result, only nine studies fulfilled all criteria. Although the ALE algorithm controls for sample size of single studies and number of reported foci, calculations on a relatively small data set may result in increased influence of one single study on the results of the meta-analysis. Therefore, we monitored the impact of each study using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, in which no dominance of one single study was evident. \n\nMultiple sclerosis is a complex and multi-layered disease with various disease specific influencing factors, such as age, disease type, and duration or type of medication, resulting in very inhomogeneous patient groups. Especially the age and the disease duration are correlated with the type of disease, as the SPMS type requires a longer duration until the onset of disease until it can be diagnosed. Therefore, generalized conclusions regarding disease progression based on findings of functional imaging studies are difficult. It has been shown that different aspects of cognition are impaired in different subtypes of MS ( ). Combining the results of studies including different phenotypes of MS is necessary in order to be able to analyze data cumulatively. FMRI data acquired in RRMS, RPMS, and SPMS were combined in the original studies as well as in our meta-analysis at the cost of sensitivity to differences in activation between these phenotypes. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nIn multiple sclerosis the exact diagnosis, especially in early stages of the disease is challenging. Therefore the acquisition and combination of different indicators, such as lesion load, functional and structural information is of huge importance. However, in MS patient groups are typically inhomogeneous with respect to age, disease duration, or type of disease, therefore the development of new functional or structural biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression is complicated. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize previous results of working memory and attention abilities in patients with MS to enable a general view on cognitive dysfunction in this disease. To gain more detailed insight into differences between disease subtypes concerning cognitive impairment and cognition related brain activation, studies including large patient groups of different subtypes are required. Furthermore, the resulting ALE maps will be provided online ( ), and can be used as masks for further ROI analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of interest \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest in relation to this manuscript. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":3878376,"text_md5":"47c578895a4a0715781087595f7091fe","field_positions":{"authors":[0,93],"journal":[94,115],"publication_year":[117,121],"title":[132,270],"keywords":[284,406],"abstract":[419,1990],"body":[1999,22981]},"batch":2,"pmid":24056084,"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2013.09.005","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3878376","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3878376"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3878376\">3878376<\/a>","list_title":"PMC3878376  Altered likelihood of brain activation in attention and working memory networks in patients with multiple sclerosis: An ALE meta-analysis\u2606"}

Many resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have identified abnormal spontaneous low-frequency brain activity in ESRD dialysis patients. However, these studies have reported inconsistent results. So far, no meta-analyses on this topic have been published. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the more consistently vulnerable brain regions in ESRD patients at rest and to reveal its possible neuropathophysiological mechanisms. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline, and EMBASE databases up to July 20, 2022 based on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). Brain regions with abnormal spontaneous neural activity in ESRD compared to healthy controls (HCs) from previous studies were integrated and analyzed using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method. Jackknife sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the reproducibility of the results. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn total, 11 studies (380 patients and 351 HCs) were included in the final analysis. According to the results of the meta-analysis, compared with HCs, ESRD patients had decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the right precuneus, right cuneus, and left superior temporal gyrus (STG), while no brain regions with increased brain activity were identified. Jackknife sensitivity analysis showed that our results were highly reliable. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCompared to HCs, ESRD dialysis patients exhibit significant abnormalities in spontaneous neural activity associated with CI, occurring primarily in the default mode network, visual recognition network (VRN), and executive control network (ECN). This contributes to the understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \n[ ], identifier [CRD42022348694]. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA common comorbidity of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is cognitive impairment (CI). CI is a deterioration of cognitive function beyond that expected with normal aging and is usually acquired and progressive ( ). Poorer cognitive function may reduce quality of survival and treatment adherence, increase health care costs, morbidity, and mortality ( ). Many studies have shown that the prevalence of CI is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in the general population and is more common in patients with ESRD, including varying degrees of impairment in perception, memory, attention, and motor function ( ;  ). According to  , up to 70% of patients on dialysis have moderate to severe CI at no less than 55 years of age, three times more than controls of the same age ( ). Currently, the pathogenesis of CI in ESRD patients is unclear. Moreover, its diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging examinations, and there is a lack of reliable and objective biological markers. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the exact pathophysiological mechanisms. \n\nIn previous studies, ESRD patients had poorer cognitive test scores compared to the general population ( ). Neuroimaging studies had found alterations in brain structure and local neurological function in ESRD. For example, previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies had found that ESRD patients presented with more severe brain atrophy ( ), significantly reduced brain gray matter volume ( ), cortical thinning ( ;  ), and decreased white matter integrity ( ;  ) compared to healthy controls (HCs), all of which are associated with CI ( ). In addition, different analyses such as positron emission tomography (PET) ( ) and arterial spin-labeled (ASL) imaging ( ) had also identified hemodynamic, metabolic, and functional alterations in specific brain regions in ESRD patients. \n\nIn recent years, functional MRI has developed rapidly and has become an important aid in diagnosing brain function. Task-state functional MRI has differences in experimental design, patient cooperation, and the task itself, which can easily lead to heterogeneity ( ;  ). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to explore brain function in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders due to its non-invasive and task-free features, providing a new perspective on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CI in ESRD patients ( ). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) is a common data analysis method for rs-fMRI and is commonly used to detect spontaneous brain activity when subjects are not performing a task. The ALFF is a measure of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations in a specific low frequency range (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) based on voxel levels, which can respond to the strength of local neuronal activity ( ). The fALFF serves as a standardized index of ALFF, which reduces the effect of physiological noise and has higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activity on low-frequency amplitude signals of neurons, but is less reliable than ALFF ( ). Nowadays, rs-fMRI is used in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( ;  ), depression ( ), Parkinson\u2019s disease ( ), and epilepsy ( ). Several previous studies have used ALFF\/fALFF to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of ESRD and have found abnormal spontaneous brain activity in a wide range of brain regions. These include precuneus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), parietal lobe ( ;  ;  ), posterior cingulate cortex ( ;  ), medial prefrontal cortex ( ;  ), occipital lobe ( ;  ), angular gyrus ( ;  ;  ), cuneus ( ;  ;  ), and others. However, these findings report a wide variety of brain regions. \n\nConsidering the above findings of ALFF\/fALFF and the inconsistent results of the studies, we conducted a study using the most common meta-analysis method in the field of brain imaging, ALE meta-analysis, aiming to identify reliable neuroimaging markers and possible pathophysiological mechanisms by performing a comprehensive analysis of abnormal brain regions in ESRD patients identified in previous studies using ALFF\/fALFF methods. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nOur study followed the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiological (MOOSE) guideline ( ) and had been pre-registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022348694). \n\n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nA comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for studies from inception until July 2022 that reported altered brain activation in patients with ESRD using the ALFF\/fALFF method was conducted. The following keywords were used: (\u201cresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201crs-fMRI\u201d OR \u201camplitude of low-frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cALFF\u201d OR \u201cfractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation\u201d OR \u201cfALFF\u201d); AND \u201ccognitive impairment\u201d or \u201cCI\u201d; AND \u201cend-stage renal disease\u201d OR \u201cESRD\u201d OR \u201cdialysis\u201d. To prevent omissions, the citations of review articles and included studies were manually searched to identify additional articles. \n\nStudies were included in this meta-analysis if they (1) met the diagnostic criteria for ESRD ( ); (2) maintained on dialysis for \u22653 months; (3) compared the ALFF\/fALFF between ESRD and HCs; (4) reported three-dimensional coordinates [Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach] of the whole brain. This meta-analysis excluded studies with the following conditions: (1) age < 18 years; (2) research based on other disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, etc., and (3) review articles, case reports, letters, conference abstracts, and editorials. Two reviewers (HC and FL) independently completed the literature search and screening process to determine the final inclusion in the meta-analysis. Where there were disagreements between reviewers, these were resolved by a consensus reviewer (XF). \n\n\n### Date extraction \n  \nThe two reviewers (HC and FL) independently extracted and summarized the required information from the included studies. Data collected include study and subject characteristics [name of the first author, year of publication, the sample size of subjects, mean age, male\/female ratio, duration of dialysis, education level, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores], imaging characteristics [method of analysis, peak coordinates of activated brain regions (Foci), three-dimensional coordinates (MNI\/Talairach), scanner field strength and analysis software]. \n\n\n### Assessment of methodological quality \n  \nIndependent reviewers (HC and FL) used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) ( ) to assess the quality and risk of bias of the included literature. The NOS has three dimensions (choice, comparability, and exposure), with eight entries and a total score of nine. If there were differences between reviewers, consensus reviewers (XF) would discuss them together to resolve these differences. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nA total of 100 foci were reported in 11 trials involving 671 participants in this meta-analysis. The results of comparing ESRD and HCs were divided into two groups based on increased and decreased ALFF\/fALFF: (a) ESRD: increased ALFF\/fALFF (5 experiments; 10 foci); (b) ESRD: decreased ALFF\/fALFF (11 experiments; 90 foci). This study followed the latest recommendations for ALE meta-analysis using GingerALE version 3.0.2  ( ). The ALE method used activation likelihood as an indicator to calculate the likelihood of activation across experiments for each voxel and to test hypotheses on these likelihoods to obtain consistency of brain activation across multiple experiments. First, the stereotactic coordinates (X, Y, and Z) of the studies included in the meta-analysis were extracted, and the extracted coordinates were the brain coordinates that underwent changes in dialysis ESRD compared to HCs. To ensure that all coordinates were in the same coordinate system when analyzed, all Talairach coordinates were converted to MNI coordinates using the GingerALE converter foci tool ( ). Then, all the foci and basic information were sorted into two text files. These files were imported into the software to read the foci. According to the recommendations of  , cluster-level corrected family-wise error (FWE) at   p   < 0.05, cluster-forming threshold at   p   < 0.001, and 5,000 permutations were used to calculate the ALE diagram. To better present the results of the result, we used the Mango software  to present the results into a standard template (Colin27_T1_seg_MNI) ( ). \n\nIn addition, Jackknife sensitive analysis was used to assess the robustness of the results of the meta-analysis, excluding one dataset at a time ( ;  ). After excluding one study at a time, the data from the remaining studies were subjected to a repeated ALE meta-analysis using GingerALE 3.0.2 software. In general, we considered the result to be highly replicable if a brain region remained significant in most (>50%) of the study combinations ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \n showed the literature screening process and results. In total, 456 studies were identified by the search strategy described, 153 studies were excluded because of duplication, and 257 studies were excluded for titles and abstracts. We screened the remaining 46 studies and further excluded 35 studies for the following reasons: not in the area of interest (  n   = 15), age < 18 years (  n   = 1), coordinates unavailable (  n   = 1), based on local or specific brain regions (  n   = 1), other data analysis methods, such as regional homogeneity (ReHo) (  n   = 3) and functional connectivity (FC) (  n   = 14). Finally, 11 studies including 671 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. \n  \nFlow diagram of article selection. ReHo, regional homogeneity; FC, functional connectivity. \n  \n\n### Characteristics and quality assessment \n  \n summarized the demographic, imaging characteristics and quality scores of all studies included in the meta-analysis. ESRD patients and HCs in each of the included studies were matched by age, gender, and education. In this included studies, 345 patients with ESRD (131 females and 214 males, mean age 42.4 years) and 326 HCs (142 females and 184 males, mean age 41.56 years) were reported. All studies underwent whole brain-based ALFF\/fALFF analysis (ESRD > HCs: five experiments, 10 Fico; ESRD < HCs: 11 experiments, 90 Foci). In total, 9 of the 11 studies used a 3.0 T scanner for data collection and the remaining two studies were conducted on a 1.5 T scanner. All studies included in the meta-analysis had a quality score of \u22658, indicating that the overall quality of these studies was high. A specific assessment of the risk of bias for each of the included studies is shown in  . \n  \nDemographic and imaging characteristics and quality scores of all studies included in the meta-analysis. \n      \nSummary of risk of bias for included studies according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis results \n  \nAs shown in  , according to the results of the ALE meta-analysis, ESRD patients had decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the right precuneus (Brodmann area 19, BA 19), right cuneus (BA 7), and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) (BA 39) compared to HCs, while no brain regions with increased ALFF\/fALFF were identified.   showed the coordinates of the cluster maximums. \n  \nThe results of the meta-analysis of all 11 datasets compared the differences between ESRD dialysis patients and HCs.

Of these, the decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the right precuneus was the most reliable and replicable in all 11 datasets. The right cuneus and left STG were also highly replicable, as they were significant in 10 and 8 datasets, respectively. \n  \nJackknife sensitivity analyses. \n    \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we used an ALE meta-analysis to explore changes in abnormal neuronal activity in ESRD compared to HCs. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis on such topics has been published. The abnormal brain neuronal activity identified in the meta-analysis mainly involved the default mode network (DMN) (right precuneus), the visual recognition network (VRN) (right cuneus), and the executive control network (ECN) (left STG). Jackknife sensitivity analyses found these results to be highly reliable and not driven by individual studies. Overall, the changes in specific brain regions analyzed in this study are valuable in helping us to uncover possible neural mechanisms of CI in ESRD dialysis patients. \n\nOur meta-analysis showed that ALFF\/fALFF was decreased in the right precuneus, right cuneus, and left STG in the patient group compared with HCs. However, no brain regions with increased ALFF\/fALFF were found. This is consistent with previous findings from studies of ESRD patients ( ;  ). Decreased ALFF\/fALFF reflects diminished spontaneous activity of brain neurons and impaired brain function, while increased ALFF\/fALFF may be a compensatory mechanism ( ). A growing number of studies suggested that CI in ESRD patients may be associated with disrupted connectivity in the DMN. The DMN is associated with spontaneous cognitive functions, external environmental monitoring functions, and internal mental activity and is the most widely studied resting-state subnetwork in ESRD patients, including the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, and lateral temporal cortex ( ;  ). These regions are usually more active when the brain is in resting state but will deactivate when performing tasks, corresponding to brain regions showing negative activation. \n\nThe precuneus, located on the medial aspect of the parietal lobe, is a key node in the DMN and plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes. Functionally, it is closely associated mainly with memory, emotion, and visuospatial executive functions ( ). A graph theory-based analysis pointed out that impaired function of the DMN may underlie CI in ESRD, and further correlation analysis showed that function of the precuneus in ESRD patients correlated with cognitive performance ( ). This finding was confirmed in the present study. An ASL imaging performed by   demonstrated a widespread decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in dialysis patients compared to non-dialysis patients. To our knowledge, atrophy of the gray matter cortex of the brain is associated with lower CBF, which can lead to memory deficits and CI ( ). The study also found a consistent reduction in precuneus ReHo values in ESRD patients and a positive correlation with digit symbol test scores ( ). This resonates with our study and suggests that decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the precuneus may be a potentially promising biomarker for predicting CI in ESRD patients. \n\nThe cuneus is located in the occipital lobe of the brain and is an important part of the VRN, with the main functions involving the processing of visual information, facial perception, emotion, and working memory ( ;  ). Abnormal FC in the cuneus has been shown to be associated with altered brain activity in ESRD patients ( ). Previous studies have also shown widespread impairment of the VRN in ESRD dialysis patients ( ). In addition,   showed decreased ALFF in the bilateral cuneus based on rs-fMRI analysis. All of these suggest that dysfunction in the cuneus may cause slowed integration of visual information processing and working memory. However, it is noteworthy that studies using nodal centrality analysis found significant activation of the cuneus in ESRD patients ( ). These inconsistent results may be related to the severity of the patients\u2019 disease, small sample sizes, and different study methods. \n\nIn addition, our meta-analysis found decreased low-frequency brain activity in the left STG. The STG is part of the auditory language center, as well as the ECN. This network is involved in several higher cognitive tasks and has a significant role in attention allocation, goal-directed behavior, and control of emotions ( ). It has been shown that FC in the ECN is associated with substance-dependent approach behavior and that approach behavior is stronger in the left-sided ECN in the resting state ( ). This is consistent with our findings. In an F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET study,   found reduced perfusion in the STG and significantly reduced cerebral metabolism in ESRD patients. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),   observed lower fractional anisotropy in depression-related regions (STG) in older adults and ESRD dialysis patients than in HCs. To our knowledge, the prevalence of depression among ESRD patients is as high as 12\u201352% ( ). Previous studies have also shown that disruption of FC in the STG is associated with multiple psychological disorders, including depression ( ). As we hypothesized, each of these findings could partially explain cognitive dysfunction in ESRD dialysis patients, for example, memory, balance, and emotional processing. Therefore, we presume that a decreased ALFF\/fALFF in the STG may be a sign of mental impairment in ESRD dialysis patients. \n\nIn this study, we only found positive results for decreased ALFF\/fALFF and did not find positive results for increased ALFF\/fALFF. However, many single studies have been performed showing that ESRD patients present with common brain abnormalities, such as the increased ALFF\/fALFF in the right precentral gyrus ( ;  ). Yet, no positive results for it were found in our meta-analysis. This may be due to the limitations of the ALE meta-analysis. ALE meta-analysis as a probabilistic analysis can effectively eliminate false positive results and avoid the problem of low statistical test power in individual imaging studies, but it is difficult to avoid false negative results ( ). In addition, only five trials and 10 foci from our meta-analysis were included in the analysis of increased ALFF\/fALFF. A small number of coordinates may not have reached the threshold. These may lead to a decreased accuracy of the results. On the other hand, this may also be related to the influence of confounding factors such as gender, age, and education level of the study. \n\nIn the present study, we only analyzed ALFF\/fALFF studies in ESRD patients, excluding other imaging studies such as ReHo, DTI, and FC, which to some extent reduces the bias of the results due to the combination of rs-fMRI with other analysis methods. Nevertheless, this study still has some limitations. First, our dataset was limited in number (11 studies) and some results should still be interpreted with caution. Second, our meta-analysis was unable to determine the causal relationship between ESRD and abnormal brain activity. This was due to the fact that the studies we included were cross-sectional studies. Third, the studies included in our meta-analysis were all from Asian countries and may be limited by the application of other national populations. Fourth, owing to insufficient data from relevant studies, we only analyzed ESRD patients on dialysis and did not perform a meta-analysis of dialysis modalities. Finally, because the ALE meta-analysis method did not consider the intensity of activation, it was possible that some brain regions with low activation levels were ignored. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, using the ALE method, the current meta-analysis shows that in the resting state, ESRD dialysis patients have abnormal spontaneous low-frequency brain activity compared to HCs, mainly involving the DMN, VRN, and ECN. These findings may be potential imaging biomarkers of CI in ESRD dialysis patients and could be considered as a focus of attention for follow-up studies. Meanwhile, more in-depth studies are needed in the future to validate our results and explore more specific biomarkers of early stage of CI in ESRD dialysis patients. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article\/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nHC and FL drafted and revised the manuscript critically for important intellectual content, contributed to the search of the literature, the collection of relevant information, and the data analysis.

In this study, we reviewed the main experimental paradigms and made a cognitive-oriented meta-analysis of fMRI studies of human navigation to underline the importance of the experimental designs and cognitive tasks used to assess navigational skills. We performed a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 66 fMRI experiments to identify the neural substrates underpinning general aspects of human navigation. Four individual ALE analyses were performed to identify the neural substrates of different experimental paradigms (i.e., familiar vs. recently learned environments) and different navigational strategies (allocentric vs. egocentric). Results of the general ALE analysis highlighted a wide network of areas with clusters in the occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal lobes, especially in the parahippocampal cortex. Familiar environments seem to be processed by an extended temporal-frontal network, whereas recently learned environments require activation in the parahippocampal cortex and the parietal and occipital lobes. Allocentric strategy is subtended by the same areas as egocentric strategy, but the latter elicits greater activation in the right precuneus, middle occipital lobe and angular gyrus. Our results suggest that different neural correlates are involved in recalling a well-learned or recently acquired environment and that different networks of areas subtend egocentric and allocentric strategies. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007\/s11065-014-9247-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn the past 20\u00a0years, an increasing number of studies in the cognitive neuroscience literature have analyzed human ability to navigate and orient in recently learned and familiar environments by investigating the cognitive processes involved in successful navigation. The latter include the ability to retain the spatial layout of an environment, find a shortcut between two locations or create an interconnected network among different paths. \n\nThe data reported in these studies are often contrasting, perhaps because of differences in methods and in the specific cognitive processes investigated in the experimental paradigms. In this light, a methodological review with a meta-analytic approach could be useful to bridge the gap in the literature regarding the neural correlates of human navigation. On one side, a methodological review allows highlighting the main cognitive variables across fMRI studies; on the other side, a meta-analytic approach makes it possible to analyze the role of these variables by integrating data from several studies to identify brain areas that show a consistent response across studies and experimental variables. \n\nThe first step is to identify the main differences in the paradigms used in fMRI studies of human navigation. One of the most obvious differences is familiarity with the environment in which the participants have to navigate. In some studies, participants are presented with environments they have been very familiar with for years (Maguire et al.  ; Nemmi et al.  ). In other studies, they are exposed to the environment just before the experimental test (Berthoz  ) or during the study (Iaria et al.  ). In any case, successful navigation of both humans and animals depends on memories of the environment, that is, the degree of familiarity and the time lapse between the learning phase and recall. Montello ( ) reported that environments which are well known and familiar are more likely to be represented in a survey format (similar to cognitive maps) and that the format of representation, which influences the style of navigation, changes with degree of familiarity. Iaria et al. ( ) showed that learning a virtual environment activates different hippocampal areas than those activated during recall when learning is fully established. Furthermore, studies of other types of memory (i.e., episodic memory) have shown that areas involved in the recall of less familiar items (i.e., items that have been recently learned) are slightly different from those involved in the recall of very familiar items that have already been recalled several times (Henke  ; Carr et al.  ). Thus, it is very likely that the variations in brain activities observed in different studies of spatial navigation are linked to the different degree of familiarity (i.e. very familiar vs. recently learned) participants have with experimental environments. Another main difference between experimental paradigms is the type of environmental representation (egocentric vs. allocentric) elicited by the experimental task. When using egocentric representations, participants locate environmental items by referring to their own position (e.g., the door is on my left, the window is behind me on the right, etc.). Instead, in allocentric representation the position of the item is not linked to that of the participants (e.g., the door is northwest, the window is 5\u00b0 south, etc.). \n\nOnce the main methodological axis in the spatial navigation literature has been identified, the second step (which is central to the current study) is to verify converging and consistent evidence in the current literature by means of a meta-analysis, integrating data from several studies. This will allow assessing the role of the main methodological variables of fMRI studies, overcoming the limitations of the single study approach, such as small sample size, low reliability and logical subtraction, which is sensitive only to differences between conditions. \n\nFirst, we will review the fMRI studies within a theoretical framework that takes into account a) degree of familiarity with the environments and b) types of environmental representations and navigational strategies required by the experimental task. Then, we will carry out a meta-analysis on fMRI studies of human navigation using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) (Eickhoff et al.  ) to verify involvement of the neural network identified in the review and differences related to the previously identified methodological variables. \n\nThe main aims of the meta-analysis were the following: (i) to find converging evidence of a specific and dedicated network for spatial navigation in the human brain, to overcome the discrepancies found in neuroimaging studies of human navigation; (ii) to test the hypothesis that well-learned, familiar environments and recently learned environments are processed by different neural substrates; and (iii) to assess the degree of overlap between the brain networks that mediate the egocentric and allocentric strategies employed in navigation. \n\n\n## Paradigm: Navigating in Recently Learned and Familiar Environments \n  \nNeuroimaging studies of human navigation can be roughly divided into studies that focus on recently learned environments, that is, environments learned for experimental purposes (e.g. a university campus or a virtual environment) (Janzen and van Turennout  ; Janzen and Weststeijn  ; Janzen and Jansen  ; Iaria et al.  ,  ,  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ) and studies that require participants to perform experimental tasks in familiar environments (Rosenbaum et al.  ,  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ; Ino et al.  ). In the first type of paradigm (hereafter called the RL paradigm), the aim is to understand the neural basis of coding, storing and use of navigational knowledge. A good example of the RL paradigm is Iaria and colleagues\u2019 study using the Cognitive Map Test (Iaria et al.  ). These authors created a virtual environment that permitted good control over stimulation and allowed studying both learning and retrieval. The environment consisted of several buildings of different sizes and shapes and six clearly identifiable landmarks. The participants moved in the virtual environment by using a three-button keypad; each button corresponded to a different direction of movement. Latini-Corazzini et al. ( ) also used an RL environmental paradigm and developed a virtual reality task in which participants navigated to acquire the knowledge necessary to carry out the subsequent spatial tasks. In this case, the main environment was a small virtual town with a regular grid of streets and 21 buildings, most of which had no distinctive features. Nine buildings had specific signs (hotel, bank, etc.). In the practice phase participants could freely explore the town, but in the encoding phase they could only move along a defined route. Using an RL paradigm, Baumann et al. ( ) created a virtual \u201carena\u201d consisting of an infinite plain. The arena contained four objects: three cylinders of different colors (landmarks) and one yellow pyramid (target). The pyramid had a virtual \u2018light beacon\u2019, which projected vertically from the apex and signaled the pyramid\u2019s position when it was occluded by the landmarks. During the encoding phase, each participant had to navigate toward the target and remember its spatial position with respect to the three landmarks. \n\nAt variance with the RL paradigm, in some studies the environments used in the experimental tasks are already familiar to participants. In these studies (hereafter called the familiar (F) paradigm), the aim is to explore the recall and use of navigational knowledge. Spiers and Maguire\u2019s ( ) \u201ctaxi-driver-task\u201d is a very good example of an F paradigm. It presents novel tasks to participants who have gained thorough knowledge of the experimental environment over a long period of time. These authors used a virtual reproduction of London to assess the previously acquired spatial knowledge of taxi drivers, who had gotten their license by demonstrating good knowledge of the city. Rosenbaum and colleagues (Rosenbaum et al.  ,  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ) carried out two studies involving mental navigation in the city of Toronto. Nemmi et al. ( ) asked participants who had lived in Rome for at least 5\u00a0years and had demonstrated good familiarity with the city centre to indicate whether three landmarks were shown in correct order along a route. Ino et al. ( ) tested participants who were very familiar with Kyoto City and during the fMRI asked them to mentally navigate from one place (named by the experimenter) to another. \n\nIt is noteworthy that in the only study which directly contrasted remote and recent learning of navigational information (Hirshhorn et al.  ) the hippocampal formation was activated only for recently acquired spatial knowledge and the extra-hippocampal structures (i.e. parahippocampal cortex, lingual gyrus and precuneus) were engaged in the recall of remote spatial knowledge. \n\nThe debate over the role of increasing familiarity in both behavioral and neuroimaging data is related to the debate over the role of the hippocampus in declarative episodic memory and the contrasting findings in patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia (Milner  ; Bohbot and Corkin  ). As in other forms of declarative memory, spatial memory seems to be compromised in patients with MTL lesions, but not all memories seem impaired to the same extent. Although it is widely recognized that patients with hippocampal and MTL damage cannot learn to navigate in a novel environment, there is evidence that they are usually able to navigate in environments learned before the damage (Habib and Sirigu  ; Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). This mirrors the well-known dissociation between new and old episodic memory in amnesic patients (Milner  ), which is compatible with different longstanding theories about the hippocampal role: the declarative theory (Tulving  ), the Standard model of memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez  ) and the multiple trace theory (Moscovitch et al.  ; Moscovitch et al.  .). All of these models propose that some memories might survive hippocampal damage but they differ in the mechanism supposed to explain this survival. The declarative theory hypothesizes that the hippocampus is necessary only in the formation of episodic and spatial memories and that its role is time-limited because it is linked to the fixation of memories that will be stored in neo-cortical areas. The Standard model of memory consolidation proposed a gradual reorganization within long-term memory storage so that, as time passes after learning, the importance of the hippocampal formation gradually diminishes accordingly to the increasing of memory consolidation until a permanent memory trace develops which is independent from this region. By contrast, the multiple trace theory hypothesizes that a new trace is formed in the hippocampus every time a certain memory is recollected, so that older memories become more resistant to hippocampal damage or become semantic and independent from the hippocampus. According to the authors who support these theories, spatial memory and its failure following hippocampal damage is a valid model for studying the more general system of episodic memory. \n\nThe claim that old memories of familiar environments are retained in MTL-damaged patients who show impaired recall of recently acquired environments and are unable to learn totally new ones has been challenged (Nadel and Moscovitch  ) and some studies have shown that hippocampal activity is not limited to the recall of recently learned environments (Niki and Luo  ). Therefore, another aspect that remains controversial is the role of the hippocampus in remembering very familiar environments or spatial memories acquired in the distant past and often recollected. A study brining evidences in favor of the persisting of highly familiar spatial representation in spite of hippocampal damage is the one by Maguire et al. ( ), who showed that a taxi driver after extensive bilateral hippocampal damage retained the ability to navigate in a virtual reconstruction of the city of London. Since he was able to navigate by means of the main or principal routes but not using minor routes, the author concluded that a \u201csketch map\u201d of an environment (i.e. a semantic type of spatial memory, opposed to an episodic one) could be remembered without hippocampal involvement (Maguire et al.  ). \n\nAnyway the relationship between hippocampus and familiarity of the spatial representations has been somewhat neglected in the functional literature and only a few studies have directly compared old and recent spatial memories (Niki and Luo  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ; Maguire et al.  ) and have reported contrasting evidence. Starting from the above-described theoretical framework, a meta-analytic approach, assessing the consistence of the neural response across studies and experimental variables would clarify the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. \n\n\n## Spatial Strategies: Egocentric and Allocentric Representations \n  \nNeuroimaging studies on spatial navigation can also be separated according to the type of representation participants have to retrieve to perform the task. As stated above, we chose to focus on egocentric (ego) and allocentric (allo) spatial representations. \n\nNeuroimaging studies focusing on egocentric navigation can be divided into those assessing \u201coffline\u201d spatial egocentric memories and those assessing \u201conline\u201d egocentric-based navigation in real or virtual environments (Wolbers and Hegarty  ). The first type of task requires participants to judge the order of two landmarks along a street (Rosenbaum et al.  ), to recognize or recall landmark appearance (Janzen et al.  ) or to judge whether a certain landmark was or was not along a certain route (Nemmi et al.  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ). The second type of task includes those requiring navigation along habitual routes in real familiar environments by means of mental imagery (Ino et al.  ) or following trails or arrows along the route (i.e., so-called \u201croute following\u201d; Hartley et al.  ). \n\nBy contrast, tasks assessing allocentric-based navigation are usually carried out in virtual environments in which participants have to navigate from a starting point to a goal in a condition that does not allow following the usual route because, for example, it is blocked (Iaria et al.  ; Rosenbaum et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ). Although this hypothesis has been questioned (Maguire et al.  ), it is believed that the presence of a blocked route forces participants to access the cognitive map of the environment to \u201cfind\u201d a novel path (Iaria et al.  ,  ). Another way to force participants to use an allocentric representation is to ask them to \u201cfind\u201d a shortcut between two locations so they will not repeat the route they have learned (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ). \n\nThe above mentioned Cognitive Map Test (Iaria et al.  ) is a paradigmatic allocentric task. It contains several crossroads and represents a city in which all buildings, except six landmarks, have the same texture. According to the authors, this task taps on the formation and use of a cognitive map, because participants are required to navigate from one landmark to another using the shortest path. Thus, to plan a novel path they have to recall a cognitive map. Iaria et al. ( ) found clear activation of the hippocampal formation: anterior regions were more active when participants were acquiring the allocentric representation of the virtual city and posterior regions were more active when they used the learned representation. \n\nNovel learning of a new environment is not necessarily related to allocentric encoding. According to Montello ( ), the type of encoding and the specific representation recalled depend on the task requirements. Latini-Corazzini et al. ( ) presented a virtual environment similar to the one used by Iaria et al. ( ). After the learning phase, they asked participants to perform a \u201croute\u201d task and a \u201csurvey\u201d task. In the route task, participants were required to follow a route and indicate which direction the path took at various crossing points. In the survey task, they had to indicate the direction in which a certain landmark (not immediately visible) was located with respect to a certain point on the route. To accomplish the first task, participants had to recall an egocentric representation of the route based on the direction of the path; to correctly perform the second task, they had to recall a survey representation of the environment by storing the geometrical configuration of each landmark. \n\nTo differentiate between egocentric and allocentric representations of the environment, Hartley et al. ( ) presented participants with two environments and asked them to learn one environment by following arrows that were visible along a path (egocentric task) and to learn the other one by freely exploring it (allocentric task). During the recall phase, participants accessed an egocentric representation in the first environment and an allocentric (presumably survey) representation in the second environment. \n\nMaguire and colleagues (Maguire et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ) focused on tasks that required accessing the allocentric representation of known environments in their \u201ctaxi driver task\u201d. In this task, participants had to take a passenger to a specific location, usually by avoiding some streets or having to change destination in the middle of the path. Being forced to change the habitual route should force participants to use a survey representation of the environment rather than an egocentric representation of habitual routes. \n\nEgocentric and allocentric knowledge can also be tested by so-called mental navigation. In mental navigation tasks, participants have to use visual mental imagery. For example, to test both egocentric and allocentric representations Rosenbaum et al. ( ,  ) and Hirshhorn et al. ( ) asked participants to mentally navigate in a very familiar environment. In tasks tapping egocentric representations, participants have to judge the correctness of a sequence of landmarks along a route to determine which of two landmarks is closest to them or mentally navigate a familiar route while naming the streets encountered along the path. In tasks tapping allocentric representations, participants have to judge which of two landmarks is closest to a third landmark specified in the instructions or to mentally navigate along blocked routes naming all the streets crossed by the path. \n\nFrom a neural point of view, many studies have shown that egocentric navigation is subserved by an ensemble of areas related to landmark knowledge (i.e., parahippocampal place area, Epstein and Ward  ), egocentric spatial representation in the parietal cortex (i.e., precuneus and cuneus, inferior parietal lobe) and heading vectors possibly coded by head-direction cells in the retrosplenial cortex. Instead, allocentric navigation seems mainly related to the hippocampal cortex (Tolman  ; O\u2019Keefe and Nadel  ; Maguire et al.  ) and, more specifically, to a network of areas containing place cells (hippocampus) and grid cells (entorhinal cortex). Additional hypothetical cells, namely boundary vector cells and head-direction cells, which should be located in the retrosplenial complex, have been included in models of human navigation, such as in the BBB model (Byrne and Becker  ). It is believed that these structures, and the cell populations within them, interact to update the participant\u2019s current position in space by calculating the heading vector towards the navigational goal and planning the shortest or most feasible route to reach the goal (Byrne and Becker  ). Head-direction cells were found in the cortex of rodents (Taube et al.  ) and areas coding for head direction have been described in parietal lobe in humans in some papers (see for example, Schindler and Bartels  ). However, a clear localization of neural correlates of head direction cells in humans as well as the understanding of their role in human navigation are still matter of debate, also due to the fact that the impossibility to move the heads during fMRI scan significantly reduces the possibility to test the head-direction system. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have repeatedly shown activations in the hippocampal formation, parietal cortex and retrosplenial regions during tasks involving both egocentric (Wolber et al.  ; Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Galati et al.  ) and allocentric (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Iaria et al.  ) features. While these results suggest that all of these areas are involved in navigation, their specific roles have not yet been identified. In this light, a meta-analytic approach, within the theoretical framework above described, could be useful to identify brain areas that show a consistent response across different studies and experimental settings. Indeed, the differences in cerebral activations we found in the studies cited in the present review of literature could derive from differences in paradigms and tasks used. It is important to note that in the context of fMRI, an experimental task is a way to elicit and to observe a particular cognitive process and that different experimental tasks, coupled with a well-studied control task, can be used to observe the same cognitive process. A great variance in localization and extension of the clusters of cerebral activation found in studies focusing on the same cognitive process (i.e. egocentric or allocentric navigation) or on the same type of spatial representation (i.e. egocentric or allocentric spatial representation), despite the difference in the task used, is certainly surprising and need a deeper analysis. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies, going beyond the limitations of a single study approach, could be a way to fill this gap. \n\n\n## Meta-Analysis \n  \n### Inclusion Criteria for Papers \n  \nThe database search on PubMed was performed using the following string: \u201cfmri AND (navigation OR egocentric OR allocentric OR map) NOT gene NOT genetic NOT DNA NOT heart NOT patients NOT cellular NOT social NOT psychopathy\u201d. A total of 42 studies were found. \n\nOur a-priori inclusion criteria for papers were: 1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); thus, we excluded positron emission tomography (PET) studies, electrophysiology studies and papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. 2) Provision of coordinates of activation foci, either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space. 3) All participants in the studies had to be young and healthy. Studies that included healthy elderly adults were excluded to avoid the effects of aging on navigation. 4) All neuroimaging studies had to include a visuo-perceptual control condition to exclude all activations that were not directly connected to navigation. 5) The experimental tasks required participants to recall a learned environment. They had to make a decision about the pathway learned before or to reach a position in the space by pressing keys or using a joystick. The space was either a virtual reality or a real environment and the task required either allocentric or egocentric strategies. Studies that did not focus on spatial navigation were excluded from the meta-analysis. 6) Only group studies were included. 7) There could be no pharmacological manipulation. \n\nUsing these criteria, we selected 24 studies. Meta-analysis was carried out on 66 neuroimaging experiments (described in the 24 published studies) using the \u201cactivation likelihood estimation\u201d (ALE) analysis. A total of 1023 participants participated in these trials. Studies are summarized in Tables\u00a0  and  .   \nFamiliar and recently learned environment \n  \nExperimental paradigm used in each study \n\nReferences to studies \n\nNumber of subjects included in each study \n\nTotal number of experiments in each paper \n    \nAllocentric and egocentric studies \n  \nNavigational strategies required in reported studies \n\nReferences to studies \n\nNumber of subjects included in each study \n\nTotal number of experiments in each paper \n  \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nActivation likehood estimation (ALE) analyzes the probability that a voxel will contain at least one of the activation foci; it is calculated at each voxel and results in a thresholded ALE map. In other words, ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modelling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\nA general ALE meta-analysis was performed on the foci derived from the selected studies on navigation (Tables\u00a0  and  ). The coordinates of the foci were taken from original papers. A total of 782 foci were reported in 66 experiments including 1023 participants. \n\nWe also performed four separate ALE analyses on four categories of studies in relation to the type of familiarity paradigm (recently learned vs. familiar environment) and spatial strategies (egocentric vs. allocentric strategies) used in the experiment. \n\nRegarding the categorization of studies according to degree of familiarity, we separated experiments according to whether the environment used in the study was unknown to the participants before they were recruited for the study (recently learned environment paradigm, RL) or was already known before they were recruited (familiar environment paradigm, F), for example, their home town (Maguire et al.  ; Nemmi et al.  ), college campus (Epstein and Ward  ) or a specific district (Hirshhorn et al.  ). We categorized 40 experiments as RL environments and 26 as F environments. \n\nRegarding spatial strategies, the allocentric strategy category included studies that required participants to access a cognitive map of the environment or tasks that forced them to rely on a survey representation of the environment (e.g., to find a shortcut in a blocked-route task). In the egocentric strategy category, we included studies in which participants had to access route knowledge of the environment and in which tasks tapped offline egocentric knowledge of an environment, by means of a landmark-based or a route-following strategy (e.g., participants had to judge the relative distance between landmarks and their own position, Rosenbaum et al.  ). As the authors never stated whether the tasks were egocentric (ego) or allocentric (allo), two experimenters (F.N. and M.B.) independently classified the studies. They classified all but one study (in Xu et al.  ) in the same category. The data from this study were included in the general analysis and in the individual ALE analysis of the paradigm (RL vs. F environment) but not in the analysis of the neural substrate of navigational strategies. A total of 30 experiments were defined as allocentric and 34 as egocentric (see Tables\u00a0  and   for more details). \n\nAfter carrying out separate ALE analyses on the categories of studies [  paradigm   (recently learned vs. familiar environment) and   spatial strategies   (egocentric vs. allocentric strategies)], we performed two contrast analyses to directly compare the effects of the paradigms [(F > RL) and (RL > F)] and strategies [(allo > ego) and (ego > allo)]. These contrast analyses allowed highlighting voxels whose signal was greater in the first than the second condition. We also carried out a conjunction analysis of   paradigms   [(RL)^(F)] and   strategies   [(allo)^(ego)] to identify voxels that subtended both paradigm and strategy conditions. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.1.1 (brainmap.org) with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE.). According to Eickhoff et al.\u2019s ( ) modified procedure, the ALE values of each voxel in the brain were computed and a test was performed to determine the null distribution of the ALE statistic of each voxel. The FWHM value was automatically computed, because this parameter is empirically determined (Eickhoff et al.  ). The thresholded ALE map was computed using p values from the previous step and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) at the 0.05 level of significance (Tom Nichol\u2019s FDR algorithm). Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200\u00a0mm  was chosen. A cluster analysis was performed on the thresholded map. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template (brainmap.org) using Mango ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### General Meta-Analysis \n  \nIn the general ALE analysis, we found 25 clusters in both the right and left hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 ) (Detailed information about cluster are reported in supplementary materials, table\u00a0 ). Some of these clusters extended from the right to the left hemisphere and vice versa (e.g. clusters 2, 5 and 11). Others were localized in one of the two hemispheres (clusters 1, 3, 4, 14 and 17). In the right hemisphere, cluster 1 extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cerebellum. In the left hemisphere, cluster 3 extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the anterior cerebellum. An extensive area of ALE peak was found in the left and right precuneus (clusters 4, 5, 17, 25); in the right hemisphere, the precuneus was strongly related to the ALE peaks in the superior and middle occipital gyrus (cluster 4), and in the left hemisphere, to the left superior parietal lobe and the right precuneus (cluster 5). We also found clusters in frontal areas, specifically, the medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus (clusters 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 18). The superior parietal lobe showed ALE peaks together with the inferior parietal lobe (cluster 14) (ALE peaks were found in the superior parietal lobe and the inferior parietal lobe (cluster 14)) in the left hemisphere, and the supramarginal gyrus was active on the right side (cluster 23). Clusters in the occipital cortex extended from the lingual gyrus to the posterior cingulate cortex on the left (cluster 2). We found a cluster that included the middle occipital gyrus and the superior occipital gyrus (cluster 4) in the right hemisphere, but only the middle occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere (clusters 8 and 21). Finally, another cluster in the left hemisphere included the cuneus and the precuneus (cluster 17). We also found a cluster in the right caudate nucleus (cluster 20).   \n a   Results of general ALE meta-analysis: a widespread network of areas seems to subtend the human ability to orient navigation. This network includes the medial temporal lobe, parietal and occipital areas, as well as the cerebellum and frontal lobe.   b   Areas showing activation in both egocentric and allocentric spatial strategies span from the occipital to the frontal lobe, as revealed by conjunction analysis egocentric [AND] allocentric strategies.   c   Areas showing activation for both familiar and recently learned environments, as revealed by conjunction analysis F [AND] RL environments \n  \n\nResults of this general ALE analysis, which showed involvement of the parahippocampal cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Wegman and Janzen  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ; Epstein  ), are in complete agreement with the literature on navigational processes and their neural correlates. We also found consistent and extended clusters in the parietal cortex and frontal areas, which highlights the importance of these structures in navigation. \n\n\n### Paradigm \n  \n#### Familiar Environment \n  \nIn the ALE analysis of the F environment studies, the environment, used as stimulus, was learned through natural exploration (e.g., during daily life activities) and not for experimental purposes. This type of learning also implies that the environmental knowledge used for the experiment was acquired a long time before the study and with no restrictions concerning learning time and modalities (i.e., verbal instructions, free exploration, use of paper maps and\/or combinations of modalities). We found a large cluster extending from the right parahippocampal formation to the right posterior cingulate cortex. Activations of both of these structures were also present in the left hemisphere. An occipital cluster extending from the superior to the middle gyrus was active in the right hemisphere. Other clusters in the right hemisphere included the superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. In the left hemisphere, we found foci in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details). \n\n\n#### Recently Learned Environments \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis of RL environment studies, that is, of studies involving real or virtual environments learned ad hoc for research purposes shown principal clusters in the parahippocampal formation in the right hemisphere, the precuneus bilaterally and the left superior parietal lobule. In the left hemisphere, a cluster was found in the parahippocampal formation and the hippocampus. This is relevant to the animated debate over the role of the hippocampus in navigation. Presumably, the hippocampus is mainly related to acquisition and\/or recall of a recently learned space, created ad hoc for the study, and less to a spatial task requiring access to long-term knowledge of familiar, naturally acquired environments. \n\nWe found a cluster in the superior parietal lobule bilaterally and the inferior parietal lobule of the left hemisphere. Foci were also found in the precuneus bilaterally and the left cuneus. The middle occipital gyrus was bilaterally activated, whereas the superior occipital gyrus was activated only in the left hemisphere and the lingual gyrus only in the right hemisphere. In the left hemisphere, we also found foci in the posterior cingulate cortex. The inferior frontal gyri were bilaterally activated, whereas the superior frontal and middle frontal gyri were activated in the right hemisphere and the medial frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details). \n\n\n#### Contrast Analysis \n  \n##### Familiar vs. Recently Learned Environment \n  \nResults of the T contrast [F > RL] showed clusters of voxels that were more activated by a familiar environment in both left and right hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found a cluster in the middle temporal gyrus on the right and foci in the posterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus on the left.   \n a   Areas showing higher activation for familiar environments than recently learned ones, as revealed in the contrast between F vs. RL environments. This network of areas includes a cluster in the middle temporal gyrus in the right and posterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus of the left hemisphere.   b   Areas showing higher activation of RL than F environments, as revealed by the contrast between RL vs. F environments. This network includes the right parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, insula and inferior parietal lobule, left cuneus, precuneus and lingual gyrus \n  \n\nThese results suggest the existence of a specific network of cerebral areas and specific cognitive processes for well-learned familiar environments (Hirshhorn et al.  ). \n\n\n##### Recently Learned vs. Familiar Environment \n  \nThe opposite T contrast [RL > F] showed clusters of voxels that were more activated by RL (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found clusters bilaterally distributed, including the precuneus and cuneus in the left hemisphere and the precuneus, insula, inferior parietal lobule and parahippocampal gyrus in the right hemisphere. \n\n\n\n#### Conjunction Analysis \n  \nConjunction analysis [RL ^ F] showed that the two types of paradigms partially share a neural network consisting of the fusiform, lingual and middle occipital gyri bilaterally and the calcarine cortex and middle frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Spatial Strategies \n  \n#### Allocentric \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis performed on studies that used tasks which rely on allocentric strategies showed clusters (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details) mainly localized in the parahippocampal gyrus in both right and left hemispheres. Furthermore, bilateral foci were found in the precuneus and lingual gyrus as well as the middle temporal and middle occipital gyri in the right hemisphere and the superior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere. Other bilateral clusters were found in the frontal cortex. \n\n\n#### Egocentric \n  \nIn the right hemisphere, results of the ALE meta-analysis of studies whose tasks relied on egocentric strategies (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details) showed the presence of a cluster involving the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum and posterior cingulate cortex, and a cluster that extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the amygdala. Clusters were also found in the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the precuneus in both hemispheres and the superior and middle occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus of the right hemisphere. In the left hemisphere, we found foci in the middle frontal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cuneus and precuneus, medial frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior parietal lobule and inferior occipital gyrus. Egocentric strategies also seemed related to activation in the right caudate nucleus, a structure shown to be related to egocentric navigational tasks (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ), as well as to a cluster in the superior parietal lobule, which is strongly related to egocentric strategies (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Shelton and Gabrieli  ). \n\nOur finding of involvement of the amygdala as well as the parahippocampal formation in the right hemisphere seems very interesting and somewhat unexpected. \n\nOnce again, results highlighted the role of the parahippocampal formation bilaterally, the lingual gyrus and the parietal lobe (i.e. the precuneus). \n\nResults of contrast analysis showed differences between the two strategies. \n\n\n#### Contrast Analysis \n  \n##### Allocentric vs. Egocentric \n  \nNo suprathreshold clusters were revealed by T contrast [allo > ego], suggesting that the neural areas involved in the two types of navigational strategies partially overlap. This is at odds with results of previous studies that directly compared egocentric and allocentric representations (Galati et al.  ; Committeri et al.  ) but confirms what already partially emerged in studies that directly compared survey and route encoding of spatial information (Shelton and Gabrieli  ). \n\n\n##### Egocentric vs. Allocentric \n  \nAt variance with the previous analysis, T contrast [ego > allo] strategies showed an extended cluster that included the superior occipital gyrus, angular gyrus and precuneus in the right hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nAreas showing higher activation for egocentric than allocentric strategies, as revealed by the contrast between ego vs. allo strategies. A parieto-occipital network that includes the right superior occipital gyrus, angular gyrus and precuneus subtends egocentric representation of space \n  \n\n\n\n#### Conjunction Analysis \n  \nConjunction analysis [allo ^ ego] showed that the two spatial representations share a common network including the fusiform gyrus, insula, lingual gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, and superior frontal lobe bilaterally. Moreover, there was an overlap in the right middle occipital gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis ALE meta-analysis clarified some important issues. First, our finding of converging evidence of a specific and dedicated network for spatial navigation in the human brain (Fig.\u00a0 ) explains some of the discrepancies in neuroimaging studies and corroborates models of human navigation (Byrne and Becker  ; Kravitz et al.  ; Chrastil  ). Second, going beyond the limitations of the single study approach, our results strongly support the hypothesis that there are different neural substrates for navigating in a well-learned, familiar environment and a recently learned environment. Finally, this analysis helps clarify the extent of the overlap between the brain networks of the egocentric and allocentric strategies employed in navigation (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details).   \n a   Diagram shows the proposed network of human spatial navigation, as revealed by contrast analysis of paradigms (F vs. RL and RL vs. F).   Green rectangle   shows the subset of areas of navigation across F environments (  MFG   middle frontal gyrus,   MTG   middle temporal gyrus,   PCC   posterior cingulate cortex).   Blue triangle   shows the subset of areas involved in processing RL environments (  IPL   inferior parietal lobule,   pCU   precuneus,   CU   cuneus,   LG   lingual gyrus, PHG parahippocampal gyrus).   b   Diagram shows the proposed network of human spatial navigation, as revealed by contrast analysis of strategies (ego vs. allo).   Red circle   shows the subset of areas of egocentric representation of space (  SOG   superior occipital gyrus,   AG   angular gyrus,   pCU   precuneus) \n  \n\nThe results of the   general ALE meta-analysis   emphasize the role of the parahippocampal gyrus and retrosplenial cortex in navigation. Previously, both of these areas were often associated with navigational processes (Epstein  ; Vann et al.  ) and were hypothesized to play separate and complementary roles in human navigation (Epstein et al.  ; Iaria et al.  ), particularly in the retrieval and localization of visual scenes (Epstein  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ). Our findings also confirm involvement of the parietal lobes (Sack  ) in human navigation as well as the middle occipital gyri bilaterally (Epstein et al.  ; Rosenbaum et al.  ) and the caudate nucleus. The importance of the frontal areas in human navigation was confirmed by bilateral activations in the middle frontal gyri, as evidenced by the general ALE. As most studies included in the meta-analysis (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ; Ekstrom and Bookheimer  ) required that participants \u201cfind a way\u201d to perform a navigational problem-solving task, we suggest that the frontal areas may have a significant role in planning navigation, especially when detours are required. As few studies have investigated this point, it is still unclear whether navigational planning and problem solving differ from other types of planning and problem solving from cognitive and neural perspectives. We also observed cerebellar activations, which need to be further investigated. \n\n### Paradigms: Recently Learned and Familiar Environments \n  \nThe contrast between studies using paradigms of familiar environments and recently learned environments resulted in significant differences in both directions. A fronto-temporal-parietal network (including the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus) seems to be involved in processing F environments (familiar vs. recently learned environments, Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas activations of the parahippocampal formation, lingual gyrus and fusiform regions are evidenced by RL environment paradigms (recently learned vs. familiar environments, Fig.\u00a0 ). Hirshhorn et al. ( ) observed that degree of familiarity affects the networks involved in navigational tasks. This is also consistent with findings reported in the neuropsychological literature that lesions in the parahippocampal cortex cause anterograde disorientation (i.e., the inability to learn novel routes and create representations of novel environments) but do not affect the ability to orient and navigate in familiar environments, thus sparing spatial knowledge acquired before the lesion (Habib and Sirigu  ; Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). This result is also consistent with the Standard model of memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez  ), which posited a time-limited role of the hippocampus for declarative memories. \n\nHowever, we cannot exclude that the possible role of the hippocampal formation in recalling a recently learned environment is consistent with its proposed role in novelty detection and orienting reactions (Vinogradova  ; Kumaran and Maguire  ,  ,  ). Indeed, according to the multiple trace theory recently acquired environments (at variance with familiar environments) may require further consolidation of memory traces by means of hippocampal activations. Also, as the RL environments are not yet completely consolidated, they may still make use of the hippocampus as a comparator, similar to novel environments when they are being acquired for the first time. \n\nAs to familiar environment paradigms, lesions in the posterior cingulate cortex, which is part of the fronto-temporo-parietal network identified in familiar environment paradigms, result in deficits in orienting and navigating in environments that were familiar before the lesion (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). Areas involved in the network that processes familiar environments are also strongly related to egocentric spatial representations (Galati et al.  ) and the translation of representations from allocentric to egocentric formats and vice versa (Byrne and Becker  ). Thus, lesions in these areas may affect the recall of knowledge about familiar environments and prevent its transformation from an allocentric format stored in long-term memory (Montello  ) to an egocentric format used for driving actual navigation (Byrne and Becker  ). \n\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that recently learned and familiar environments are processed by recruiting partially different networks. The first network includes the parahippocampal, fusiform and lingual gyri and is involved in processing memories relative to recently learned environments. The second network includes the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus and is involved in recalling familiar environments. \n\n\n### Spatial Strategies: Allocentric and Egocentric Representations \n  \nThe ALE analysis of navigational strategies showed that different and only partially overlapping systems are involved in processing allocentric and egocentric strategies. Conjunction analysis between allocentric and egocentric strategies demonstrated that they share a common network of areas (i.e., fusiform gyrus, insula, lingual gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, superior frontal lobe bilaterally, right middle occipital gyrus, left precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus). \n\nInterestingly, the individual ALE on allocentric strategies revealed a cluster in the left superior temporal gyrus. The role of this structure in allocentric strategies is consistent with the hypothesis that it contributes to the formation and use of allocentric representations through the processing of categorical spatial relations (van Asselen et al.  ). In any case, the contrast between allocentric and egocentric studies failed to show any suprathreshold cluster, demonstrating that allocentric encoding recruits a subset of areas also by egocentric encoding, in agreement with Shelton and Gabrieli ( ). \n\nRegarding egocentric strategies, the ALE analysis of egocentric vs. allocentric strategies (Fig.\u00a0 ) showed activation in the right precuneus and angular gyrus. This finding confirms the existence of a dedicated network for the egocentric representation of space in the right hemisphere, including areas in the parietal cortex (probably related to spatial representation) and the retrosplenial cortex (possibly coding heading vectors by means of head direction cells). \n\nInterestingly, patients with right brain damage often have a deficit in spatial navigation and wayfinding (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ) and lesions of the right precuneus and angular gyrus lead to egocentric disorientation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). Several studies also suggest that the retrosplenial cortex is involved in egocentric spatial navigation and that its lesioning may lead to a condition called Heading Disorientation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ; Takahashi et al.  ) or Retrosplenial Amnesia (Rudge and Warrington  ). This network is probably also involved in translating allocentric representations of space into egocentric ones and vice versa (Byrne and Becker  ). \n\nSome caution is required in interpreting the results of comparison between egocentric and allocentric strategies. First of all, in discussing the differences between allocentric and egocentric strategies, it has to be taken into account that fMRI studies of egocentric navigation are intrinsically limited by the nature of the neuroimaging technique. Indeed, ecological egocentric navigation, especially in animal models, is supposed to heavily depend on internally generated cues, such as idiothetic cues (for example, proprioceptive, vestibular, optic flow inputs). In this light, the mandatory absence of actual motion in fMRI, excluding the presence of any idiothetic cue, affects the egocentric-based processing. This pervasive limitation across fMRI studies of egocentric navigation could account at least in part of the similarity between allocentric and egocentric strategies that resulted from our meta-analysis. Secondly, the   a posteriori   assignment of the studies to the egocentric and the allocentric navigational strategies could have weakened the differences in the meta-analysis results due to a mis-classification of studies or the overlapping in the strategies that may be used in performing some tasks. Indeed, the authors did not always explicitly report the kind of strategy their study aimed to analyze. However, in all of the studies the type of strategy the authors had sought for their tasks can be easily detected, even when it is not explicitly described in introduction, by the description of tasks themselves and by the discussion, where authors tried to link their functional findings to specific cognitive processes. Moreover, in most of the studies included in the meta-analysis, authors elicited a specific strategy by adopting paradigmatic tasks specifically developed to tap just a definite strategy rather than explicitly instructing subjects to follow that definite strategy. Thus it is possible that, despite the author\u2019s intention to evaluate the neural bases of a navigational strategy (for example egocentric strategy) by means of a paradigmatic task (for example, a route-following task), actually some subjects perform the task by relying on the other strategy (for example, by relying on an allocentric strategy). It should, however, be consider that this is a common problem in cognitive neuroscience, since we can never be completely sure that subjects perform any experimental task by relying on the strategy authors meant to test. In any case, even being cautious, we retain that present results offer import suggestions for understanding the complex human navigational system and also suggest directions for future studies, which should pay attention in the more clearly defining the strategy analyzed and also in contrasting different strategies in the same study. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions \n  \nOur meta-analysis confirms current models of human navigation, which propose that navigational memory and navigation itself are achieved by means of multi-process systems involving a widespread set of neural areas (Fig.\u00a0 ) (Byrne and Becker  ; Montello  ; Siegel and White  ; Brunsdon et al.  ; Chrastil  ). This meta-analysis allowed us to identify clusters of areas that form specific functional networks, which are selectively involved in different processes. The first differentiation concerns degree of familiarity with the environment. Our data suggest the following: the parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform and lingual gyri are part of a neural system that codes and stores environmental information; the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus are responsible for the recall of stored environmental information; the posterior cingulate cortex is more involved in transforming information from the allocentric format, in which it is stored in long-term memory (Byrne and Becker  ), into the egocentric format necessary for driving actual navigation; and the frontal areas are more involved in planning routes in the recalled environments. Partially different networks are also involved in processing allocentric and egocentric representations, which are the core of different navigational strategies. Our results show that, although allocentric representation recruited a subset of areas also involved in egocentric representations, the latter are achieved by means of a specific network including includes the right precuneus and the angular gyrus. Allocentric representations rely on activations of the left superior temporal gyrus, a structure that is also involved in categorical spatial relations and perhaps also in so-called \u201cspatial language\u201d. \n\nFinally, we wish to briefly discuss the involvement of two sets of cerebral areas, revealed by the present ALE, whose roles have been little investigated in human navigation. First, the results revealed a set of frontal areas, which could have a significant role in planning navigation. At the moment, however, it is unclear whether navigational planning is processed by the same systems involved in other types of planning or by specific subsets of frontal areas. Second, the analysis suggests that the cerebellum may have an important role in spatial navigation. But, due to the lack of studies on this issue the specific role of the cerebellum is still unclear. Experimental studies in rodents showed specific reduction of efficiency during navigational tasks performed by cerebellar-damaged rats (Foti et al.  ; review in Petrosini et al.  ) as did neuropsychological studies with patients (Molinari et al.  ; Schmahmann  ). In any case, to our knowledge the role of the cerebellum in human navigation has never been analyzed in detail. Thus, future studies specifically aimed at assessing the role of this region are necessary in order to understand the cerebellar contribution to navigational processes. \n\nBoth of these findings suggest the need for further studies aimed at investigating the role of areas other than those currently considered to be involved in human navigation. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":4010721,"text_md5":"b417d750a2275e5b26d1ff2255441471","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,77],"publication_year":[79,83],"title":[94,213],"keywords":[227,304],"abstract":[317,2187],"body":[2196,56877]},"batch":2,"pmid":24488500,"doi":"10.1007\/s11065-014-9247-8","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4010721","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4010721"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4010721\">4010721<\/a>","list_title":"PMC4010721  Neuropsychology of Environmental Navigation in Humans: Review and Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies in Healthy Participants"}

The specific neural correlates of this construct are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 42 fMRI studies on visual vWM in healthy subjects (  n   = 795, males = 459, females = 325, unknown = 11; age range: 18\u201375). The studies were obtained after an exhaustive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brainmap database. We analyzed regional activation differences during fMRI tasks with the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping software (ES-SDM). The results were further validated by performing jackknife sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses. We investigated the effect of numerous relevant influencing factors by fitting corresponding linear regression models. We isolated consistent activation in a network containing fronto-parietal areas, right cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Regarding lateralization, the results pointed toward a bilateral frontal activation, a left-lateralization of parietal regions and a right-lateralization of the cerebellum, indicating that the left-hemisphere concept of vWM should be reconsidered. We also isolated activation in regions important for response inhibition, emphasizing the role of attentional control in vWM. Moreover, we found a significant influence of mean reaction time, load, and age on activation associated with vWM. Activation in left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and left precentral gyrus turned out to be positively associated with mean reaction time whereas load was associated with activation across the PFC, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex, and parts of the cerebellum. In the latter case activation was mainly detectable in both hemispheres whereas the influence of age became manifest predominantly in the left hemisphere. This led us to conclude that future vWM studies should take these factors into consideration. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWorking memory (WM) is a cognitive system that holds information available that is needed for complex cognition in the present moment (Baddeley,  ; Oberauer and Hein,  ). It has been shown that WM capacity is a strong predictor of a wide range of complex cognitive tasks such as analytic problem solving, language acquisition, and reading comprehension (Daneman and Carpenter,  ; Engle et al.,  ; Wiley and Jarosz,  ). There have been several attempts to understand the organization of human WM. The arguably most influential model is the multiple-component model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch ( ). The authors hypothesized the existence of a \u201ccentral executive\u201d component, which controls the incoming information and passes the information to two subsystems: the \u201cphonological loop\u201d and the \u201cvisuospatial sketchpad.\u201d Within the phonological loop, due to the interplay of its two components\u2014the phonological store and the articulatory loop\u2014the verbal material representation can be kept in an active state. Verbal information is processed in perceptual systems before it enters the phonological loop in which it is temporarily stored in the phonological store and maintained through the articulatory loop using subvocal rehearsal of the information. In addition to subvocal rehearsal, the articulatory loop is also thought to be involved whenever verbal information is presented visually: whereas auditory verbal information (e.g., spoken words) can directly enter the phonological store, visually presented verbal information (e.g., written words) must first be recoded into phonological information. In other words, subvocalization is necessary in order to reroute visually derived verbal material into the phonological store (Buchsbaum and D'Esposito,  ). The visuospatial sketchpad is responsible for integrating visual and spatial information. Later, the \u201cepisodic buffer\u201d was added (Baddeley,  ). It binds the information from the different subsystems into integrated episodes. Alternative models proposed that WM holds any type of information in a state of heightened availability (Oberauer,  ; Cowan et al.,  ) whereas others models have emphasized on the role of attentional control in WM (e.g., Kane and Engle,  ; Unsworth and Engle,  ). These different theoretical conceptualizations of WM are not necessarily mutually exclusive (Cowan et al.,  ), with common features including a variety of processes such as encoding, maintaining and retrieving information of various domains (e.g., letters, geometric forms, or words), and some attentional control mechanism that supports dealing with interference from irrelevant or distracting information. Thus, the neural correlates of WM may vary depending on the processes, the type of information, and the modality of stimulation (auditory or visual). Given the variety across studies with regard to WM domain and the lack of process differentiation in most studies, the present meta-analysis focused exclusively on visually presented verbal working memory (vWM) across all processes involved in WM. \n\n### Visual Verbal Working Memory \n  \nSeveral fMRI studies over the past years have specifically investigated the brain areas involved in vWM (Honey et al.,  ; Veltman et al.,  ; Chen and Desmond,  ; Narayanan et al.,  ; Wolf et al.,  ). They basically corroborated the general notion that a variety of brain networks are activated during vWM mainly including areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the parietal cortex as well as cerebellar and basal ganglia regions (Paulesu et al.,  ; Petrides et al.,  ; Desmond et al.,  ; Crosson et al.,  ; Lewis et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ; Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Th\u00fcrling et al.,  ; Moore et al.,  ; Chai et al.,  ). Previous meta-analyses have indicated that the left PFC might be predominantly involved in vWM processes whereas the right PFC seems to be more strongly involved in spatial WM, leading to a lateralization of this region due to different input (Wager and Smith,  ; Owen et al.,  ). However, there is no general consensus on the functional organization of the PFC (Eriksson et al.,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies suggested that the articulatory loop is associated with the left inferior frontal cortex\u2014where Broca's area is located \u2013, left supplementary motor area (SMA), left premotor cortex (BA6), and left insula. The phonological store has been shown to be associated with the left BA 40, corresponding to the left supramarginal gyrus located in the left inferior parietal lobule. Thus, these regions are essential for any kind of vWM task (Paulesu et al.,  ; Smith and Jonides,  ; Henson et al.,  ; Buchsbaum and D'Esposito,  ). Moreover, parietal activation has been interpreted as a buffer for modality-specific information. Whereas, the relevance of prefrontal and parietal regions for vWM has long been recognized, the cerebellum came into focus only some years ago. Originally regarded mainly as a structure involved in motor control and coordination, its involvement in higher-order cognitive processes, such as vWM, is no longer called into question (Ravizza et al.,  ; Hayter et al.,  ; Cooper et al.,  ; Th\u00fcrling et al.,  ; Tomlinson et al.,  ). More specifically, it has been suggested that the cerebellum plays a relevant role in subvocal rehearsal, but the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the various processes involved in vWM is still a matter of debate (Desmond et al.,  ; Pleger and Timmann,  ). Like the cerebellum, the basal ganglia (BG) are critical structures for motor control by enhancing desired motor behaviors and suppressing undesired ones (Alexander et al.,  ; Mink,  ). In addition, the BG are involved in various cognitive processes, such as language production and working memory (McNab et al.,  ). Again, for many years, fMRI studies on vWM tended to focus on cortical structures such as parietal and frontal regions, underestimating the relevance of BG structures such as caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. Finally, limbic areas, such as cingulate, are known to be involved in vWM, but its contribution has likewise long been underestimated (Moore et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Influencing Factors in the Neural Correlates of vWM \n  \nActivation in these brain regions can be influenced by several factors, such as age, gender, and type and difficulty (i.e., WM load) of the fMRI task. Moreover, the activation can be assumed to depend on individual performance (e.g., response velocity\/speed as assessed by mean response times) and the statistical threshold which analyses are based on. \n\n\n### Age \n  \nOlder adults compared to younger adults have been found to show a more bilateral pattern of prefrontal cortex activity under comparable task demands, a finding which constituted the basis of the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model (Cabeza,  ; Cabeza et al.,  ). One hypothesis is that bilateral activity in older adults could reflect a functional compensatory mechanism, in which age-related asymmetry reductions compensate neurocognitive decline leading to a less lateralized brain activity. This is known as the compensation view. A second hypothesis is the so-called dedifferentiation view which assumes a less specific recruitment of neural networks due to gradual changes occurring with age. In a PET study, Reuter-Lorenz et al. ( ) showed that PFC activity in younger adults was left lateralized for verbal and right lateralized for spatial stimuli, whereas older adults presented a bilateral PFC activation for verbal and visual tasks. This model is not only supported by functional neuroimaging results but also by behavioral results from a letter matching task (Reuter-lorenz et al.,  ). Apart from these models, a number of other theories related to age differences in brain activation have been proposed, such as the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA). This theory assumes both frontal over-activation and posterior midline cortex under-activation in older adults compared to younger ones (Davis et al.,  ). The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) proposes that people will activate more cortical regions if task difficulty increases (Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ). Finally, the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC and STAC-r) suggests that the increased frontal activation with age is a marker of the adaptive human brain indicating a compensation for the structural and functional decline going along with aging (Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). This theory takes a holistic view by considering compensation a normal process involved in our daily lives in order to be able to achieve our goals. \n\n\n### Gender \n  \nThe influence of gender in the context of WM and, more specifically, vWM, is still rather controversial, with some studies reporting no gender effects (Bell et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ) and others reporting significant differences between male and female participants (Lejbak et al.,  ; Zilles et al.,  ). The controversial results might be due to the potential influence of sex hormones, which have been shown to influence several cognitive functions including vWM (Mordecai et al.,  ; Joseph et al.,  ). Sex hormones are known to fluctuate with, for instance, menstrual cycle or hormonal contraception. However, most studies did not provide any information on these aspects which may explain the result heterogeneity to some degree. \n\n\n### Additional Factors (Tasks, Load, Mean, Reaction Time) \n  \nA previous meta-analysis showed differences in brain activity due to WM task type (Rottschy et al.,  ). They found that n-back and Sternberg tasks, which are typical fMRI WM tasks, not only showed differences in mental processes but also in brain activation. Moreover, tasks can vary in their difficulty through modulating the WM load (i.e., the number of items that need to be remembered). Load effects reflect the neural activation related to the increasing memory demands of information (Cowan et al.,  ; Cowan,  ). Rottschy et al. ( ) found that load effects were mainly associated with activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, Honey et al. ( ) demonstrated that prolonged mean reaction times (RT) in response to a vWM task could influence activation in WM related brain regions. Therefore, these findings suggest that all the previously mentioned potential factors should be taken into consideration. \n\n\n### Aim of the Study \n  \nAgainst this background, the first aim of the present study was to provide an updated and extended meta-analysis of the neural correlates of vWM in healthy humans using a coordinate-based meta-analysis. The second aim was to find out more about the role of the potential moderators (age, gender, type and difficulty of the fMRI task, mean RT, and statistical threshold). Although task performance which is related to the difficulty level could be another potential factor, it was not taken into consideration due to the heterogeneous assessment in the selected studies (i.e., absolute correct values, percentage of correct values, accuracy) as pointed also by Meule ( ). To our knowledge this is the first meta-analysis to study these factors in vWM. A better knowledge about their influence on the neural correlates of vWM will increase understanding of the general mechanisms of vWM as well as help to improve methods and analyses of future vWM studies. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and Inclusion of Studies \n  \nAn exhaustive literature search was conducted on whole-brain fMRI studies on vWM from January 2000 to December 2017. We searched the databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for English-language studies with the combination of the following key words: \u201cn-back,\u201d \u201cDMTS,\u201d \u201cSternberg,\u201d \u201ddelayed matched to sample,\u201d \u201cdelayed match to sample,\u201d plus \u201cverbal working memory,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201chealthy.\u201d The Brainmap database was also searched with their respective search criteria (Subjects Size is more than 10, Experiments Paradigm Class is Delayed Match to Sample\/n-back, Experiments Imaging Modality is fMRI, Conditions Stimulus is Visual Letters, and Subjects Handedness is Right). Further studies (11 publications) were identified through chasing citations from the selected studies (see   for flowchart diagram). The \u201cMeta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\u201d (MOOSE) guidelines Stroup et al. ( ) were used for the literature search and selection of studies. All articles were identified, selected and coded by a single investigator (M.E.). The same investigator double-checked the manually extracted peak coordinates and effect size values from the selected studies. \n  \nFlowchart diagram of selected papers. \n  \nThe criteria for inclusion were whole-brain analyses with reported results in a standard reference space (Talairach or MNI), inclusion of more than 10 healthy subjects and studies with clear boundaries between inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were excluded if they only included region-of-interests (ROI) analyses, did not report peak coordinates, investigated between- or within-group effects of pharmacological treatment, disease, living conditions, or used reward trials or emotional retrieval. We also excluded studies that re-analyzed previously reported data to avoid overestimating the effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) experiments were also not included in this meta-analysis due to methodological differences (e.g., differences in temporal resolution between PET and MRI) and differences in the underlying physiology (i.e., BOLD contrast vs. glucose mechanism). \n\n\n### Comprehensive Meta-Analysis \n  \nWe first conducted a meta-analysis of all the vWM studies. The demographic and study characteristics are shown in  . The vast majority of the selected studies used the SPM software ( ) to perform their fMRI analyses (83.3% of studies) indicating a clear bias toward this software package. Coordinates and   t  -values included in the analysis are shown in  . When only   p  - or   z  -values were reported, they were transformed into   t  -values taking into account the sample size per study. The influence of gender (% female), mean age, type of fMRI task (DMTS including the Sternberg task or n-back), mean RT, and the type of threshold used in the study (uncorrected vs. corrected) were studied with meta-regressions. The majority of studies corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR), except for one study that used the family-wise error rate (FWE) and another one that used Bonferroni correction. Those studies presenting results with peak coordinates at   p   < 0.005 or   p   < 0.001 uncorrected (33.3%) controlled for the cluster-size with different thresholds (5, 8, 10, 17, or 25 contiguous voxels). On a side note\u2014although IQ and years of education have been shown to be associated with WM performance (Fukuda et al.,  ; Boller et al.,  ), we could not assess these factors here because the majority of studies did not provide any information on IQ or years of education. \n  \nCharacteristics of the 42 fMRI studies included in the meta-analysis. \n  \nn, sample size; SD, standard deviation; NA, not announced; % Fem, percentage of female participants; L, level; E, encoding; M, maintenance; R, recall; RT, reaction time. \n  \nThere are several established fMRI vWM paradigms: n-back, Sternberg, and delayed matching to sample (DMTS) tasks (Kirchner,  ; Sternberg,  ; Paule et al.,  ). N-back tasks include a sequential presentation of stimuli. Subjects have to decide whether the current stimulus is the same as the one   n   positions before (e.g., the previous one in a 1-back condition or the one two positions back in a 2-back condition). In Sternberg tasks, a set of stimuli is presented simultaneously that need to be maintained over a certain period which is followed by a single probe stimulus for which participants need to decide whether it was part of the set or not. In DMTS tasks, a single stimulus is presented. After the maintenance period, a set of multiple probes is presented from which participants need to recognize the single stimulus they had to memorize. While n-back tasks are normally presented in the form of a block-design, DMTS and Sternberg tasks are presented in an event-related design. \n\n\n### Load-Effect Meta-Analysis \n  \nTo assess the neural correlates of increasing vWM load (i.e., the difficulty of the fMRI task), we performed a load-effect meta-analysis. We only included studies in which there was a contrast between higher and lower vWM loads, such as 3-back vs. 1-back or 3-back vs. 2-back. The selected studies are shown in  . \n\n\n### Meta-Analytical Approach: ES-SDM \n  \nWe used the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d' mapping software ( ) to conduct coordinate-based meta-analyses. The software uses a voxel-based meta-analytic approach. First, a strict selection of the reported peak coordinates of gray matter differences was applied by only including the studies containing whole-brain analyses. This is essential in order to avoid biased results from some neuroimaging studies, in which more liberal statistical thresholds were used for some ROIs relative to the rest of the brain. Peak coordinates in MNI or Talairach and effect size values were manually extracted from each contrast of interest in each study. All p- or z-values were transformed into   t  -values using SDM web utilities. Second, a map for the activation in gray matter was created for each study using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas partitioned into 116 brain regions (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ). If a study included more than one contrast of interest, we adjusted for multiple contrasts by combining the created images of each contrast into one image for the final analyses. The ES-SDM software re-creates the maps from the studies by converting the   t  -value of each peak to Hedge's g (Alegria et al.,  ). Third, an anisotropic non-normalized Gaussian kernel was applied by assigning different values to the different neighboring voxels based on the spatial correlation between them (Radua et al.,  ). At the end, we obtained a mean map by a voxelwise calculation of the mean of the study maps, weighted by the square root of the sample size, so that studies with larger sample sizes contributed more strongly (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nTo assess the robustness of the main findings, we performed a whole-brain Jackknife analysis. Jackknife analysis consists of repeating the statistical analyses several times by discarding one study each time thus demonstrating the stability of the results (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). Heterogeneity of effect sizes and publication bias were assessed with the   I   index and Egger's test (Egger et al.,  ; M\u00fcller et al.,  ). The   I   index provides the proportion of variability across studies that is due to true heterogeneity relative to that from sampling error (Higgins and Thompson,  ). Egger's tests were used to test for asymmetry of funnel plots, serving as an indicator of publication bias (see   for examples). \n\nStatistical significance was determined with random-effects models. We used the default threshold for the calculated mean (voxel-level   p   < 0.005 uncorrected, peak height threshold 1, minimum cluster extent 10 contiguous voxels) (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). To control for multiple testing in the several meta-regressions we used a more conservative threshold, Bonferroni-corrected threshold of   p   < 0.001. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (42 Studies) \n  \nThe mean map of brain regions of the whole-brain meta-analysis for vWM is shown in  . The majority of studies reported only task-positive activation. We observed extended activation patterns in the frontal lobe including left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), medial frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), triangular, orbital and opercular part of the right IFG, orbital and opercular part of the left IFG, bilateral SMA, bilateral precentral gyrus, and left rolandic operculum. There was also activation in parietal areas including left post-central gyrus, right angular gyrus, and left inferior parietal gyri (IPG). Moreover, there was activation in the bilateral median cingulate, the left insula, the right lenticular nucleus (i.e., putamen and pallidum) and in bilateral cerebellum (crus I). \n  \nNeural correlates of vWM estimated by meta-analysis. Results are displayed at   p   < 0.005 (cluster size \u226510) projected on the MNI 151 T1 template. \n  \nRobustness analyses showed that these results were preserved in all studies. Egger's tests indicated that there were some regions for which there was evidence of heterogeneity: left SFG, left SMA, left precentral gyrus, left post-central gyrus, right angular gyrus, left IPG, right median cingulate, left insula, and right cerebellum (crus I) (see  ). \n  \nComprehensive meta-analysis results. \n  \n Only one local peak per gray matter regions is displayed. Robustness analyses displayed for clusters>100 voxels (as in Fullana et al.,  ). MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping; I , percentage of variance attributable to study heterogeneity; JK, jackknife sensitivity test; L., left; R., right  . \n  \nMeta-regression analyses confirmed that mean age and mean RT moderated activation in some brain regions. Mean age was associated with decreased activation in the left rolandic operculum, left insula, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), left IFG (opercular part), left heschl gyrus, left post-central gyrus, left lenticular nucleus (putamen), and the right MFG. Mean RT was positively associated with activation in the left precentral gyrus and the left MFG (see   and  ). None of the other meta-regression analyses yielded any significant results. \n  \nMeta-regression results. Results are displayed at   p   < 0.001 on MNI 152 2009.

Moreover, there was activation in several parietal areas (left post-central gyrus, left angular gyrus, left SPG, and bilateral IPG) as well as in the left anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral median cingulate gyri, left fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum (crus I and hemispheric lobule VI) (see  ). \n  \nLoad-effect meta-analysis results. \n  \n Only one local peak per gray matter regions is displayed. Robustness analyses displayed for clusters>100 voxels (as in Fullana et al.,  ). MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping; I , percentage of variance attributable to study heterogeneity; JK, jackknife sensitivity test; R., right; L., left  . \n  \nJackknife analyses showed that the findings were preserved across studies, except for the right rolandic operculum and left fusiform gyrus, which were no longer detectable after discarding two papers. We only observed heterogeneity in the right inferior parietal gyrus (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present comprehensive meta-analysis across 42 whole-brain vWM fMRI tasks showed vWM processing to be based on a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network and to involve also subcortical regions such as the cingulate, left insula and right lenticular nucleus. Thus, the present results corroborate previously discussed networks, but also provide evidence for the involvement of additional regions that have been neglected in the past in the discussion of vWM processing. \n\n### Dual-Selection Model \n  \nA tentative explanation of the results is provided by the dual-selection model. Nee et al. ( ) proposed this model based on a meta-analysis of 36 event-related fMRI studies aimed at understanding the executive processes of WM. According to this model the caudal superior frontal sulcus (SFS) is associated with a spatial selection while the mid-lateral PFC is especially sensitive to non-spatial content, matching the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d based selections, respectively. This proposal was further corroborated by a previous meta-analysis of 24 experiments based on an n-back task (Owen et al.,  ). The results of the present meta-analysis lend further support to the dual-selection model given that we also found activation of the mid-lateral PFC (bilateral IFG, right MFG, and medial part of the left SFG). The left SFG appeared to be a heterogeneous region. The fact that we found a noticeable bilateral prefrontal activation in this meta-analysis suggests that the assumption of a strongly left-lateralized verbal WM activation in PFC should be reconsidered. However, it needs to be clarified that we did not include studies systematically comparing spatial vs. non-spatial WM. Therefore, these conclusions need to be drawn with caution because the mere fact that we found the same activation does not fully support the dual-selection model. \n\n\n### Phonological Loop \n  \nWe did not find activation of the left supramarginal gyrus, which is known to be important for the phonological store, but instead in the region where the supramarginal gyrus is located, the left inferior parietal cortex. The activation of this region was found to be heterogeneous, which tends to be in line with the hypothesis of Buchsbaum and D'Esposito ( ). They argue that the phonological store does not precisely correspond to a single specific functional brain region, but rather is associated with several brain regions that underlie neural processes from perception and production of speech. Surprisingly, the present meta-analysis did not reveal any activation in the Wernicke area although this is an essential area for the comprehension and\/or production of verbal material (Binder,  ). This area is assumed to comprise mainly the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus as well as the occipito-parieto-temporal junction including the angular gyrus. However, the exact location of the Wernicke area is still a matter of debate also due to its comprehensive and partly heterogeneous functionality in the context of verbal processing. Moreover, the fact that we used the AAL atlas, which comprises relatively large brain regions, might also explain why we were not able to isolate activation of this specific and somewhat ill-defined region. The fact that we did not find any activation in the right parietal cortex was also expected, since this region is assumed to serve spatial rehearsal. Hence, as opposed to the bilateral activation in the prefrontal cortex, activation in the parietal cortex turned out to be strongly left-lateralized, presumably due to modality. As predicted, we also found activation in the left IFG containing the Broca's area, as well as in the left SMA, which are components central to the articulatory loop. The fact that we did not find any activation in the premotor cortex could also be due to the atlas used. The AAL atlas does not contain this region because the labeled SMA embeds both the premotor cortex and the pre-SMA. Therefore, we cannot exclude that there was specific activation of the premotor cortex. In addition, there was activation in the left rolandic operculum, which is caudally adjacent to Broca's area. It has been demonstrated that this brain area is involved in speech production (Koelsch et al.,  ) and speech prosody processing (Wu et al.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first WM meta-analysis isolating activation specifically in this area. This finding may indicate that the majority of the participants used an overt rehearsal strategy during the vWM tasks. Further studies testing the impact of the opportunity for rehearsal during vWM tasks on brain activation are however needed to confirm this hypothesis. \n\n\n### Attentional Control \n  \nMany conceptualizations of WM include an attentional control mechanism that supports dealing with interferences such as from other items in memory. The right IFG has been proposed to be an important region for attentional control (Aron et al.,  ; Forstmann et al.,  ). Specifically, Aron et al. 's ( ) data strongly suggest that response inhibition is uniquely located in the right IFG, in particular in its triangular part. The data were acquired by studying patients with lesions of the right frontal lobe during a go\/no-go task. Forstmann et al. ( ) found a direct linkage between structural and functional properties of the right IFG, and its role in response inhibition. Another fMRI study (Aron and Poldrack,  ) found that the IFG targets the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and regions in its vicinity. The STN sends excitatory projections to the globus pallidus externus, which, in turn, suppresses the thalamo-cortical output; this is assumed to lead to an inhibition of the initiated response. Finally, a strongly right-lateralized network comprising the right IFG, the STN, and also the pre-SMA, is recruited during response suppression (Aron,  ). It remains unclear, however, whether the right IFG triggers the STN directly or via the pre-SMA (Aron et al.,  ). We found a strong activation of the right IFG, especially in the triangular part, the right SMA\u2014which also includes the pre-SMA in this atlas \u2013, and the right pallidum, giving support to the idea that these areas constitute a network subserving response inhibition in the context of vWM processing. Indeed, a substantial body of behavioral research has found that attentional control as employed in response inhibition tasks is related to WM capacity (Kane and Engle,  ; Unsworth and Engle,  , but see Rey-Mermet et al.,  ). Notably, heterogeneity analyses confirmed the stability of these networks indicating that activation in these regions is not likely due to a possible publication bias. However, it is important to mention that the selected studies did not manipulate attention. The fact that we found activation in the same areas that mediate response inhibition in other experimental contexts does not completely mean that they do so in the context of vWM. \n\nIn addition to the IFG, the angular gyrus has been found to be activated in the context of response inhibition (Wager et al.,  ). The angular gyrus is located in the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and has been found to be activated in a variety of tasks (Seghier,  ). Some anatomical studies (Makris et al.,  ,  ; Uddin et al.,  ) define the angular gyrus as an important seed point, given its strong interaction with temporo-frontal subsystems as well as regions such as hippocampus, caudate, and precuneus. It is a key component of the default-mode network and shows activation in most tasks demanding information retrieval (Spaniol et al.,  ; Kim,  ). The role of this region in memory retrieval is plausible given its strong connectivity with the hippocampus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the right angular gyrus appears in a vWM meta-analysis. Considering that this region has been reported to be important for inhibition and retrieval we conclude that the activation of the angular gyrus in the present meta-analysis may predominantly reflect the employment of attentional control during information retrieval. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of this region's activity being found due to presence of publication bias in the selected literature. Further studies allowing for a separate analysis of the retrieval process are however needed to further explore this assumption. \n\n\n### Cerebellar and Subcortical Activations \n  \nIt has been shown that cerebellum is connected not only to motor areas, but also to prefrontal cortical areas (Schmahmann,  ); this suggests an involvement of the cerebellum in higher-order cognitive processes. A distinct cross-cerebro-cerebellar circuitry for vWM has been proposed with predominant involvement of right cerebellum, especially the lobule VI (Ng et al.,  ). In accordance with this proposal, earlier studies already pointed at the relevance of the right cerebellum in the context of vWM. Using inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) Tomlinson et al. ( ) found that participants were less accurate during a verbal version of the Sternberg task if a trial was preceded by a stimulation of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Moreover, patients with right-sided cerebellar lesions have been found to be impaired in verbal memory, whereas patients with left cerebellar lesions turned out to be slower in a visuospatial task (Hokkanen et al.,  ). All these findings suggest a lateralized function of the cerebellum with its right hemisphere contributing mainly to verbal and its left hemisphere to visuospatial processing. Moreover, a meta-analysis (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) analyzing cerebellum neuroimaging studies found that regions involved in vWM studies overlap with those involved in language tasks which is in agreement with domain-specific storage modules as in Baddeley's model. It corroborates the idea that vWM is more right-lateralized with a strong activation occurring mostly at the junction lobule VI\/Crus I. Our results showing a significantly stronger activation in the right cerebellum (crus I) support this hypothesis. A case study of a right cerebellar hemispherectomy in an 18-years-old patient reported that the patient suffered from a disproportionate impairment of the rehearsal system, while the phonological store was preserved (Silveri et al.,  ). This could be due to anatomical connections between Broca's area, left SMA, right lobule VI and crus I of the cerebellum (Schmahmann,  ). However, in the present meta-analysis, we did not differentiate between those processes and, thus, we cannot further investigate whether the right cerebellum is mainly involved in rehearsal. Still, our analysis provides clear evidence for the relevance of the right cerebellum, especially crus I, in the context of vWM processing. Further studies disentangling the different vWM processes are warranted to elucidate the specific function of the right cerebellum in vWM. \n\nApart from the cerebellum, a number of additional subcortical areas are assumed to be relevant for vWM. Thus, basal ganglia regions, especially the caudate and the lenticular nucleus, have been found to be activated during encoding and maintenance phases during vWM tasks (Lewis et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ; Moore et al.,  ). Although in the present meta-analysis basal ganglia activation was restricted to the right lenticular nucleus, it remains unclear whether the activation is ascribable to these processes. Again, we were unable to distinguish between the different vWM processes given the available data. Caudate, putamen and capsular regions are known to receive afferents from the left pre-SMA region, which is involved in vWM (Inase et al.,  ). Crosson et al. ( ) found that basal ganglia activity was accompanied by activation of the left pre-SMA during a word production task. They hypothesized that the increase of right basal ganglia activation serves to suppress the non-dominant right frontal cortex, whereas the increase of the left basal ganglia activation serves to enhance the language processing of the left dominant hemisphere. Against the background of these findings, the basal ganglia can be assumed to interact closely with the frontal cortex and to serve as a selective gating mechanism for the prefrontal cortex (Frank et al.,  ). From this perspective, the findings showing the basal ganglia to be active only during encoding and maintenance phases seem plausible, because selective gating plays a major role for these processes. However, as we did not study the phases separately, we cannot rule out that these activations also reflect attentional processes in addition to pure vWM processes. Moreover, six publications compared activation conditions with a simple baseline (e.g., fixation of a cross hair). Hence, we cannot rule out that some parts of the subcortical activation were due to motor activity (i.e., button press in the activation conditions vs. no button press in the baseline condition). In the present meta-analysis we also found left pre-SMA activation, but a conclusion about their influence on basal ganglia is unwarranted without any connectivity data. In addition to the pre-SMA activation, our meta-analysis demonstrated significant activation in the anterior cingulate which has been found to be activated during vWM tasks before (Bedwell et al.,  ; Narayanan et al.,  ). It should be noted that in the AAL atlas the significant cluster was labeled as median cingulate, which is part of the anterior cingulate. It is striking, however, that a majority of vWM did not find an involvement of the anterior cingulate. Hence, future studies should make an attempt to clarify the specific contribution of the different parts of the cingulate to vWM. \n\n\n### Age, Load, and Mean RT as Influencing Factors \n  \nAge-related changes in vWM are not fully understood because of a lack of longitudinal data. A recent longitudinal study found the activation of left prefrontal cortex (i.e., MFG and parts of the IFG) to be reduced during a vWM manipulation task in older people (Rieckmann et al.,  ). Somewhat in accordance with this finding, the present meta-analysis demonstrated a negative association between activation in the left and right IFG\u2014including Broca's area\u2014and age. In addition, we found a negative association between activation in the right MFG and age. It is known that cortical thickness, surface area, and volume of this region decrease with age (Lemaitre et al.,  ) which may, to some degree, explain this finding. Moreover, the right MFG plays a central role in reorienting attention from exogenous to endogenous attentional control (Japee et al.,  ). Our results are in agreement with the ontogenetic model of brain development according to which those brain regions that are the last to mature are the first to be affected by aging (Raz et al.,  ). Of note, all the other regions exhibiting a negative association between activation and age were localized in the left hemisphere. We found this negative association in the left insula, which\u2014as stated above\u2014plays a relevant role in the context of rehearsal, in the left putamen, which is involved in the active filtering of irrelevant material allowing us to focus on relevant material (Moore et al.,  ) in the left rolandic operculum, important for overt rehearsal, and in the left superior temporal gyrus, parts of which are critically involved in phonological storage. The fact that these regions important for different vWM processes showed a negative association with age might explain why older people tend to exhibit worse vWM performance, although it should be kept in mind that we did not take into account any longitudinal data or individual subject performance. Since these associations were detectable mainly in the left hemisphere and age-related changes were not restricted to the right PFC, our results seem to speak against the HAROLD model (Cabeza et al.,  ). Overall, the present results do not provide any evidence for a decrease of this lateralization with age, as claimed in other studies (Reuter-Lorenz et al.,  ; Cabeza et al.,  ,  ). The fact that we found a decreased frontal activation with increasing age could either mean that the brain is not as adaptive as proposed by the earlier discussed STAC model or indicate that task demands were too high for elderly people leading to a \u201cbreakdown\u201d of frontal activation instead of a compensatory increase. In order to draw any further conclusion it would be helpful to study the activation of these regions in elderly people taking also into account their individual task performance (e.g., accuracy). However, only three studies selected for the meta-analysis specifically included older populations; thus, the age-range was clearly undersampled in the current meta-analysis and the power to reliably assess the influence of age was too low. This might also explain why our results do not seem to be in line with the HAROLD model. Therefore, more empirical data comparing older and younger populations are necessary in order to find out more about specific age differences in activation during vWM. A better understanding of these age-related differences would pave the way for creating more sophisticated methods to preserve or enhance cognitive function in elderly populations. \n\nH\u00f6ller-Wallscheid et al. ( ) hypothesized the decreased lateralization across the PFC to be independent of age, but to depend on the subjective difficulty of WM tasks. In line with this hypothesis we found a bilateral activation across the PFC in the load effect meta-analysis. Our results are also in accordance with the load effect meta-analysis performed by Rottschy et al. ( ). The CRUNCH model states that the extent of cortical activation depends on the task load. Our results support this model, since we found a positive correlation between activation in several cortical regions (e.g., frontal areas) and task load. Apart from PFC areas we also found activation in the parietal cortex (IPG and left SPG) to be influenced by load, as reported in a previous study by Braver et al. ( ). Likewise, activation of the right lobule VI and crus I of the cerebellum turned out to depend on the difficulty of the vWM tasks. This is in accordance with a previous study which showed these parts of the cerebellum to respond to changes in vWM load (Kirschen et al.,  ). As stated before, there are anatomical connections between these parts of the cerebellum and frontal areas. Hence, the increased input from frontal regions involved in the articulatory system during a load manipulation could also reflect the increased activation of the right cerebellum. In addition, we found an association between load and activation in the fusiform gyrus. Tsapkini and Rapp ( ) pointed out that lesions of the left fusiform gyrus were significantly associated with reading and spelling deficits. In light of this finding, the positive correlation between load and activation in the left fusiform gyrus in the present study might indicate that a majority of people may have used overt rehearsal as a strategy to cope with increasing task difficulty. \n\nIt has long been recognized that RT is sensitive to manipulations of any kind of WM load (Just and Carpenter,  ). Therefore, RT can also be viewed as a measure of load. A previous study found a significant positive correlation between RT and fMRI signal in nine subjects in the MFG and the left IFG (Braver et al.,  ). The present meta-analysis partially corroborates these findings showing both the left MFG and the left precentral gyrus to be positively associated with RT. However, our results seem to contradict a study by Honey et al. ( ), which reported that posterior parietal cortical activation was predicted by a prolonged RT in a vWM task. Importantly though, as states earlier, activation in the parietal cortex is influenced by load, which\u2014in turn is related to RT. Moreover, the present meta-analysis revealed a positive association between left precentral gyrus activation and RT. This finding is plausible considering that the left precentral gyrus constitutes a major part of the primary motor area and its activation is contralateral to the side of the hand movement. Hence, increased activation in the primary motor cortex might facilitate faster responding. It should be emphasized that RT information was not available for all studies. Moreover, RT depends on many other factors such as number of responses alternatives, type of discrimination or delay time. Therefore, results of this factor should be treated with caution. \n\nAlthough we performed a meta-analysis in which only fMRI studies were included, there has been a previous meta-analysis in which they selected both fMRI and PET studies to isolate the neural correlates of human working memory (Wager and Smith,  ). Although they found some support for left frontal cortex dominance in vWM tasks, this was only for tasks with low executive demand. These results support our finding regarding the lateralization, i.e., the higher the difficulty on the task, the less lateralization of PFC activation is to be expected. \n\nFinally, we expected the type of fMRI paradigm to be a significant moderator as demonstrated in a previous meta-analysis (Rottschy et al.,  ). This expectation was not met by the data. This could be due to a strong overlap in task activation, with potentially existing subtle quantity differences being too weak to be significant. We also found that gender did not affect activation associated with vWM tasks. However, we cannot exclude that gender differences would emerge when controlling for effects of sex hormones. Hence, future studies are required that carefully consider these potentially confounding factors. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIn the present meta-analysis we discussed a number of relevant networks based on fMRI activity, such as the attentional system, but we did not take into account brain connectivity. However, the localization of brain areas is just the first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the neural correlates of vWM. Analyses based on temporal dynamics, such as EEG or single-unit recordings, are essential to build a more integrative view. Another limitation regards our cerebellum findings. There is strong reason to assume that we did not find any inferior cerebellum activation because some of the scans included in the present meta-analysis did not cover the whole cerebellum due to methodological limitations (e.g., trade-off between brain coverage and repetition time). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe used a coordinate-based meta-analysis to integrate the current literature on vWM in healthy humans. We found activation of the established fronto-parietal network and the right cerebellum, especially crus I, and lobule VI. Our results support the dual-selection model, according to which a mid-lateral PFC activation occurs due to verbal input. Moreover, our results illustrate that we should not underestimate the activation of subcortical regions that play an important role for response inhibition. Age, mean RT, and load moderate vWM task activation and, thus, should be taken into consideration in future research. Especially the influencing factor of age should be further analyzed since the sample included in the present meta-analysis consists of primarily young people. Mean reaction time, moreover, could be influenced by many other factors. Further, more fine-grained studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the neural correlates underlying processes involved in vWM including encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nME, CB, and KK contributed to the conception and design of the study.

Despite being harshly criticized in the past for failing to demonstrate robust correlations with behavioral measures, currently this construct is attracting a resurgent interest in cognitive neuroscience. Therefore, an updated examination of the validity of this construct is timely. A corpus of peer-reviewed literature was analyzed through meta-analysis, which compared the two main formats used to measure vividness [trial-by-trial vividness ratings (VR) and the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]. These two formats were compared in relation to all available behavioral\/cognitive (BC) and neuroscience (NS) measures in Phase 1 (3542 statistical observations representing 393 journal articles); and then in relation to all available BC, EEG and fMRI literature in Phase 2 (3624 observations representing 402 articles). Both Phases observed significantly larger effect size estimates (ESEs) for VR than VVIQ, and larger ESEs for NS than BC measures. ESEs for EEG and fMRI were not significantly different in Phase 2, but were greater than BC ESEs. These data suggest VR are a more reliable self-report measure than VVIQ, and may reflect a more direct route of reportability than the latter. Furthermore, both VR and VVIQ are more strongly associated with the neural, than the cognitive and behavioural correlates of imagery. If one establishes neuroscience measures as the criterion variable, then self-reports of vividness show higher construct validity than behavioural\/cognitive measures of imagery. We discuss how the present findings contribute to current issues on measurement of reportability; and how this study advances our understanding of vividness as a phenomenological characteristic of imagery, and other forms of conscious experience which do not necessarily involve imagery. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVisual mental imagery refers to the subjective experience of a percept-like pattern in the absence of a relevant physical stimulus on the retina ( ;  ). Historically,   was the first to observe that the \u201cdetail and clarity with which individuals experience mental imagery\u201d involves an individual difference gradient across a population, which he operationally defined as \u201cvividness.\u201d While much progress has been achieved in clarifying the neural and information processing nature of mental imagery, dimensions such as vividness, which concern the phenomenal experience of imagery, have potentially been neglected by contemporary cognitive psychology. Indeed, after  , in the last 15 years very few examples can be found in the literature attempting to readdress this topic and its ambiguousness [see  ] or situate it within the broader arena of consciousness research [see  ]. Correspondingly, it seems very little progress has been made in terms of a complete account of mental imagery which offers a constructive integration of its component dimensions \u2013 cognitive, affective, neural, and phenomenological [the term \u201cconstructive\u201d is borrowed from  ]. \n\nLack of progress in this direction is surprising, given that no author ever denies the experiential aspects of imagery (or, similarly, that vividness of imagery is relevant to the scientific study of inner experience). On the contrary, experiential aspects of mental imagery continue to be used circularly, and ubiquitously for defining the psychological status and relevance of mental imagery [for both points, see  ]. For example, imagery paradigms that require subjects to provide an observable objective behavior (e.g. a button press) in response to generating, holding or transforming images rely on subjects being aware that they are experiencing an image. Thus, objective responses during imagery tasks are incontrovertibly entangled with the report of phenomenological awareness [see  ]. Because conscious phenomenal awareness of the imagery experience is constitutive of what is reported (the content of conscious experience), the button press or other behavioral measures are not independent of the reported content ( ). In other words, there is no independent way of telling whether the button press or other behavioral measures involve visual mental imagery, unless the latter experience is explicitly reported by the subject. This type of circularity is generally acknowledged in the broader context within the study of visual consciousness ( ;  ). \n\nIn the \u201cimagery debate,\u201d two contending approaches provide the best accounts for several aspects of imagery, and still remain the most influential cognitive psychology approaches to its study. According to  \u2019s \u201cpictorial theory,\u201d visual mental images are constructed from depictive representations, which come into play at higher stages of visual information processing during actual perception. According to  \u2019s \u201ctacit knowledge,\u201d experimental data on visual mental images simply reflect different instances of what people implicitly know or believe about how they perceive. Although Kosslyn and Pylyshyn do not explicitly acknowledge, or refer to the vividness construct overtly in their theories, and both authors might even summarily dismiss the relevance of the vividness construct, they allude to it at several critical junctions in their explanatory arguments, as evidenced by the following examples. \n\nIn discussing the mental scanning paradigm and the size of mental images, to illustrate what tacit knowledge involves,  , p. 163) repeatedly refers to \u201cdetails\u201d represented in images and \u201cblurry\u201d versus \u201cclear\u201d images. These adjectives epitomize the two terms used to describe vividness, according to the classical definition of vividness in psychology ( ,  ;  ; note the historical reference has been introduced by the authors of the current paper, Pylyshyn did not mention it). Consequently, at least some of his key conclusions about self-reports assume the validity of the vividness measure is sufficient. \n\nOn the other hand, in a paper that set the methodology benchmark for a series of fMRI studies showing activation of V1 by visual imagery,   use the word vividness when describing their mental imagery model based on Hebb\u2019s cell assembly hypothesis; especially, in framing some aspects of their data. For example, when discussing the controversy concerning the reinterpretation of mental images ( ), these authors argue that past imagery reinterpretation tasks may have required high-resolution images. Cues were effective in facilitating reinterpretation because their \u201c\u2026 images were not very vivid\u201d ( , p. 286). Additionally, these authors defend another conclusion carefully stating that \u201c\u2026 additional effort is required in imagery to represent visual patterns with high resolution.\u201d However, resolution and vividness were equated earlier in the article: \u201ctranslated in our present understanding, more vivid images would occur when stored information activates lower areas, which have higher spatial resolution than do higher areas\u201d ( , p. 277). Correspondingly, at least some of the supporting explanations used by Kosslyn   et al.   go circularly back to vividness. \n\nEven if these authors do not acknowledge vividness as a classical and contemporary psychological construct, it is nonepiphenomenal in the context of their explanations, and cannot be eliminated, nor refuted at present. In addition, a number of imagery researchers have shown that properties available to self-report, such as the ones typically included in definitions of vividness can reflect the resolution of the visual buffer [see  ;  ]. Furthermore, at the crossroads with imagery \u2013 episodic memory and cognitive neuroscience \u2013 some investigators use self-report variables such as Paivio\u2019s imageability ( ), or other contextual variables in their experiments ( ) as an indirect way to observe, interpret, and discuss the underlying vividness of the cognitive event. Thus, it seems that contentions toward the validity of the vividness construct do not take in consideration subtle differences in how vividness is actually measured, or what vividness actually means. Reexamination of the construct of vividness is timely also because multiple versions of essentially a similar latent construct are increasingly being used in different areas of neuroscience and psychology related to, but other than mental imagery, such as prospective and episodic memory ( ), and aging ( ). Vividness is increasingly becoming a central topic for phenomenological, neurobiological, and genetic links between visual memory and emotion ( ). Thus, the concept has the potential to advance many fields of research, but presumably for structural and historical constraints, transdisciplinary integration of advances in knowledge seems to progress inductively, from more specific, particular topics (case in point, vividness in imagery) to the general (consciousness). \n\nWith such transdisciplinary background in mind, the purpose of the present article is to update the status of vividness. We attempt to achieve the goal by working toward a new way to substantiate the construct with empirically demonstrated validity, which includes current findings from neuroscience, among other different disciplines. Our approach to the study of the validity of vividness, however, is based on \u201creference\u201d rather than \u201cmeaning\u201d ( ). From this perspective, the crucial issue is not what \u201cvividness really means,\u201d but rather, to what extent our subjective measures of imagery vividness work; namely, whether they measure the intended core latent attribute of inner conscious experience that comes with having visual mental images. Therefore, we already make the prior assumption that there does exist, in reality, an attribute that one designates when using the term \u201cvividness.\u201d Following this approach, the issue of validity can be reduced to whether a measurement instrument is sensitive to variations of the assumed attribute ( ). Namely, the question becomes: what do subjective vividness instruments really measure? \n\nTo find out what is measured, one has to find out how the instrument works. Accordingly, the development of any construct requires the refinement of its operational definition, namely, defining the range of variation of the underlying assumed attribute, such that it can be calibrated more precisely against related psychological and neurophysiological variables ( ). For example, to illustrate one of the most relevant ambiguity that has been identified over the years, although vividness is operationally defined by the key words \u201cdetail\u201d and \u201cclarity,\u201d   observed a neurophysiological distinction between the vividness of a memory and the detail a memory possesses, as they relate to brain activation patterns. Such ubiquity could be interpreted as contradictory, but from the empirical point of view just confirms earlier phenomenological findings, that across several different instruction conditions, people seem to heed to, and report on, both an intensive aspect of the sensory strength of their images (or \u201cclarity,\u201d generally described as brightness and color) and the level of precision or \u201cdetail\u201d discerned within them ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAs two very recent landmark studies show, the ubiquity that seems associated with the construct of vividness almost invariably reflects empirical variations in individual differences. On the one hand, it has been shown the overlap in neural activation (especially in the early primary visual cortex, V1) between imagery and perception is directly, positively correlated with trial by trial vividness ratings (VR) and imagery ability ( ). On the other hand, individual differences in the imagery experience are found to vary according to the two inversely correlated attributes associated with the size of V1. Individuals with above-average V1 size experience higher detailedness but lower sensory strength, whereas individuals with below-average V1 size show the opposite pattern (Bergman   et al.   2016). But most important, performance and verbal reports by the majority of people, with average V1 size, reflect a relative mixture of those two visual features of images. \n\nPrevious phenomenological and behavioral (Reaction Times modeling) evidence confirms the trend in the majority of the observers, and based on the weight of this evidence combined with neurophysiological data ( ;  ) some authors defend that it seems reasonable to assume as a definition of vividness the most exhaustive subjective conscious experience of imagery, in terms of both amount of detail (resolution) and sensory strength of a mental image, relative to the experience of actual seeing. The latter operational working definition is the frame of reference for the tests of validity proposed in this article. \n\nA line of thinking about validity similar to the one just discussed has led to some of the strongest arguments demarking the necessity and objectifiability of self-reports in cognitive neuroscience, and consciousness research more generally. Particularly relevant is   analysis of the \u201ctriangulation\u201d in consciousness research; namely, the convergent use of introspective, behavioral and neurophysiological evidence. As they argued, empirical validity of introspective reports cannot be only established by examining the relationship between reported vividness and other objective behavioral measures (e.g. memory accuracy). Rather, empirical validity should be based on the relationship between neural correlates of perceived vividness and reported vividness at the first-person level. Without considering perceived vividness (what the person is actually experiencing), the fact that reported vividness may not correlate with behavior does not refute the validity of the vividness construct. Crucially, reported vividness may still be strongly correlated with the neural correlates of perceived vividness experience. Because vividness was defined \u223c130 years ago, and its main synthetic assessment [the meta-analysis by  ] did not include current neuroscience findings, the construct requires an updated reconsideration as to what it actually means in the fields of consciousness and imagery at present. This effort may accommodate novel, contemporary conceptualizations concerning the nature of memory ( ), or even new knowledge regarding the neural basis of consciousness, such as the default mode network ( ). \n\nIn addition, as a psychological construct, vividness requires convergent and discriminative validation through empirical, objective testing. For instance, vividness has been positively correlated with performance on perceptual and memory tasks ( ;  ;  ), arousal level ( ;  ), and sleep stages ( ), even though it is debated whether or not it is correlated with certain dynamic spatial tasks like mental rotation ( ;  ). Moreover, a growing body of research suggests VR correlate with neural modulations in specific brain regions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which covary with the phenomenological ratings offered by participants. \n\nPerhaps the most commonly used global assessment of imagery ability is the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ;  ;  ;  ) and its successor the VVIQ2 ( ;  ). The VVIQ provides a global assessment of vividness, and is typically used to categorize participants according to the individual differences in visual imagery ability. It consists of 16 items, which are to be rated on a five-point scale from (1) \u201cperfectly clear and as vivid a normal vision,\u201d to (5) \u201cno image at all, you only \u2018know\u2019 that you are thinking of the object.\u201d The versatility of the VVIQ is such that it can be administered before, during, or after experimental manipulations, and demonstrates sufficient retest and internal reliability ( ). \n\nAlternatively, vividness may be rated on a \u201ctrial-by-trial\u201d VR basis through a single response, which corresponds to the subjective experience at a particular moment in time, structurally constrained by what types of images participants are required to form. In addition to methodological advantages,   argue that trial-by-trial VR are perhaps the most effective means by which imagery vividness can be studied (e.g.  ). Similarly, participants are prompted with a scale such as that used in the VVIQ, wherein vividness is rated from (1) \u201cno image,\u201d to (5) \u201cperfectly vivid\u201d (albeit the scale can range from 1 to 3, 1 to 7, 1 to 100, etc.). A major contention concerning the use of VVIQ is that global assessments offered through surveys of group differences in mental imagery ability may describe too coarsely, or even miss specific cognitive and neural processes affiliated with the phenomenological experience of vividness occurring within each trial ( ). \n\nThe reliability of vividness, as a construct presumed to reflect identifiable and separable processes, is largely undermined through the use of a single test score, such as the one offered by the VVIQ, or global assessments of imagery ability more generally ( ). In contrast, experimental procedures employing VR may procure more reliable patterns of results and interpretations than those employing the VVIQ ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). If VR are observed in structured experimental settings, and participants are given clear instructions as to the nature of the task, VR may resolve critically informative and specific aspects concerning the subjective experience of the imagery processes ( ). In this way, VR are a type of retrospective verbal report ( ), which can be put in correspondence with decomposable task-related behavior and neural processes. Accordingly, VR is compatible with the principle of \u201creportability,\u201d i.e., the more general condition with which the levels and contents of phenomenal conscious awareness in visual working memory can be properly defined and investigated ( ;  ). \n\nExperimental results which are based on behavioral, cognitive, or neuroscience types of measures are assumed to produce effects which vary in their relative sizes; however, there has been no systematic quantitative comparison that evaluates the claim, nor offers an evidence-based indication as to whether vividness provides weak or robust data [for a complete account of this debate, see  ]. Adopting a meta-analysis approach offers the opportunity to formulate a set of clear and straightforward hypotheses and predictions that could be put forward to empirical testing. Because VRs resolve critical aspects of, and measure a greater subset of the variability in the mental imagery experience, they may systematically demonstrate greater content validity than the VVIQ within behavioral, cognitive, and neuroscience experimental paradigms ( ;  ;  ;  ). Accordingly, one would expect larger effect sizes for VR [see  ]. If VR resolve phenomenological aspects of mental imagery to a greater degree than the VVIQ (i.e. they are more exhaustive), then the reported effect sizes pertaining to VR should be greater in magnitude than the effect sizes associated with the VVIQ, when averaged over a large and representative sample of relevant literature. To test this first key hypothesis, in the present meta-analysis, VR were compared against all available behavioral, cognitive, and neuroscience imagery measures throughout a robust and representative sample of literature with the VVIQ providing the criterion variable against which self-reports are traditionally compared and validated ( ). \n\nThe viability of an evidence-based approach to mental imagery is one which is theoretically driven by and supported through neurocomputational modeling ( ). In addition, neuroimaging experiments typically exhibit a great amount of control and precision ( ). Thus, the second hypothesis tested through the present meta-analysis was that neuroscience measures may resolve critical aspects of the mental imagery experience more reliably than behavioral and or cognitive ones, and as result, it would be possible to conclude that vividness may be more thoroughly validated as an independent and empirical construct through neuroscience approaches. If neuroscientific measures are capable of resolving phenomenological vividness more closely than behavioral and or cognitive ones, then the prediction follows that the reported magnitude of effect sizes which are neuroscience should be greater than those which are behavioral and or cognitive. Specifically, VRs should also be greater than the VVIQ for effect sizes which are associated with neuroscience measurements. The latter outcome would entail a broader implication in terms of how conscious verbal reports of imagery could be conceptualized. That is, imagery reportability may be associated with two routes, a \u201cdirect\u201d route, represented by VRs, and an indirect one, represented by VVIQ. Following   general typologies of verbal protocols, it would be reasonable to interpret the predicted pattern as an indication that VR and VVIQ may reflect two different processing routes supporting retrospective verbal reports as postulated in the schemas shown in  . Like other types of retrospective reports, VR are obtained by asking subjects about a neurocognitive process which recently occurred. It is reasonable that in structured conditions, in which VR are collected, the image contents may be accessed through a relatively more direct route, with minimal verbal recoding and delay that reflect predominantly or exclusively task-relevant information and processes ( , right panel). Conversely, in the case of VVIQ, VR may require additional scanning, filtering, inference or rule-based and metacognitive processes; as a result, verbalization may mediate or even modify the imagery experience revealing information or knowledge that goes beyond or is not relevant to processes underlying the task ( , left panel). \n  \nSchematic models representing types of VR (left panel: VVIQ; right panel: trial-by-trial VR) as particular cases of two retrospective verbal report processing routes, adapted from  . Like other types of retrospective reports, VR are obtained by asking subjects about a process which occurred recently. This figure shows the cases similar to introspection, in which VR requires scanning, filtering, inference, or rule-based processes, thus verbalization mediates or even modifies the imagery task. \n  \nA third hypothesis may also be derived as a possible contingency from the first two, if the presence of a significant interaction is observed between Vividness and Measure factors, it may represent a differential propensity for VR\/VVIQ within the behavioral\/cognitive (BC) and\/or NS dimensions. Because the effect sizes for VR are hypothesized to exceed those of the VVIQ for both BC and NS measurements, failing to reject the null hypothesis for the interaction effect would imply the strongest form of convergent validation, and support for the first two hypotheses. \n\n\n## Method: Phase 1 \n  \n### Sampling \n  \nA corpus of peer-reviewed journal articles representing a robust subset of the relevant literature available through the databases Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PsycINFO were retrieved through our University\u2019s library on October 25th, 2012.   A priori   criteria restricted the search results to those of the English language, to those published after 1950, and those using human subjects. Given the current major issues concerning the inclusion of \u201cgrey literature\u201d \u2013 such as poorer research quality, search un-standardization, data duplication and\/or incompleteness, minimal reliability improvement at cost of major energy\/resource search expenditure [see extensive review in  ] \u2013 theses, dissertations, and other unpublished works were deliberately avoided (a more detailed rationale for this decision contextualized to the present study is given in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d section). Data for Phase 1 are available upon request. \n\nSearch parameters included the general terms \u201cvivid* and image*\u201d, as well as additional syntax employed to minimize the discovery of irrelevant papers (see  ). A total of 1290 journal articles were discovered (Web of Knowledge, 36; Scopus, 34; Embase, 188; PsycINFO, 1032), and exported to RefWorks, wherein 320 duplicates were observed and deleted from the corpus. The remaining 970 journal articles were systematically analyzed in relation to their relevance to the research question. Those which did not include at least one relevant statistical outcome relating either vividness ratings (VR) and\/or VVIQ to another variable were not considered further, of which there were 577. From the remaining 393 papers that contained at least one relevant statistical outcome, each and every statistical outcome relating either VR and\/or VVIQ to another variable was recorded into a database, as it appeared in the original journal article. \n\n\n### Data trimming and data analysis \n  \nUpon inclusion into the database, every statistical outcome was categorized as either VR or VVIQ, and further categorized as either BC, or neuroscience (NS). A total of 3697 statistical outcomes were observed from the 393 papers included, which were organized into four focal categories (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20091826; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20091680; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200982; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u200962), and one peripheral category consisting of observations which directly correlated VR with VVIQ (  n  \u2009=\u200947). \n\nEach statistical outcome was transformed from its original statistical metric into the form of the correlation coefficient (  r  ), from which absolute Fisher\u2019s   Z   transformed score were computed. Statistical outcomes for which   r   could not be calculated were excluded from the analysis (  n  \u2009=\u2009108), such as beta-values (  n  \u2009=\u200973),   t  ,   F  ,   r, U  , and   q   values which did not included sufficient information (  n  \u2009=\u200935). Because scaling phenomenological ratings from 1 (low) to 5 (high), has the exact opposite meaning as scaling phenomenological ratings from 5 (low) to 1 (high), rearranging statistical outcomes to accommodate the scaling   post priori   was methodologically difficult. Subsequently, the present research abandoned directionality and transformed   Z   vector quantities to their absolute, scalar   Z   form. Observations directly measuring VR and VVIQ together were considered separately, such that an average correlation could be isolated. \n\nData were modeled with a series of three-level meta-analysis ( ;  ). Traditional meta-analytic approaches assume independence in the effect sizes ( ). As there are 3697 effect sizes nested within 393 studies in the present meta-analysis, statistical inferences of traditional meta-analysis are incorrect. Three-level meta-analysis enables researchers to implement an additional cluster effect (dependence within the same study). Although ignoring dependence is not recommended, aggregating multiple statistical outcomes into one summary statistic can likewise be problematic ( ), as it may afford larger standard errors affiliated with parameter estimates, and generally contributes to a high attrition rate (loss of sample size). As such, the present research necessitated a more precise and accommodating meta-analytic framework to answer the primary research question in Phase 2. Data were analyzed using R software, with the \u201cmetaSEM\u201d package ( ). The level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances represent the within- and between-study heterogeneity variances, respectively. If the level-2 heterogeneity variance is large, it means that the reported effect sizes also vary within the same study. \n\nCorrespondingly, data for VR  (  n  \u2009=\u20091760) represented 238 experiments from 194 journal articles, VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u20091640) represented 248 experiments from 212 journal articles, VR  (  n  \u2009=\u200980) represented 13 experiments from 13 journal articles, and VVIQ  (  n\u2009  =\u200962) represented 7 experiments from 7 journal articles. A 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 2 (BC, NS) study design was used to test the abovementioned research hypotheses (i) effect sizes on VR are larger than those on VVIQ; (ii) effect sizes on NS are larger than those on BC; and (iii) there is an interaction between these two factors. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA preliminary analysis was first performed, wherein a three-level meta-analytic framework was employed to determine the overall effect size estimate (ESE), and parameter estimates for the entire dataset. The average ESE (  Z  ) with its 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) was 0.4011 [0.3795, 0.4227], where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0434 and 0.0404, respectively. The test on the null hypothesis of equality of population level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances is not statistically significant, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20090.4913,   P\u2009=\u2009  0.4833. The percentage of variation accounted for at level-2 and level-3 (  I  ) were 0.4572 and 0.4249, respectively. This indicates the effect sizes have similar degree of variation within and between studies. Subsequently, a moderator variable was created for each focal category, and the data from each focal category were subjected to an independent three-level meta-analytic framework, such that an internal ESE for each category could be calculated. The ESE and parameter estimates for the four focal categories are presented in   and  . In comparison to the overall model, the effect of the moderator variables was statistically significant, \u03c7  (3)\u2009=\u200965.03,   P\u2009  <\u20090.001.\n   \nDescriptive statistics for phase 1, including the number of statistical outcomes, number of journal articles, number of experiments, ESEs, and 95% Wald CIs for each category \n  \n  \nInternal ESEs for each of the four categories in Phase 1, and their 95% Wald CIs. Also plotted are the predicted values from the regression analysis (dotted lines), which are based on the model without the interaction.   Note  : the 95% Wald CIs are based on the estimated values (not the predicted values). \n  \nA 2 Vividness (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 2 Measure (BC, NS) design was used to test the research hypotheses with a mixed-effects meta-analysis. The interaction between Vividness and Measure was not statistically significant \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20091.71,   P   = 0.19, which indicated that the effect of Vividness and Measure was additive. In other words, the effect of Vividness is independent of the effect of Measure (and vice versa). We may independently interpret the effects of Vividness and Measure. When there is an interaction, however, the effect of Vividness depends on the level of Measure (and vice versa). We need to select the level of Measure when we interpret the effect of Vividness (and vice versa). Both Vividness and Measures were significant \u03c7  (2)\u2009=\u200963.31,   P   < 0.001, level-3   R  \u2009=\u20090.182. The ESE for VR was statistically greater than VVIQ (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.133, 95% Wald CI [0.093, 0.173]), after controlling the effect of Measure. NS was statistically greater than BC (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.257, 95% Wald CI [0.150, 0.364]), after controlling the effect of Vividness. Finally, concerning the peripheral analysis examining the direct relationship between VR and VVIQ, the results from 47 effect sizes nested within 19 studies using a three-level meta-analysis suggests an ESE of 0.3977 (0.2886, 0.5069), where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0260 and 0.0293, respectively. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results from the Phase 1 offered significant insight into the ESEs for each of the four focal categories. Although the differences between VR and VVIQ appear to be robust within the BC dimension, the differences within the NS dimension were not as clear cut. Nevertheless, the peripheral category directly correlating VR and VVIQ suggests a weak to moderate relationship. Comparisons concerning the NS dimension did not resolve any differences between VR and VVIQ; however, this effect may have remained unresolved for at least two reasons. First, standard error (SE) within each of the NS focal categories was larger than those within the BC focal categories, which resulted from a much smaller sample size, and a much larger estimate of within study variance (  \u1e7d\u2019  ). Secondly, between-study heterogeneity (  \u03c4  ) was generally larger within the NS focal categories. \n\nTwo strategies were implemented to homogenize the NS focal categories. First, because no future searches indicated additional evidence pertaining to PET (  n  \u2009=\u20095), NIRS (  n  \u2009=\u20096), or pharmacological NS (  n  \u2009=\u20094) neuroscience outcomes, and to avoid overestimating between study error, only fMRI (  n  \u2009=\u200973), and EEG (  n  \u2009=\u200954) were selected as representative to the NS sample. Incidentally, this methodological conceptualization may lend insight into temporal specific (EEG) and spatial specific (fMRI) variations in neurophysiological measurement within this construct. If indicative, a differential propensity for the NS dimension may be observed between fMRI and EEG, a pattern of which should be emergent between both VR and VVIQ. Secondly, another systematic literature search was performed to acquire previously undiscovered journal articles pertaining to VR and VVIQ in the context of NS, but specifically those relating to fMRI and\/or EEG. \n\n\n## Method: Phase 2 \n  \n### Sampling \n  \nIn an effort to clarify the meaning of the NS data specifically, an exhaustive systematic search was performed, which sought to discover any and all journal articles relating VR and\/or VVIQ to EEG and\/or fMRI. Four strategies were employed. First, PsychINFO was searched on July 20th, 2015, using the specific parameters \u201cvivid* fMRI\u201d, and \u201cvivid* EEG\u201d, from which six novel journal articles were discovered ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) resulting in 37 novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200930; VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20094; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20093; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Similar searches through PsychINFO for VVIQ did not return any results. \n\nSecond, the entire library catalog in our institution was searched on July 20th, 2015 using the specific parameters \u201cVVIQ fMRI,\u201d and \u201cVVIQ EEG,\u201d from which three novel journal articles were discovered ( ;  ;  ), resulting in 27 novel observations (VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20096; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u200921). \n\nThird, the discussion sections of all relevant papers were read, and references were recorded for comparisons the authors sought to explain their findings. This resulted in an additional two novel journal articles ( ;  ), resulting in 29 novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u200928; VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20091; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Finally, a journal article known to be relevant ( ), and published in a pilot study through this research group, and not found in any other search was also included, resulting in four novel observations (VR ,   n  \u2009=\u20094; VR ,   n\u2009  =\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090; VVIQ ,   n  \u2009=\u20090). Data for Phase 2 are available upon request. \n\n\n### Data trimming and data analysis \n  \nThe novel fMRI and EEG data from Phase 2 were compiled with existing fMRI and EEG data from Phase 1. Subsequently, the entire NS database consisted of 224 observations. Data for VR  (  n  \u2009=\u2009102) represented 13 experiments from 13 journal articles, VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u200943) represented eight experiments from eight journal articles, VR  (  n  \u2009=\u200935) represented six experiments from six journal articles, and VVIQ  (  n  \u2009=\u200944) represented four experiments from four journal articles. BC data from Phase 1 were also borrowed from Phase 1, resulting in a 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 (BC, EEG, fMRI) study design. Phase 2 data were modeled in the same way as Phase 1. A 2 (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 (BC, EEG, fMRI) study design was used to test the abovementioned research hypotheses (i) effect sizes on VR are larger than those on VVIQ; (ii) effect sizes on EEG and fMRI are larger than those on BC; and (iii) there is an interaction between these two factors. \n\nDuring the interval of time required for peer-review, a final library search was conducted to double check that the database was still representative of the very latest publications. The search revealed that only three new (fMRI) papers published during the peer-review lag ( ;  ;  ) fitting the inclusion criteria were not included in our revised analysis. All the data points from these papers were observed to fall within the 95% CIs calculated in Phase 2 ( ).\n   \nDescriptive statistics for phase 2, including the number of statistical outcomes, number of journal articles, number of experiments, ESEs, and 95% Wald CIs for each category \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA preliminary analysis was first performed, wherein a three-level meta-analytic framework was employed to determine the overall ESE, and parameter estimates for the entire dataset. The average ESE (  Z  ) with its 95% Wald CI was 0.4080 [0.3854, 0.4306], where the level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances (\u03c4 ) were 0.0427 and 0.0472, respectively. The test on the null hypothesis of equality of population level-2 and level-3 heterogeneity variances is not statistically significant, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20091.03,   P\u2009=\u2009  0.31. Therefore, the percentage of variation accounted for at level-2 and level-3 (  I  ) were 0.4214 and 0.4660, respectively. This indicates the effect sizes have similar degree of variation within and between studies. Subsequently, a moderator variable was created for each focal category, and the data from each focal category were subjected to an independent three-level meta-analytic framework, such that an internal ESE for each category could be calculated. The ESE and parameter estimates for the six focal categories are presented in   and  . In comparison to the overall model, the effect of the moderator variables was statistically significant, \u03c7  (5)\u2009=\u200976.77,   P\u2009  <\u20090.001. \n  \nInternal ESEs for each of the six categories in Phase 2, and their 95% Wald CIs. Also plotted are the predicted values from the regression analysis (dotted lines), which are based on the model without the interaction.   Note  : the 95% Wald CIs are based on the estimated values (not the predicted values). \n  \nA 2 Vividness (VR, VVIQ) \u00d7 3 Measure (BC, EEG, fMRI) design was used to test the research hypotheses with a mixed-effects meta-analysis. The interaction between Vividness and Measure was not statistically significant \u03c7  (2)\u2009=\u20091.14,   P   = 0.57, which indicated that the effect of Vividness and Measure was additive. In other words, the effect of Vividness is independent of the effect of Measure (and vice versa). Both Vividness and Measures were significant \u03c7  (3)\u2009=\u200975.63,   P   < 0.001, level-3   R  \u2009=\u20090.214. The ESE for VR was statistically greater than VVIQ (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.137, 95% Wald CI [0.095, 0.178]), after controlling the effect of Measure. By using BC as the reference group, EEG was statistically greater than BC (\u0394  Z  \u2009=\u20090.229, 95% Wald CI [0.079, 0.379]), and the predicted ESE for fMRI was likewise statistically greater than BC (  \u0394Z  \u2009=\u20090.297, 95% Wald CI [0.184, 0.410], after controlling the effect of Vividness. There was no difference between the ESE for EEG and the ESE for fMRI, \u03c7  (1)\u2009=\u20090.52,   p\u2009=\u2009  0.47. \n\n\n## General Discussion \n  \nThe present research analyzed a robust and representative subset of literature in an effort to understand the relationship between trial-by-trial VR and VVIQ, within the context of behavioral\/cognitive (BC) and neuroscience (NS) experimental paradigms in Phase 1, and within the context of BC, EEG, and fMRI experimental paradigms in Phase 2. \n\nThrough the preliminary analysis in Phase 1, a significant difference between the ESEs for VR and VVIQ in the context of BC experimentation was observed. This result is limited in so far as we assume the effect sizes used to create the database have the same statistical meaning, and that there are no systematic differences between the way in which VR and VVIQ are implemented in research. For example, it is possible that VVIQ is more conducive to between-groups comparison, and VR more conducive to within-group comparisons, which may imply the latter has inherently greater effect sizes. It is unlikely, however, that this limitation can account for the differences which were observed across these multiple domains of psychology and neuroscience. For example, the average correlation between VR and VVIQ was generally weak (  r   \u223c 0.40), for two measures which purportedly \u201cmeasure\u201d the same thing [note the correlation reported here is similar to the one reported by  ]. Although differences between VR and VVIQ were observed in Phase 1, the methodology utilized in Phase 2 sought to homogenize, and increase the sample size of the NS dimension, such that differences between the ESEs for VR and VVIQ could be observed within the NS dimension as well. \n\nThe statistical methodology employed in Phase 2 was designed to evaluate the data at different levels. Data were first analyzed at an overall level, then analyzed at theoretically determined levels, which were represented by six independent categories belonging to BC, EEG, or fMRI experimental types. The three-level meta-analysis provides a correct statistical model to handle multiple effect sizes nested within studies ( ). The ESE, when calculated over the entire dataset was approximately   Zr  \u2009=\u20090.40. Interestingly, the level-2 and level-3 estimates of heterogeneity, or the proportion of variation accounted for at each level (  I  ), show a similar magnitude (\u223c0.42, and \u223c0.47, respectively). This finding may suggest just as much variation exists within experiments as between. Finally, the unique contributions of Vividness and Measure were tested by a three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis with the data from Phase 2. \n\nThe results did not support the interaction between Vividness and Measure. This seems to suggest that the effects of Vividness and Measures are additive. On the other hand, the results provided strong support for both major hypotheses. VR demonstrated larger ESEs than the VVIQ, when compared against a large and representative sample, and larger ESEs were also observed for EEG and fMRI when compared with BC. Although BC experimental paradigms generally result in smaller ESEs, no significant difference was observed between EEG and fMRI neuro-imaging experiment types; albeit, the small sample sizes do not lend to a strong conclusion. Although fMRI has a tendency to overinflate effect sizes in some psychological contexts ( ), presumably based on statistical power, and limitations arising from small sample sizes ( ), the results of the present analysis do not suggest the ESE for fMRI data deviate significantly from EEG data. However, differences between VR and VVIQ remained unobserved within the EEG dimension, as this level of analysis was presumably limited by very small sample sizes (six and four experiments, respectively). \n\nIn relation to other subjective measures used in consciousness research, vividness could be interpreted as the measurement of a specific type of conscious experience, correlate of imagery. Although there have been very few studies comparing imagery vividness to the different types of subjective scales used in consciousness research such as the perceptual awareness scale (PAS, e.g.  ) or confidence ratings (CR, e.g.,  ), few older studies (pre-dating PAS creation) which compared VR in perception and imagery seem to show robust relationships ( ;  ). Relatively more studies showed that VVIQ, and to some extent VR, are correlated with CR [see  , for review; see also  ] in that as people rate themselves as having relatively more vivid images, they are also more confident about their imagery-related ability and performance (and females do so more than males). In addition, in his meta-analysis   reported on a subset of 15 studies correlating VVIQ and objective responses and subjective judgments in perceptual tasks, with composite effect size of   r  \u2009=\u20090.45 [95% CI\u2009=\u20090.31, 0.56]. Thus, issues of reportability for subjective measures of awareness used in consciousness research can shed some insights into vividness as a characteristic of conscious experiences in general. As reviewed by  , the validity and reliability of subjective measures of conscious awareness can be assessed through a set of reportability criteria: \u201cexhaustiveness\u201d (of all relevant contents in consciousness) and \u201cexclusiveness\u201d (of relevant conscious processes but not unconscious or irrelevant conscious ones), as well as how \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cindirectly\u201d the scales, ratings or reports, measure these attributes in underlying processes as defined by reference to objective measurements. Similar criteria can be applied to VR and VVIQ to better understand vividness as an attribute of visual consciousness. Hence, where relevant in the following discussion, we will highlight points of connection and the reciprocal implications for vividness as type-specific imagery experience measure and as an attribute sharing aspects common to other forms of consciousness as measured by PAS, CR, and other subjective measures. \n\nIf we consider VR as an entire set of all phenomenological experiences we can probe (we can ask participants to rate the vividness of mental images generated in any number of single trials), the VVIQ can only approximate this set, as it makes a series of vividness measurements from a small, standardized subset of all possible mental images we can imagine. Albeit, the questions used in the VVIQ may be highly exemplary\/representative of the general vividness construct. According to this reasoning, the VVIQ is a robust subset of all VR. Although the 16 or 32 items on the VVIQ\/VVIQ2 possess excellent content validity, they cannot accommodate special circumstances in human psychological experience, like those concerning flash-bulb memories in PTSD, or vivid mental images as they relate to mental health more generally ( ). As such, the greater effect sizes observed for VR observations is likely the surplus of what the VVIQ cannot measure. If VR can be seen as a specific type of subjective awareness measure such as PAS or CR used in consciousness research, then VR can be said to be more \u201cexhaustive\u201d than VVIQ as a measure of the conscious states associated with imagery, in that it reveals most of the relevant knowledge of the conscious state experienced by the imager. \n\nIn comparison to BC, larger ESEs were observed for EEG and fMRI experimental paradigms, which may lend weight to the interpretation that, when behavioral and cognitive factors are ruled-out, something extra remains unexplained in the statistical model, yet is captured by neuroimaging studies. Vividness ratings can be captured on a millisecond to millisecond temporal basis (EEG), and in a millimeter to millimeter spatial basis (fMRI), in a way which most closely approximates the conscious \u201cpsychological\u201d experience of the mental image. NS experimental paradigms allow for the resolution of specific and intrinsic processes, closely following the human psychological experience of vividness, which is an otherwise unobservable phenomenon. Given this interpretation requires extensive support, Phase 2 was designed to exhaustively retrieve any and all evidence linking vividness to brain modulation. A series of searches afforded 29 relevant papers, representing 224 effect sizes, which were statistically modeled with a series of three-level meta-analyses. The three-level meta-analysis has high statistical power as it includes all effect sizes and models the dependence of the data properly. The significance of the present results is contingent on the weight of a corpus of BC experimentation, which showed a similar pattern, but with a much larger sample size \u2013 and thusly \u2013 contribution to the overall analysis. \n\nAs previously mentioned, one possible limitation to the present analysis may be that VR and VVIQ correspond to different methodological designs, and the inherent lack of heterogeneity between these measures may warrant careful reconsideration of the abovementioned interpretation. However, systematic differences in the way VR and VVIQ are administered, if any, are marginal at best, and cannot account for the present pattern of results. First, the correlation between the VVIQ and VR was weak to moderate. Secondly, the present argument can be thought of as a trade-off in the implementation of the VVIQ, where the convenience of administering a questionnaire (which measures trait ability) sacrifices resolution moment-to-moment. VRs seem to reasonably resolve the spectrum of variability in the mental imagery experience (which can be assumed to include measurement of both trait and state ability). It is this variability which can be more sensitively correlated to modulations in brain activity, which exist within a narrow temporal and\/or spatial window, the likes of which a questionnaire cannot impute. Just to clarify with an example, our scores on the VVIQ may very well be the same, but the vividness of events relating to my PTSD (if I suffered from it), would be wildly different than yours (if you did not). Such situational variability may be consistent with flash-bulb memories, pharmaceutical interventions, hallucinations, or dreams. Furthermore, we do acknowledge that the practical interpretability of the average effect size for each main category may be limited (for predictive purposes). However, the relativistic differences (VR\u2009>\u2009VVIQ) are sufficiently accurate, robust, withstanding replication and convergent validation. \n\nAnother potential limitation is that there is a disparity between the number of studies as well as the number of effect sizes in Phase I (VRBC,   n\u2009  =\u20091826; VVIQBC,   n  \u2009=\u20091680; VRNS,   n  \u2009=\u200982; VVIQNS,   n  \u2009=\u200962). This disparity indicates that traditionally BC has been much more studied than NS. The estimated average effects (VR versus VVIQ and BC versus NS) are still unbiased regardless of the disparity of the number of effect sizes. On the other hand, the estimated heterogeneity variances are likely biased toward BC as there are more studies in BC. \n\nThere are pros and cons of including unpublished studies in a meta-analysis.   argued against including unpublished studies. For example, unpublished studies are usually of weaker methodology. Moreover, the search for unpublished studies may also be biased due to the availability of unpublished studies to the authors. On the other hand,   provided counter arguments for including unpublished studies. They suggested unpublished studies may be excluded on the methodological rigorousness by using clearly defined inclusion criteria rather than excluding all unpublished studies. The present study only included effect sizes from published studies because we wanted to include peer-reviewed studies with rigorous methodology. However, we do not think that the presence of unpublished studies may alter our conclusions because there are more than 3600 effect sizes nested within about 400 studies. It is not feasible to find enough unpublished studies with null effect substantially changing our conclusions. \n\nIf one considers the totality of the available data in comparison to theoretically established categories, cluster\/types of research can be independently identified, and decomposed from the overall analysis. The entire BC dimension could, by necessity, be further reduced into cluster\/types (as were EEG and fMRI data decomposed from the Phase 1\u2009NS dimension), which can then be objectively compared, contrasted, and evaluated. In fact, the 32-month delay between the searches in both Phases represents a temporal necessity, allowing the collection of an incremental amount of literature pertaining to the spatial\/temporal imaging of vividness, which remains a specialist field of ongoing research debate. After this interval of time, enough literature was compiled to reflect trends previously observed within the BC dimension. The replication of low \u201coverall\u201d effect sizes throughout the BC subdimensions is a consistent finding; here, \u0394  Zr   (\u223c0.14) is estimated to be the general differential throughout every possible subset comparison of VR and VVIQ within the BC dimension. The estimation is supported at an overall level, theoretically relevant NS levels, and replicated in two previous smaller subset analyses ( ;  ). \n\nThe question is, then, at what \u201clevel\u201d does one want to cluster the BC subsets? At some point, researchers are required to make a conceptual distinction between two or more types of research within an overall dataset. Indeed, \u201cBehavioural\u201d experimentation compared to \u201cCognitive\u201d experimentation may be the simplest BC comparison one could make, the effect of which was already measured as 0.40 \u201coverall\u201d \u2013 the VRs \u223c 0.46, and the VVIQs \u223c 0.32. Conversely, if one wants to make absolutely no assumptions concerning heterogeneity, only direct correlations between VR and VVIQ can be considered valid comparisons (because they are within studies, and unambiguously summarize the relationship), the effect size of which is similarly \u223c0.40. Making relevant theoretical distinctions [qualified by theory, quantified by estimates of heterogeneity (\u03c4 )] enables meta-analysis. For example, by concentrating research efforts on peer-reviewed quality reports and filtering out the gray literature, an acceptable level of journal quality heterogeneity was assumed, which was defined by the requirement of empirically evaluated, evidenced-based research ( ). \n\nFundamentally, the consistent observation that ESEs for VR exceed those of VVIQ suggests convergent validation, and under such circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that VR is a more reliable self-report measure than VVIQ. In this context, however, we can go a step further and define \u201cmore reliable\u201d concretely in terms of underlying processes, which are related to reportability. That is, the present findings support the conclusion that VR offer a relatively more direct report of imagery, in that they may be more sensitive to immediate, unfiltered information about the visual qualities of mental images relevant to a task or a resting condition, and may show knowledge that is relatively more exclusive to sensory-perceptual consciousness. In contrast, VVIQ is more indirect, since it could include higher-order and metacognitive processes related to the self-judged expected ability to generate at will a visual image that corresponds to a complex scene (which includes relatively more abstract knowledge, and needs to be translated from a fairly complex verbal narrative). In many respects, the difference between VR and VVIQ parallels the difference between PAS and CR in consciousness research, where the former measure has been shown to be correlated more with perception than metacognition, whereas the latter shows the opposite pattern of correlation ( ). All the pros and cons of using PAS and CR, as those authors have well pointed out, also apply for VR and VVIQ. For example, both vividness measures might fail in being exclusive, because they might reflect information below the level the experimenter is interested in, or because unconscious processes may exert an influence by boosting or attenuating the ratings. However, it is unclear whether a \u201creverse subtractive logic\u201d can be pursued in comparing proportions of accounted variation in the data between VR and VVIQ, as it could be done for PAS and other subjective awareness measures. Could we infer that the differential \u201cunexplained\u201d variance between VR and VVIQ indicates underlying overflow conscious processes plus underlying unconscious processes? This is an interesting empirical question for future research. \n\nThe operational partition in neural and behavioural processes is a feature derived from the way the field has historically developed, and it reflects a legitimate reduction of the investigative approach: it is not practical, nor scientifically necessary to consider all possible variables and measures. However, it still remains that such partition is artificial. Phenomenology, neural, cognitive and behavioral processes are all components of an integrated system. The finding that both VR and VVIQ are more strongly associated with the neural components of imagery generation than the cognitive and behavioral ones implies that if neural measures are considered the third independent criterion of reference for validity, then VR, regardless of the route of reportability they implement \u2013 VR or VVIQ \u2013 may in some circumstances be more valid than behavioral (and cognitive) measures. The findings and theoretical implications of the present meta-analysis lend support to the view that typical findings in the literature which show low correlations between self-report and behavioral measures should not be necessarily interpreted as a weakness of the former, rather the latter. Studies that do not adopt a single behavioral measure as the gold standard and criterion variable, and use multiple formats of the construct of interest, show that construct validity coefficients of self-reports such as VR are invariably greater than their behavioral counterparts [see review in  ].As earlier noted by  , self-reports are an aspect of consciousness that needs to be established with brain patterns, to explain the nature of experience. Inevitably, they need to be understood. However, our \u201capproximation\u201d of what the sentient unit is experiencing at any particular moment in time grows as we fumble with reductionism, and deconstruction, consistent with an information-processing approach. Validity of vividness seems to be proportional to the correlation between vividness consciously experienced and vividness verbally reported, and it is a misjudgment to assume we cannot trust subject\u2019s verbal interpretations of their own conscious states. In other words, it is a misjudgment to assume that validity needs to be established only by robust correlations with behavioral measures. \n\nThe previous conclusion has all but a trivial implication since the data we have presented clearly do not support current approaches which call for \u201celiminating\u201d subjective measures, thereby only focusing on the relationship between behavioral and neural measures of conscious processes [see again  ]. Expanding on the Jack and Roepfstorff\u2019s triangulation challenge,  , p. 9) offered a compelling argument that from a possible lack of correlation between vividness and behavioral accuracy (for instance in memory), it is not possible to refute the correspondence between vividness measures and actual experienced vividness. The accuracy of the vividness measures may still be valid even if there is no correspondence between behavioral accuracy and experienced vividness. Our study contributes to this specific argument in showing that, empirically, brain activity measures correspond closely to vividness measures, and to a lesser degree to cognitive and behavioral measures. Consequently, matters appear to be a bit more complex: it is not so much about the absence of correspondence, since across many experiments all the terms in the set of relationships are to some extent reciprocally correlated. It is about the strength of the correlations, i.e., empirically what matters is the degree of precision (reliability) for which some relationships stand out more than others. \n\n\n## Vividness and Consciousness: Theoretical Underpinnings of Validity \n  \nFinally, we would like to discuss some implications of a more general, less technical nature concerning how this study is situated to advance our understanding of vividness and consciousness in general. That is, in terms of the validity approach we have taken this is the next logical step: we attempt here to provide a full blown (albeit concise) theory of the structure of the attribute which the term vividness refers to. \n\nThe present study is compatible with a tenet that is widely held in some current neurobiological theories of consciousness. In brief, that sensory-affective (not exclusively\/necessarily visual) mental images, defined as objective \u201cisomorphic neural maps\u201d associated with external and inner (somatic) environmental input, can constitute the first-order basic building block of consciousness during both perception and memory of perception [for review see  ]. Within this broader theoretical framework, a corollary that can be added through this study is that vividness expresses the graded isomorphic aspect of the conscious experience that more or less directly and immediately arises from the brain\u2019s complex processing of sensory-affective information in perception and memory. That is, vividness could be conceived as a particular isomorphism or equivalence mapping function ( ) that goes beyond the \u201cturned on\u201d consciousness state; as it expresses changes and states of inner experience in terms of equivalent graded levels of knowledge. In this context, vividness may have the role of making explicit the level or strength of the isomorphic correspondence between the inner first-person experience of the input and the environmental input itself ( ). In other words, measurements of vividness, notably through VR, reflect the gradient of immediate conscious experience of images that mirror isomorphic objective neural processes during perception and memory. Thus, vividness can be considered a chief phenomenological feature of primary sensory consciousness, and it supports the idea that consciousness is a graded phenomenon. \n\nThe concept of vividness however can be extended to a number of other types of consciousness. Isomorphic maps may develop into and become embedded in more complex and dynamic neurofunctional structures [\u2018nested neural hierarchies\u2019  ; \u201cactivity cycles\u201d ( )] that include emotions, plans, goals and actions, etc., which are removed from immediate environmental inputs or memory of them, in other words, states of consciousness other than those associated with perception and memory. These states may involve derivative \u201csecond-order\u201d isomorphic correspondences ( ) whose organization is not in forms of maps, but complex multidimensional patterns [e.g. the computational conceptual structures described by  ]. In this other context, vividness may be recycled to express graded knowledge of conscious experience that may or may not be linked with any first-order isomorphic representations, and it may or may not recycle sensory-affective isomorphic maps in memory. In these cases, vividness may express conscious knowledge even though it is not necessarily experienced in the form of mental images. Hence, vividness may have also an important role in accounting for phenomenal conscious processes associated with mental simulation ( ), analogical reasoning ( ), and strategies and metacognition ( ). As suggested by our findings, VVIQ may be a particularly sensitive measure of vividness when the latter cases involve imagery. However, other subjective or indirect computational measures could be devised to indicate how vividness captures other aspects of conscious knowledge which do not involve or require mental images at all ( ). Indeed, as mentioned in the introduction, we believe one of the most promising potential future contributions of the construct of vividness may be allowing a constructive integration of the roles of emotions, motives and goals within neurocognitive and epigenetic theories of imagery and consciousness. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAlthough the first attempt to validate the vividness construct through meta-analysis can be attributed to  , his detailed and systematic study was limited to the VVIQ. The VVIQ became the most widely used, standard tool by which vividness, and imagery self-reports are studied ( ), but this conclusion may be predicated on an erroneous assumption. The present analysis suggests the study of vividness, and researcher conceptualization of it more generally, needs to be reconsidered. In addition, it suggests that the construct of vividness may be most thoroughly studied using neuroscience methodologies that do not necessarily have observable behavioural outputs, such that phenomenological self-reports may be reliably and validly associated with neural correlates on a trial-by-trial basis. Capitalizing on the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of its validity, the concept of vividness can explain key aspects of the phenomenological experience of mental imagery, but it can be applied beyond, extending to other forms of conscious awareness, which do not necessarily involve imagery. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":6007154,"text_md5":"79437b48cd23a4d5a48a05c8b5c22e27","field_positions":{"authors":[0,60],"journal":[61,79],"publication_year":[81,85],"title":[96,245],"keywords":[259,341],"abstract":[354,2265],"body":[2274,64598]},"batch":2,"pmid":30042840,"doi":"10.1093\/nc\/nix006","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6007154","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6007154"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6007154\">6007154<\/a>","list_title":"PMC6007154  Meta-analytic comparison of trial- versus questionnaire-based vividness reportability across behavioral, cognitive and neural measurements of imagery"}

To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nDecision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon that is important and commonly used in everyday life situations. Because older people are at increased risk of developing severe pathologies that impact their functional independence, they have to face more decision-making situations [ ]. These decisions concern, for example, consent to a specific treatment. However, it can also involve complex choices, such as moving from their home to a facility better adapted to their health condition. This type of decision making is a dynamic process that involves a balance between risk-taking, the preservation of independence and safety. However, through accumulated experience, older people also have the ability to use a range of experiences to support their decision making [ , , ]. \n\nDecision making refers to a process that includes several steps, from analyzing a problem, to taking action to solve it. In the medical field, the ability to make a decision relies on the ability to provide informed consent [ , , ]. Decision making has been broken down into three cognitive stages: (i) option generation, (ii) option evaluation, and (iii) launching the action [ , ]. In addition to mobilizing the sensory functions necessary for communication and language skills involved in the integration of information, decision making involves complex neuropsychological processes. Indeed, decision making is largely part of executive functioning and involves other processes such as flexibility, inhibition, working memory and emotion recognition. \n\nNeuropsychological tests that assess risky decision making typically use two types of conditions: (1) decisions \u201cunder ambiguity\u201d, where the probability associated with each outcome is unknown, and (2) decisions \u201cunder risk\u201d, where the rule of attribution and occurrence of an event is known [ ]. Risk preferences often differ depending on whether people make choices based on described probabilities, versus direct experience of the odds and outcomes in behavioral tasks [ ]. In decisions based on experience, which are closest to the real-life decision, the most frequently used behavioral test is the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which is generally recognized as a decision-under-ambiguity task [ ]. Other related behavioral tests include the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) [ ] and the Game of Dice Task (GDT) [ ]. Computerized versions of those behavioral tasks have been adapted and are widely used in the literature. Nevertheless, the classification allowing the distinction between \u201cunder ambiguity\u201d and \u201cunder risk\u201d is based on the main period of interest analyzed. Indeed, in the IGT and BART, the principle is that there are classically two phases in these tasks, associated with a learning curve. Initially, the participant explores strategies corresponding to \u201cunder-ambiguity\u201d experimentation. In a second phase, the participant has understood which strategies are advantageous or not, switching to a model called \u201cunder-risk\u201d. However, the BART involves much more risk taking and impulsivity. Indeed, the participant has direct feedback on his\/her strategy (explosion or gain) and can adapt his\/her risk-taking accordingly for the following trials [ ]. However, in the IGT, the participant tries to understand the winning strategy, which is not explicit [ ]. In the GDT, on the other hand, the consequences of choices are explicitly given in advance. Consequently, the GDT is an exclusive decision-making task under risk, without learning by feedback. These tests have been used in numerous studies in both healthy young and older populations, as well as in clinical populations (with psychiatric disorders, in particular) [ , , ]. These studies have shown qualitative and quantitative differences in behavioral strategies in these tasks as a function of age, the presence of neurological lesions and\/or neuropsychiatric pathologies. \n\nThere is evidence that decision-making processes can be affected over the course of normal aging, especially when decisions must be taken quickly, and that this may be due to an underlying decline in processing speed [ , ]. A decline in executive functioning in aging such as increased perseverative behavior may also be associated with risky decision-making impairment. Thus, when faced with new and unfamiliar situations, older adults take more time to analyze the situation than younger ones. This has been observed during decision-making tests in situations where the outcomes and consequences are unknown, such as the first phase of the IGT or BART [ ]. On the other hand, in a previous meta-analysis, it was noted that, in behaviorally risky decision-making tasks, the need for learning had an impact on the choice strategy in aging compared to younger subjects [ ]. As soon as the rules become clear, i.e., in the \u201cunder-risk\u201d final phases of behavioral tasks, however, this difference between younger and older healthy adults disappears. Thus, when older adults are given enough time or when they can rely on past experiences, decision-making function remains preserved pp. 351\u2013370 in [ , ]. Furthermore, the decision-making processes involved in these tests include executive functions, but also motivation and reward processes. In general, tests tend to show that aging is associated with a change in strategy; a reduction or prevention of losses is favored over the optimization of gains. Choices resulting from this shift are influenced by the individual motivation profile in each situation. These data are also found in ecological and neuro-economic analyses [ ]. \n\nThe development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. However, studies on decision making have been carried out mainly in healthy young adults. In this specific population, several meta-analyses have been performed [ , , ]. Results have mainly shown activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) [ ], especially in sub-risk decision-making situations (which are most similar to complex real-life decision-making situations), followed by the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the insula [ ]. In recent years, studies comparing young versus older healthy participants have shown inconsistent results in terms of patterns of activation, which may depend on the types of tasks used. As such, healthy older subjects are reported to have greater contralateral activation in prefrontal and insular regions compared to young adults [ , ], while other authors have described an age-related increase in right ventro-medial prefrontal cortex activity [ , ]. Nevertheless, although the use of neuroimaging techniques to study decision-making abilities associated with aging is growing rapidly, there are many fewer studies with this population than with younger adults, and the results are still sometimes ambiguous and difficult to interpret. \n\nThus, it seemed important at this stage to determine, based on these data, if there was a common pattern of functional activation related to experience-based decision making in risky situations in normal aging emerging from these studies. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThis meta-analysis was conducted following the guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ ]. The details of the method are explained below: \n\n### 2.1. Criteria for Inclusion \n  \nParticipants: We included only studies that included healthy older participants. To target an aging population, and to ensure that we did not miss any relevant studies, we included studies with a minimal inclusion age of 55 years. This is typically the minimum age for the inclusion of older participants. \n\nfMRI: Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow, which creates what is referred to as a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Thus, Voxel-Based Morphometry analyses in anatomical MRI were not considered. Diffusion and resting state data were also not included. \n\nDecision-making tasks in risky situations: This corresponds to both \u201csub-ambiguity\u201d and \u201cunder risk\u201d behavioral tasks, as well as mixed decision-making neuropsychological tests. As such, we narrowed our inclusions to widely used and replicated tasks such as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and the Iowa Gambling task (IGT). \n\n\n### 2.2. Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched for publications specifically evaluating decision making in older adults. Databases of peer-reviewed literature were systematically searched on PubMed and EMBASE for manuscripts in the English language published up to December 2020. \n\nThe primary search term was as follows: (aged or older or elder or elderly or geriatrics or senior or adults or adult) AND (fMRI or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfunctional neuroimaging\u201d or \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d) AND (\u201cDecision-making\u201d or \u201cDecision making\u201d) AND (\u201cIowa Gambling Task\u201d OR IGT or \u201cGame of Dice Task\u201d or GDT OR \u201cBalloon Analogue Risk task\u201d OR BART). \n\nThis search yielded 620 articles. The titles and abstracts were reviewed to refine the number of potentially relevant articles. All the articles in which the abstract did not specifically mention the age of the participants, or the nature of neuropsychological tests (risk-based decision-making test), were fully reviewed. Following this step, the inclusion criteria were assessed for each study by carefully reading the Methods and Results sections of each article. \n\nAs a final step, if an article met the search criteria, at this stage, all the references were examined one by one by the authors and the articles were screened using \u201cConnectedpaper.com\u201d algorithms, to make sure that no study had been omitted. \n\nWithin the selected articles, the data extracted included the age of the subjects, level of education, global cognitive assessment, type of decision-making test and coordinates of hyperactivation peaks in the decision-making phase. Among the data analyzed in fMRI, as we were interested in the decision-making phase and not reward-based neurological processes, data associated with reward times were excluded. \n\n\n### 2.3. Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll the studies included in the systematic review were also assessed for a meta-analysis after a quality check with the Covidence Quality Assessment Template. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to report (i) specific peaks of foci of activation in either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and (ii) peak activation coordinates of whole-brain analyses (could not employ only region of interest, ROI, analyses). \n\nTo perform quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm [ , ] which treats foci as 3-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions centered at the given coordinates. \n\nBased on these recommendations, to correct for multiple comparisons, a cluster-level family-wise error (cFWE) at   p   < 0.05 was applied using uncorrected   p   < 0.001 at the voxel level as the cluster-forming threshold (based on 1000 permutations). \n\nTo perform ALE meta-analysis, we used specialized software (GingerALE v.3.2.0) to combine the activation coordinates from several studies [ ]. All the peak voxel coordinates were reported in MNI space. For consistency, peak voxels reported in Talairach space in primary studies were converted into MNI space, and the ALE results were displayed onto the MNI brain template using the Mango software package. \n\nThe performance of a meta-analysis requires some vigilance in the case of small numbers of included studies [ ]. In our study, we distinguish significant results as clusters from non-significant peaks. To avoid biases, only cluster results will be detailed and discussed. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nA total of 620 references were selected for initial screening, and, among them, 136 duplicates were removed. As such, the titles and abstracts of 484 studies were screened. After this first screening, 60 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility. Finally, after careful analyses, 55 studies were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: 37 were excluded for \u201cnon-target population\u201d (subjects younger than our criteria), 15 for non-target study design (no risky decision-making tests) and three for non-target outcome (ROI analysis and connectivity). As a result, only five studies fully satisfied all the criteria including passing quality checking and were included for meta-analysis [ , , , , ]. A flow chart is shown in  . \n\nThese five studies included a total of 98 healthy subjects aged from 58 to 95, with a mean age 69.5 years, and were cognitively normal. The behavioral tests used were the BART in one publication, the GDT in one other and the IGT in the three remaining studies. All the study characteristics and behavioral results are summarized in  . Some studies included only healthy older adults, another compared healthy and Parkinson Disease older adults and another compared younger and older adults. The five studies came from different teams. \n\nConcerning the paradigms used, for GDT, Labbuda and al. [ ] used an adapted paradigm with no feedback phase. For the BART task, Yu et al. [ ] used a two-level adaptation of the Lejuez paradigm [ ], with low and high risk using two different colors, but without explaining it to participants. Concerning the three IGT studies included, they are all based on the Bechara initial task adapted by Li for fMRI sessions [ ]. As such, the three paradigms are quite similar, with a four-choice situation. Halfmann and al. [ ] reduced the number of trials to 80. \n\nConcerning the fMRI analysis, only based on the decision phase, our systematic review yielded 22 foci to be analyzed from the 98 participants. \n\n\n### 3.2. Main Clusters \n  \nThe meta-analysis yielded two clusters, with four peaks in the first cluster and two peaks in the second one. The full results are detailed in   and  A,B. \n\nThe first cluster is 16.752 mm , from (12, 0, \u221216) to (58, 42, 34), centered at (38.4, 21.4, 5.3) with four peaks and a max value of 0.0079 ALE, 1.8139492 \u00d7 10  P, 3.57 Z at (38, 20, \u22123). It is located in the right brain hemisphere, with 76.3% sub-lobar activation and 23.7% Frontal Lobe activation. Anatomically, this corresponds to the Lentiform Nucleus (49%), the Insula (17.4%), the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (11.4%), the Middle Frontal Gyrus (10.1%), the Claustrum (4.8%), the Caudate (3.5%) and the Precentral Gyrus (2.6%). In terms of functional areas, these are mainly the Putamen (38.8%), Brodmann area 13 (17.1%), Brodmann area 9 (9.2%), the Lateral Globus Pallidus (8.8%), Brodmann area 47 (5.4%), the Caudate Head (3.5%), Brodmann area 45 (3.5%), Brodmann area 46 (2.5%), Brodmann area 44 (2.1%) and the Medial Globus Pallidus (1.4%). \n\nThis corresponds to activations of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and cortico-basal loops of the motivation and reward circuits including the insula and putamen. \n\nThe second cluster is 11.048 mm , from (\u221244, 10, \u221224) to (\u221214, 48, 8), centered at (\u221227.6, 30.1, \u22129.4) with two peaks and a max value of 0.0114 ALE, 4.2548763 \u00d7 10  P, 4.45 Z at (\u221222, 34, \u221214). It is located in the left-brain hemisphere with 55% sub-lobar activation and 45% Frontal Lobe activation. Anatomically, this corresponds to the Insula (36.7%), the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (30.6%), the Claustrum (15.8%), the Middle Frontal Gyrus (14%) and Extra-Nuclear (1.8%). In terms of functional areas, these are mainly Brodmann area 13 (33.8%), Brodmann area 47 (25.5%), Brodmann area 11 (12.6%) and Brodmann area 45 (5.8%). \n\nThis corresponds to activations of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the left dlPFC and cortico-basal loops of the motivation and reward circuits. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nOur meta-analysis of patterns of neural activation during behavioral risky decision making in healthy older adults showed clusters of activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as in cortico-basal loops. Despite an inclusion criterion >55 years old, the mean age of the study population was 69.5 years with few participants from 55 to 60 and many participants older than 60, up to 95 years old Thus, our study concerned older participants. \n\nThe results of the current meta-analysis are in line with previous findings showing involvement of both dlPFC and cortico-basal loops to support executive functioning and cognitive automatization, as well as involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex and the insulae to support emotion and reward loops. In this regard, these findings are similar to what has been reported in younger healthy adults [ ]. \n\nIndeed, the insula is involved in emotional regulation circuits, particularly in relation to reward circuits and disgust. The activation of the insula could be associated with reduced risk taking and with more conservative behavior, potentially associated with risk avoidance [ ]. \n\nConcerning the inferior frontal gyrus, recent studies have highlighted its importance in working memory and cognitive flexibility in decision making [ ].  \n\nIn our meta-analysis, these activations were found in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, although predominantly in the left hemisphere, classically known for its involvement in the modulation of decision making in reaction to the identification of emotional processes with projections within the insula [ ]. In addition, bilateral activation (although predominantly right) was found in the putamen and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, associated with executive functions, cognitive automatization and the planning of the response in relation to the decision taken [ ]. \n\nIn contrast to young adults, however, results of the current meta-analysis indicate that older adults show a different pattern of functional activation in several regions. In fact, we observed a bilateral, although predominantly right, pattern of activation of the cortico-basal loops. Although our study population does not allow direct comparison with younger subjects, the literature shows that this pattern of activation seems to be predominantly left-sided in young subjects [ ]. \n\nVarious functional neuroimaging studies in cognitive aging have led to the development of models, such as the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) [ , ] and the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA) theory, trying to explain these modifications seen in aging [ ]. The HAROLD model predicts that aging is associated with the recruitment of additional neural resources in regions contralateral to those seen in younger people in the prefrontal cortex [ , ]. Even though ROI structural imaging studies on risky decision making in aging seem to support the HAROLD model [ ], we were unable to find evidence to confirm any of those models in our meta-analysis. Indeed, the results of the current meta-analysis rather seem to support the view that the pattern of functional activation is contralateral to that found in young adults, rather than bilateral, at least with respect to decision making. \n\nThe set of behavioral tasks included in our meta-analysis are risk-taking decision-making tasks. However, among the five included studies, four used tasks combining decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk, while the fifth task required only decisions under risk. Although all of these tasks mobilize executive functions, we must remain careful in not over-interpreting the results of our meta-analysis, since the tasks used cognitive processes to varying degrees, namely, impulsivity, learning by feedback and risk taking. This limits the generalizability of our results and warrants the need for further studies on complex decision making to be carried out, especially within the context of aging. \n\nThus, this question of compensation in aging with possible recruitment of additional areas still remains partially unexplained in decision making. In this respect, our meta-analysis is not powerful enough and other studies need to be conducted to be able to better analyze this type of compensation. Although our study was limited in its statistical power, it approached this question in an original way and synthesized the current known data. To be able to really interpret the neurofunctional activation data, a greater homogeneity of the paradigms and protocols of decision-making tasks and fMRI analysis must be sought. Although the paradigms included in our study are not identical, the behavioral approach to risky decision making is similar enough across tasks to warrant analysis. However, paradigm adaptations to age-related vulnerabilities, including simplifications of tasks, are observed, sometimes deviating considerably from the initial behavioral task. On the other hand, the same acquisition, analyzed by several teams, can lead to divergent results [ ]. This necessitates a quality process for future research. Given the lack of standardization, we chose to restrict our meta-analysis to widely used tasks that have been the subject of behavioral analyses reproduced in the literature, to avoid biases related to tasks that would not respect risky decision-making behaviors. This leads our analysis to focus on a small number of studies but favors the comparability of the studies and thus the relevance of the results. It is widely accepted that the more the studies included in a meta-analysis, the better the usability of the results [ ]. However, because of the narrowness of our inclusion criteria and the exploitation of only the results grouped in the form of clusters, without integrating the isolated peaks, we reduced the risk of bias [ ]. We therefore present our results as a minimum activation pattern. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by further studies as the functional research on decision making in older adults grows. \n\nThus, our meta-analysis describes a model of activation in the left OFC, bilateral dlPFC and right insula that can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making behavioral tasks of healthy older subjects. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis on the neural correlates of risky decision making in normal aging highlights the involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation (insula, inferior frontal gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex) and executive function (Putamen and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).  \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":8393360,"text_md5":"1f97f67e88574e30ecb6da59e24eec97","field_positions":{"authors":[0,87],"journal":[88,97],"publication_year":[99,103],"title":[114,216],"keywords":[230,271],"abstract":[284,1841],"body":[1850,24653]},"batch":2,"pmid":34439662,"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci11081043","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8393360","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8393360"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8393360\">8393360<\/a>","list_title":"PMC8393360  Neural Activation in Risky Decision-Making Tasks in Healthy Older Adults: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Data"}

Medications have been introduced to alleviate the craving or reduce the appetite via a neuropharmacological approach. However, the underlying cerebral processing of the medications was largely unknown. This study aimed to meta-analyze existing neuroimaging findings. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify relevant publications. Original studies that reported brain imaging findings using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were initially included. The reported coordinates of brain activation available from the studies were extracted and meta-analyzed with the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach via the software GingerALE. The overall analysis pooling data from 24 studies showed that the right claustrum and insula were the targeted sites of altered cerebral processing of food cues by the medications. Subgroup analysis pooling data from 11 studies showed that these sites had reduced activity levels under medications compared to placebo. The location of this significant cluster partially overlapped with that attributable to affective value processing of food cues in a prior meta-analysis. No brain regions were found to have increased activity levels by medications. These neural correlates may help explain the physiological effect of food consumption by anti-appetite and anti-obesity medications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nExcessive food consumption could lead to unwanted health consequences such as weight gain and diabetes. The prevalence of obesity was reported to be around 4 - 36.5% in Europe [ ] and 28.5-32.2% in the United States [ ]. Meanwhile, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 8.8% [ ]. One way to reduce appetite or manage obesity is through pharmacological means. A recent meta-analysis showed that common anti-appetite medications, such as orlistat, phentermine plus topiramate, lorcaserin, naltrexone plus bupropion, and liraglutide could all significantly reduce body weight compared to placebo [ ]. \n\nWith the advancement of neuroimaging methods, the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of appetite and food perception has become popular. With the accumulated literature, a meta-analysis could pool data across relevant papers to identify brain regions that were consistently reported to be affected by anti-appetite medications. Such a meta-analysis could be performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, which used a probability distribution model [ ,  ] to determine the consistency of activated brain regions reported across multiple experiments. This approach successfully meta-analyzed neuroimaging studies on taste and food stimuli among healthy subjects receiving no pharmacological interventions [ - ]. However, it was largely unknown if the medications exhibited a common pattern in reducing the brain activity level in response to food stimuli that might reflect suppression of appetite or food craving. The aim of this work was to meta-analyze the existing neuroimaging results from pharmacological fMRI studies to reveal which brain regions were commonly targeted by the medications and if these brain regions exhibited a heightened or dampened response to food stimuli. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature Search and Screening \n  \nAdhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, papers were searched in multiple databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, in May 2021. The following string was used to search for the titles, abstracts, and keywords of papers: (fMRI OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d)   AND   (food* OR appetit* OR eat*)   AND   (pharmacol* OR drug* OR medicat* OR treat*). Reference lists of relevant publications were also searched to identify missed papers. \n\nThe search initially yielded 1490 papers. After excluding duplicates, 890 remained. Among them, 866 were excluded after further screening because of being irrelevant, not written in English, no task-related fMRI activation, no coordinates provided, being a single case study, duplicate samples, no significant results, and no results from the whole-brain analysis. Finally, 24 studies remained (Fig.    ). \n\n\n### Information Recorded from the Analyzed Papers \n  \nSeveral items were recorded for each of the analyzed papers, such as subject number, female ratio, subject type (healthy or with specific health issues), medication and control used, administration method, dose, fasting time before the scan, type of food cue, and whether medicated or control condition had larger brain activation (Table    ). \n\n\n### ALE Meta-analysis \n  \nThe ALE method is the commonest approach of coordinate-based meta-analysis that pools neuroimaging data from multiple studies to identify brain regions with consistent activation based on probability distribution modeling [ ]. The standard coordinates of reported brain areas with activation were pooled. Lancaster transform was deployed to convert coordinates reported in the Talairach system to the MNI system [ ]. The software GingerALE 3.0.2 (freely available from  ) was used to perform the ALE meta-analysis, with the following default parameter settings. Subject-based full-width half-maximum values were applied [ ]. The more conservative mask instead of the dilated mask was used. A cluster of brain voxels was considered significantly activated if it survived a cluster   P   < 0.05 (corrected by familywise error rate, FWE-corrected) with a primary cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.001. This threshold followed the latest recommendations to balance between false positive and false negative [ - ]. Three main analyses were performed: an overall analysis involving all data, and one analysis for [medication > control] and [medication < control] each, respectively. As there were multiple (three) studies reporting [oxytocin > control] results, an exploratory analysis was performed based on this contrast. The thresholded ALE maps were overlaid onto the Colin brain template in MNI space [ ] and visualized with Mango 4.0 (freely available from  ) to show results. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Study Characteristics \n  \nThere were 24 papers entering the meta-analysis, published between 2010 and 2020. The number of participants per study ranged from 8 to 48. Five studies recruited an equal ratio of males and females, whereas six studies recruited females only, and four studies recruited males only (Table    ) [ - ]. Twelve studies recruited healthy subjects only, and numerous studies recruiting subjects with overweight\/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Many medications were investigated, but only oxytocin was investigated in multiple (three) studies. Naltrexone was also involved in three studies, one of which was administered together with buproprion. Overnight or 12 hours of fasting before a scan seemed to be the commonest practice. Besides, 17 studies used visual food cues only. Two studies used taste food cues only, four studies used both visual and taste food cues, and one study used odor. \n\n\n### Overall Meta-analysis \n  \nThere was one significant cluster covering the claustrum and insula on the right hemisphere (Fig.    , Table    ). Seven studies (with no recurring medication shared) contributed to this cluster, four of them had [medication > control] [ ,  - ] and three had [medication < control] [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Medication > Control \n  \nThere was no significant result from pooled data from 15 studies for [medication > control]. The same was observed for pooled data from 3 studies for [oxytocin > control]. \n\n\n### Medication < Control \n  \nPooling data from 11 studies showed that there was one significant cluster covering the claustrum and insula on the right hemisphere (Fig.    , Table    ). Three studies contributed to this cluster, and they investigated citalopram, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, and exenatide, respectively [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis is the first meta-analysis of fMRI studies reporting the effects of medications on food\/taste processing in the brain. Overall results showed that the right claustrum and insula were involved by the effect of medications. Results further showed that medications caused reduced brain responses than placebo in the right claustrum and insula, whereas no significant result was found   vice versa  . \n\nTaste processing and eating behavior are complex psychophysiological issues with multiple dimensions. In particular, the five senses of visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, tactile, or any combinations of them could be stimulated. Prior meta-analysis showed that visual food cues activated the posterior brain regions responsible for visual processing, including the occipital and cerebellar structures, whereas gustatory and olfactory food cues activated the anterior brain regions responsible for visceral sensations [ ]. Most of the analyzed studies here recruited visual food cues only, implying that the reduced brain activation by medications could perhaps be cautiously interpreted as a suppressed brain activity in response to viewing food, food anticipation, or even imaging food consumption, but not the actual consumption of food. In fact, food appreciation could involve affective value, intensity, and taste quality, which could be segregated in the limbic system [ ]. The cluster found in this study was located in the ventral insula, a region relevant to taste processing [ ]. It also slightly overlapped with a cluster for affective value but did not overlap with the clusters for intensity and taste quality [ ]. \n\nAnother issue that should be noticed but not addressed in the analyzed studies was the potential influence of sex-related factors on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. For example, the commonly used naltrexone\/bupropion combination might have sex differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response, and that oestrogen might potentiate the liver metabolism of bupropion to its active metabolite form [ ]. The analyzed studies did not provide direct between-sex comparison results. They also did not accumulate a large number of uni-sex results for conducting a male   vs  . female meta-analysis. Therefore, any sex differences in the neural correlates of medication-mediated food processing remained to be elucidated. \n\nThere were several limitations of this meta-analysis. First, several studies recruited few subjects that might hinder the study power by themselves. Also, the studies were not always sex-matched, implying that some results reported from the original studies might not be generalized to the other sex. The heterogeneous sample also implied limitations in the generalization of the results. The authors of studies not reporting coordinates were not contacted to see if they could provide data. Many medications were investigated in one or two studies reporting whole-brain analysis results; therefore, it was not possible to perform medication-specific analysis for them. One study [ ] investigated rimonabant, a drug introduced in Europe in 2006 and subsequently withdrawn in 2009 due to the potential of serious psychiatric disorders [ ]. Meanwhile, ALE meta-analysis computes the consistency of brain locations involved across studies but not the effect size [ ]. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWithin the limitations of this meta-analysis, it was concluded that medications could suppress brain activation in the right claustrum and insula in response to food cues (mostly visual) compared to control\/placebo. The involved brain region partly overlapped with an activated cluster attributed to affective value evaluation of food in a prior meta-analysis. These neural correlates may help explain the physiological effect of food consumption by anti-appetite and anti-obesity medications and may be the target sites of future drug development. \n\n \n","metadata":{"pmcid":9185797,"text_md5":"a40c41da6e657ae826f5e2c9c6f50447","field_positions":{"authors":[0,19],"journal":[20,39],"publication_year":[41,45],"title":[56,125],"keywords":[139,204],"abstract":[217,1664],"body":[1673,12218]},"batch":2,"pmid":34521327,"doi":"10.2174\/1570159X19666210914142227","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9185797","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9185797"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9185797\">9185797<\/a>","list_title":"PMC9185797  Neural Correlates of Anti-appetite Medications: An fMRI Meta-analysis"}

NEURAL CORRELATES OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN PSYCHOSIS RISK AND ONSET \u2013 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FMRI STUDIES\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nBehavioural findings suggest that the emotion processing abnormalities typically observed in established schizophrenia are already present in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Evidence has been less consistent in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRp). While several studies have reported unaltered behavioural performance on emotion identification in people at CHRp compared to healthy controls, some studies have shown poorer negative emotion recognition. A growing number of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies have investigated brain response to emotion processing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes in FEP patients and CHRp individuals. Despite the marked expansion of this field over the last two decades, to date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has attempted to synthesise the evidence on the neural bases of emotion processing in these groups as potential markers of psychosis vulnerability and expression. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched for published English-language articles applying an emotion processing task during fMRI in a FEP and\/or a CHRp sample compared to healthy controls. References of included papers were also screened. For CHRp studies, only those including participants by the basic or attenuated symptom presentation criteria were included. \n\nIndividual study methodology and results were extracted and systematically reviewed. In addition, at present, statistical parametric mapping contrast maps (\u2018T-maps\u2019) are being collected from study authors and will be meta-analysed using the Seed-based d Mapping method. The contrasts meta-analysed will be the ones most commonly reported in the studies identified, i.e., of all emotion over comparison conditions and of negative emotion over neutral conditions. These will be meta-analysed separately, as behavioural evidence suggests that emotion recognition performance in these populations might be valence specific. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor the systematic review, 4,389 papers were identified through the search. 19 relevant fMRI papers were identified and their references were screened. 17 articles were included after full-text screening. Six out of twelve fMRI studies in the FEP population reported lower brain activation to emotion processing tasks compared to healthy controls. Four articles reported region-specific hyper- and hypoactivations and two studies found no significant difference. Of the seven studies in the CHRp population, one study reported lower brain response to emotion relative to healthy controls, two studies found hyperactivations, one study found region-specific increases and decreases, and two studies reported no significant difference. The most consistent finding across studies was lower amygdala activation in FEP participants (n=6). Conversely, in the CHRp population one article found an increase in amygdala response to emotion with age, consistently with one other article but contrasting with another study showing activity decreases in this region. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, no previous systematic review or meta-analysis has synthesised the fMRI findings of emotion processing in both people at CHRp and a FEP. The present systematic review shows that while more consistent hypoactivations are found in the FEP population, results are less consistent in CHRp studies. The undergoing meta-analysis will quantitatively synthesise these findings. Elucidating the nature of emotion processing aberrances in early psychosis may help understand the functional changes across both vulnerability and symptom emergence phases and inform molecular investigations into its underlying mechanisms. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n","metadata":{"pmcid":7234314,"text_md5":"ed56904dd34dadcb3c81bdbb4bb536a8","field_positions":{"authors":[0,79],"journal":[80,94],"publication_year":[96,100],"title":[111,242],"keywords":[256,256],"abstract":[269,4007],"body":[4016,4016]},"batch":2,"doi":"10.1093\/schbul\/sbaa029.693","pmc_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7234314","efetch_url":"https:\/\/eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234314"},"display_title":"pmcid: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7234314\">7234314<\/a>","list_title":"PMC7234314  T133.
