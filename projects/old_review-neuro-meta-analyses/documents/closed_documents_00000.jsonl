However, the differences in brain activity between grip type (i.e. power or precision) and pattern (i.e. dynamic or static) are not fully understood. In order to address this, we performed Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis between grip type and grip pattern using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. ALE provides a probabilistic summary of the BOLD response in hundreds of subjects, which is often beyond the scope of a single fMRI experiment. We collected data from 28 functional magnetic resonance data sets, which included a total of 398 male and female subjects. Using ALE, we analyzed the BOLD response during power, precision, static and dynamic grip in a range of forces and age in right handed healthy individuals without physical impairment, cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction using a variety of grip tools, feedback and experimental training. Power grip generates unique activation in the postcentral gyrus (areas 1 and 3b) and precision grip generates unique activation in the supplementary motor area (SMA, area 6) and precentral gyrus (area 4a). Dynamic handgrip generates unique activation in the precentral gyrus (area 4p) and SMA (area 6) and of particular interest, both dynamic and static grip share activation in the area 2 of the postcentral gyrus, an area implicated in the evolution of handgrip. According to effect size analysis, precision and dynamic grip generates stronger activity than power and static, respectively. Our study demonstrates specific differences between grip type and pattern. However, there was a large degree of overlap in the pre and postcentral gyrus, SMA and areas of the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network, which indicates that other mechanisms are potentially involved in regulating handgrip.

Dynamic handgrip generates unique activation in the precentral gyrus (area 4p) and SMA (area 6) and of particular interest, both dynamic and static grip share activation in the area 2 of the postcentral gyrus, an area implicated in the evolution of handgrip. According to effect size analysis, precision and dynamic grip generates stronger activity than power and static, respectively. Our study demonstrates specific differences between grip type and pattern. However, there was a large degree of overlap in the pre and postcentral gyrus, SMA and areas of the frontal-parietal-cerebellar network, which indicates that other mechanisms are potentially involved in regulating handgrip. Further, our study provides empirically based regions of interest, which can be downloaded here within, that can be used to more effectively study power grip in a range of populations and conditions. \", \"authors\": \"King, M and Rauch, H G and Stein, D J and Brooks, S J\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/24927986\">24927986<\/a>","list_title":"PMID24927986 The handyman's brain: a neuroimaging meta-analysis describing the similarities and differences between grip type and pattern in humans."}

Functional activation of brain regions are thought to be reflected by increases in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in PET studies, and in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI. rCBF increases to noxious stimuli are almost constantly observed in second somatic (SII) and insular regions, and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and with slightly less consistency in the contralateral thalamus and the primary somatic area (SI). Activation of the lateral thalamus, SI, SII and insula are thought to be related to the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain processing. SI is activated in roughly half of the studies, and the probability of obtaining SI activation appears related to the total amount of body surface stimulated (spatial summation) and probably also by temporal summation and attention to the stimulus. In a number of studies, the thalamic response was bilateral, probably reflecting generalised arousal in reaction to pain. ACC does not seem to be involved in coding stimulus intensity or location but appears to participate in both the affective and attentional concomitants of pain sensation, as well as in response selection. ACC subdivisions activated by painful stimuli partially overlap those activated in orienting and target detection tasks, but are distinct from those activated in tests involving sustained attention (Stroop, etc.). In addition to ACC, increased blood flow in the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices is thought to reflect attentional and memory networks activated by noxious stimulation. Less noted but frequent activation concerns motor-related areas such as the striatum, cerebellum and supplementary motor area, as well as regions involved in pain control such as the periaqueductal grey. In patients, chronic spontaneous pain is associated with decreased resting rCBF in contralateral thalamus, which may be reverted by analgesic procedures. Abnormal pain evoked by innocuous stimuli (allodynia) has been associated with amplification of the thalamic, insular and SII responses, concomitant to a paradoxical CBF decrease in ACC. It is argued that imaging studies of allodynia should be encouraged in order to understand central reorganisations leading to abnormal cortical pain processing. A number of brain areas activated by acute pain, particularly the thalamus and anterior cingulate, also show increases in rCBF during analgesic procedures. Taken together, these data suggest that hemodynamic responses to pain reflect simultaneously the sensory, cognitive and affective dimensions of pain, and that the same structure may both respond to pain and participate in pain control.

Contemporary accounts have suggested, instead, that recovery might be supported by under-utilised areas of the premorbid language network, which are downregulated in health to save neural resources ('variable neurodisplacement'). Despite the importance of understanding the neural bases of language recovery clinically and theoretically, there is no consensus as to which specific regions are more likely to be activated in post-stroke aphasia (PSA) than healthy individuals. Accordingly, we performed an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of language functional neuroimaging studies in PSA. We obtained coordinate-based functional neuroimaging data for 481 individuals with aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke and 530 linked controls from 33 studies that met predefined inclusion criteria. ALE identified regions of consistent, above-chance spatial convergence of activation, as well as regions of significantly different activation likelihood, between participant groups and language tasks. Overall, these findings dispute the prevailing theory that aphasia recovery involves recruitment of novel right hemisphere territory into the language network post-stroke. Instead, multiple regions throughout both hemispheres were consistently activated during language tasks in both PSA and controls. Regions of the right anterior insula, frontal operculum and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis were more likely to be activated across all language tasks in PSA than controls. Similar regions were more likely to be activated during higher than lower demand comprehension or production tasks, consistent with them representing enhanced utilisation of spare capacity within right hemisphere executive-control related regions. This provides novel evidence that 'variable neurodisplacement' underlies language network changes that occur post-stroke. Conversely, multiple undamaged regions were less likely to be activated across all language tasks in PSA than controls, including domain-general regions of medial superior frontal and paracingulate cortex, right IFG pars triangularis and temporal pole. These changes might represent functional diaschisis, and demonstrate that there is not global, undifferentiated upregulation of all domain-general neural resources during language in PSA. Such knowledge is essential if we are to design neurobiologically-informed therapeutic interventions to facilitate language recovery. \n","metadata":"{\"pmid\": \"33744459\", \"journal\": \"NeuroImage\", \"publication_year\": \"2021\", \"title\": \"Language networks in aphasia and health: A 1000 participant activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis.\", \"keywords\": \"Language \\nMeta-analysis \\nPET \\nPlasticity \\nStroke \\nfMRI \\n\", \"abstract\": \"Aphasia recovery post-stroke is classically and most commonly hypothesised to rely on regions that were not involved in language premorbidly, through 'neurocomputational invasion' or engagement of 'quiescent homologues'.

We obtained coordinate-based functional neuroimaging data for 481 individuals with aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke and 530 linked controls from 33 studies that met predefined inclusion criteria. ALE identified regions of consistent, above-chance spatial convergence of activation, as well as regions of significantly different activation likelihood, between participant groups and language tasks. Overall, these findings dispute the prevailing theory that aphasia recovery involves recruitment of novel right hemisphere territory into the language network post-stroke. Instead, multiple regions throughout both hemispheres were consistently activated during language tasks in both PSA and controls. Regions of the right anterior insula, frontal operculum and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis were more likely to be activated across all language tasks in PSA than controls. Similar regions were more likely to be activated during higher than lower demand comprehension or production tasks, consistent with them representing enhanced utilisation of spare capacity within right hemisphere executive-control related regions. This provides novel evidence that 'variable neurodisplacement' underlies language network changes that occur post-stroke. Conversely, multiple undamaged regions were less likely to be activated across all language tasks in PSA than controls, including domain-general regions of medial superior frontal and paracingulate cortex, right IFG pars triangularis and temporal pole. These changes might represent functional diaschisis, and demonstrate that there is not global, undifferentiated upregulation of all domain-general neural resources during language in PSA. Such knowledge is essential if we are to design neurobiologically-informed therapeutic interventions to facilitate language recovery. \", \"authors\": \"Stefaniak, James D and Alyahya, Reem S W and Lambon Ralph, Matthew A\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33744459\">33744459<\/a>","list_title":"PMID33744459 Language networks in aphasia and health: A 1000 participant activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis."}

Longitudinal neuroimaging studies are required to examine these changes prospectively, as potential targets for brain-based treatments for ASD. \", \"authors\": \"Dickstein, Daniel P and Pescosolido, Matthew F and Reidy, Brooke L and Galvan, Thania and Kim, Kerri L and Seymour, Karen E and Laird, Angela R and Di Martino, Adriana and Barrett, Rowland P\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23452684\">23452684<\/a>","list_title":"PMID23452684 Developmental meta-analysis of the functional neural correlates of autism spectrum disorders."}

A total of 68 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders experiencing AVHs during scanning were included.

Patients experiencing AVHs demonstrated significantly increased activation likelihoods in a bilateral neural network, including the Broca's area (activation likelihood estimation=1.84\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), anterior insula (1.78\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), precentral gyrus (1.46\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), frontal operculum (1.29\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), middle and superior temporal gyri (1.59\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), inferior parietal lobule (1.33\u00d710\u207b\u00b3), and hippocampus\/parahippocampal region (1.90\u00d710\u207b\u00b3).

Future studies can build on this meta-analysis and will help to elucidate the clinically relevant therapeutic effects of acupuncture. \", \"authors\": \"Chae, Younbyoung and Chang, Dong-Seon and Lee, Soon-Ho and Jung, Won-Mo and Lee, In-Seon and Jackson, Stephen and Kong, Jian and Lee, Hyangsook and Park, Hi-Joon and Lee, Hyejung and Wallraven, Christian\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23395475\">23395475<\/a>","list_title":"PMID23395475 Inserting needles into the body: a meta-analysis of brain activity associated with acupuncture needle stimulation."}

Numerous neuroimaging studies have found that conventionality, sentential context, and task demand can influence the involvement of the RH in metaphor processing. The current meta-analysis used foci from 17 original functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to identify what factors modulate the involvement of the RH in metaphor processing. Activation likelihood estimation was used for quantification.

We conducted coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses on 26 structural MRI and 81 functional MRI investigations, including stratification by task type. We also meta-analyzed regional and global volumetric changes. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of all MRI studies combined. Reduced thalamic volume was present in both SCZ and BD RELs. Moreover, SCZ-RELs showed alterations in corticostriatal-thalamic networks, spanning the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal regions, while BD-RELs showed altered thalamocortical and limbic regions, including the ventrolateral prefrontal, superior parietal, and medial temporal cortices, with frontoparietal alterations in RELs of BD type I. Familiarity for SCZ and BD is associated with alterations in the thalamocortical circuits, which may be the expression of the shared genetic mechanism underlying both disorders. Furthermore, the involvement of different prefrontocortical and temporal nodes may be associated with a differential symptom expression in the two disorders. \", \"authors\": \"Cattarinussi, Giulia and Kubera, Katharina M and Hirjak, Dusan and Wolf, Robert C and Sambataro, Fabio\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35523593\">35523593<\/a>","list_title":"PMID35523593 Neural Correlates of the Risk for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder: A Meta-analysis of Structural and Functional Neuroimaging Studies."}

Since these studies focused on the regulated region(s), little is known about the target-independent mechanisms associated with neurofeedback-guided control of brain activation, i.e. the regulating network. While the specificity of the activation during self-regulation is an important factor, no study has effectively determined the network involved in self-regulation in general. In an effort to detect regions that are responsible for the act of brain regulation, we performed a post-hoc analysis of data involving different target regions based on studies from different research groups. We included twelve suitable studies that examined nine different target regions amounting to a total of 175 subjects and 899 neurofeedback runs. Data analysis included a standard first- (single subject, extracting main paradigm) and second-level (single subject, all runs) general linear model (GLM) analysis of all participants taking into account the individual timing. Subsequently, at the third level, a random effects model GLM included all subjects of all studies, resulting in an overall mixed effects model. Since four of the twelve studies had a reduced field of view (FoV), we repeated the same analysis in a subsample of eight studies that had a well-overlapping FoV to obtain a more global picture of self-regulation. The GLM analysis revealed that the anterior insula as well as the basal ganglia, notably the striatum, were consistently active during the regulation of brain activation across the studies. The anterior insula has been implicated in interoceptive awareness of the body and cognitive control. Basal ganglia are involved in procedural learning, visuomotor integration and other higher cognitive processes including motivation. The larger FoV analysis yielded additional activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporo-parietal area and the visual association areas including the temporo-occipital junction. In conclusion, we demonstrate that several key regions, such as the anterior insula and the basal ganglia, are consistently activated during self-regulation in real-time fMRI neurofeedback independent of the targeted region-of-interest. Our results imply that if the real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies target regions of this regulation network, such as the anterior insula, care should be given whether activation changes are related to successful regulation, or related to the regulation process per se.

Using fMRI, the MFC has been associated with diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to comprehensively map specific psychological functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies to identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine which psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2-4 smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite division within MFC, with each zone displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies.

Each individual region was recruited by multiple psychological states, suggesting subregions of medial frontal cortex are functionally heterogeneous. \", \"authors\": \"de la Vega, Alejandro and Chang, Luke J and Banich, Marie T and Wager, Tor D and Yarkoni, Tal\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27307242\">27307242<\/a>","list_title":"PMID27307242 Large-Scale Meta-Analysis of Human Medial Frontal Cortex Reveals Tripartite Functional Organization."}

Likewise, deficits in attention are a hallmark of sleep deprivation in healthy individuals. Whether ADHD and sleep deprivation modulate common, or disparate, neural systems is unknown. No study has yet utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate sleep loss in ADHD. We address this gap by performing a novel meta-analysis to compare patterns of fMRI activation during sleep deprivation and ADHD. We performed a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis using the GingerALE software.

We characterized neurocognitive effects independently associated with T2DM and age in a large cohort of human subjects from the UK Biobank with cross-sectional neuroimaging and cognitive data. We then proceeded to evaluate the extent of overlap between the effects related to T2DM and age by applying correlation measures to the separately characterized neurocognitive changes. Our findings were complemented by meta-analyses of published reports with cognitive or neuroimaging measures for T2DM and healthy controls (HCs). We also evaluated in a cohort of T2DM-diagnosed individuals using UK Biobank how disease chronicity and metformin treatment interact with the identified neurocognitive effects. The UK Biobank dataset included cognitive and neuroimaging data (N = 20,314), including 1012 T2DM and 19,302 HCs, aged between 50 and 80 years. Duration of T2DM ranged from 0 to 31 years (mean 8.5 \u00b1 6.1 years); 498 were treated with metformin alone, while 352 were unmedicated. Our meta-analysis evaluated 34 cognitive studies (N = 22,231) and 60 neuroimaging studies: 30 of T2DM (N = 866) and 30 of aging (N = 1088). Compared to age, sex, education, and hypertension-matched HC, T2DM was associated with marked cognitive deficits, particularly in  The neurocognitive impact of T2DM suggests marked acceleration of normal brain aging. T2DM gray matter atrophy occurred approximately 26% \u00b1 14% faster than seen with normal aging; disease duration was associated with increased neurodegeneration.

The UK Biobank dataset included cognitive and neuroimaging data (N = 20,314), including 1012 T2DM and 19,302 HCs, aged between 50 and 80 years. Duration of T2DM ranged from 0 to 31 years (mean 8.5 \\u00b1 6.1 years); 498 were treated with metformin alone, while 352 were unmedicated. Our meta-analysis evaluated 34 cognitive studies (N = 22,231) and 60 neuroimaging studies: 30 of T2DM (N = 866) and 30 of aging (N = 1088). Compared to age, sex, education, and hypertension-matched HC, T2DM was associated with marked cognitive deficits, particularly in  The neurocognitive impact of T2DM suggests marked acceleration of normal brain aging. T2DM gray matter atrophy occurred approximately 26% \\u00b1 14% faster than seen with normal aging; disease duration was associated with increased neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, our results suggest a neurometabolic component to brain aging. Clinically, neuroimaging-based biomarkers may provide a valuable adjunctive measure of T2DM progression and treatment efficacy based on neurological effects.

The increase in the number of neuroimaging studies has greatly expanded our knowledge of the neural bases of facial emotion processing in both conditions. However, to date, SAD and WS have not been compared. We conducted a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comparing SAD and WS cases to healthy control participants (HC) using facial emotion processing paradigms. Two researchers conducted comprehensive PubMed\/Medline searches to identify all fMRI studies of facial emotion processing in SAD and WS. The following search key-words were used: \"emotion processing\"; \"facial emotion\"; \"social anxiety\"; \"social phobia\"; \"Williams syndrome\"; \"neuroimaging\"; \"functional magnetic resonance\"; \"fMRI\" and their combinations, as well as terms specifying individual facial emotions. We extracted spatial coordinates from each study and conducted two separate voxel-wise activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses, one for SAD and one for WS. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 studies of SAD and five of WS. We found evidence for both common and distinct patterns of neural activation. Limbic engagement was common to SAD and WS during facial emotion processing, although we observed opposite patterns of activation for each disorder. Compared to HC, SAD cases showed hyperactivation of the amygdala, the parahippocampal gyrus and the globus pallidus. Compared to controls, participants with WS showed hypoactivation of these regions.

We conducted a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comparing SAD and WS cases to healthy control participants (HC) using facial emotion processing paradigms. Two researchers conducted comprehensive PubMed\/Medline searches to identify all fMRI studies of facial emotion processing in SAD and WS. The following search key-words were used: \\\"emotion processing\\\"; \\\"facial emotion\\\"; \\\"social anxiety\\\"; \\\"social phobia\\\"; \\\"Williams syndrome\\\"; \\\"neuroimaging\\\"; \\\"functional magnetic resonance\\\"; \\\"fMRI\\\" and their combinations, as well as terms specifying individual facial emotions. We extracted spatial coordinates from each study and conducted two separate voxel-wise activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses, one for SAD and one for WS. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 studies of SAD and five of WS. We found evidence for both common and distinct patterns of neural activation. Limbic engagement was common to SAD and WS during facial emotion processing, although we observed opposite patterns of activation for each disorder. Compared to HC, SAD cases showed hyperactivation of the amygdala, the parahippocampal gyrus and the globus pallidus. Compared to controls, participants with WS showed hypoactivation of these regions. Differential activation in a number of regions specific to either condition was also identified: SAD cases exhibited greater activation of the insula, putamen, the superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal regions and the cuneus, while WS subjects showed decreased activation in the inferior region of the parietal lobule.

Analogical reasoning has been studied using various tasks that have generally required the consideration of the relationships between objects and their integration to infer an analogy schema.

The aim of this study was to identify the cerebral network involved in analogical reasoning and its specialization based on the domains of information and task specificity. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 27 experiments that used analogical reasoning tasks. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was one of the regions most consistently activated across the studies. A comparison between semantic and visuospatial analogy tasks showed both domain-oriented regions in the inferior and middle frontal gyri and a domain-general region, the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, which was specialized for analogy tasks. A comparison of visuospatial analogy to matrix problem tasks revealed that these two relational reasoning tasks engage, at least in part, distinct right and left cerebral networks, particularly separate areas within the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings highlight several cognitive and cerebral differences between relational reasoning tasks that can allow us to make predictions about the respective roles of distinct brain regions or networks.

Up to 50\u00a0% of all cases suffer from onset in childhood or adolescence, and the disorder often takes a chronic course with a poor long-term prognosis. Paediatric OCD, with its high familiality, is often referred to as a distinct OCD subtype that coincides with a developmental period in which the prefrontal cortex exhibits extensive structural and functional maturation.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have probed the neural basis of this emotional enhancement effect on encoding processes, while relatively fewer studies have examined retrieval. Neuroimaging meta-analysis methods can summarize the brain regions associated with emotional episodic memory that are consistently activated across multiple studies. A previous ALE (Activation Likelihood Estimation) meta-analysis identified consistent activations associated with successful encoding of episodic emotional memory in the amygdala, hippocampus, and in multiple neocortical regions (Murty et al., 2010). However, since that study, meta-analysis methods have improved, and many new relevant neuroimaging studies have been published. Moreover, although qualitative reviews have summarized brain activations related to the successful retrieval of emotional episodic memory, no corresponding quantitative meta-analyses have yet been reported. Here we conducted neuroimaging meta-analyses of successful emotional memory encoding and rretrieval using Seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Relevant neuroimaging studies reporting whole-brain fMRI correlates of successful encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memory were selected for analysis. For successful emotional memory encoding, SDM activations were found bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), bilaterally in visual processing regions (middle temporal, gyrus, fusiform gyrus and occipital cortex) and bilaterally in the temporal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, putamen, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri.

However, previous studies present inconsistent results regarding the topographical organization of the DMN in aMCI. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative, voxel-wise meta-analysis of resting-state ICA studies using Seed-based d Mapping to establish the most consistent pattern of DMN functional connectivity alterations in aMCI. Twenty studies, comprising 23 independent datasets involving 535 patients and 586 healthy controls, met the inclusion criteria.

However, to date there is no review and meta-analysis of this work. We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in HIV-infected individuals using a well validated tool recently developed for use in fMRI, 'GingerALE'. Twenty-one studies (468 HIV+, 270 HIV- controls) were qualitatively reviewed, of which six (105 HIV+, 102 controls) utilized fMRI paradigms engaging the fronto-striatal-parietal network, making a quantitative analysis possible.

Compared with the healthy control group, when neuroimaging studies were combined with ReHo, ICA, and DC measurements, the brain activity of the right Rolandic operculum, right supramarginal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus in T2DM patients decreased significantly. When neuroimaging studies were combined with ALFF and CBF measurements, there was no clear evidence of differences in the brain function between T2DM and HCs. T2DM patients have a series of spontaneous abnormal brain activities, mainly involving brain regions related to learning, memory, and emotion, which provide early biomarkers for clarifying the mechanism of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders in diabetes. https:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/prospero\/display_record.php?RecordID=247071, PROSPERO [CRD42021247071]. \", \"authors\": \"Li, Ze-Yang and Ma, Teng and Yu, Ying and Hu, Bo and Han, Yu and Xie, Hao and Ni, Min-Hua and Chen, Zhu-Hong and Zhang, Yang-Ming and Huang, Yu-Xiang and Li, Wen-Hua and Wang, Wen and Yan, Lin-Feng and Cui, Guang-Bin\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36090859\">36090859<\/a>","list_title":"PMID36090859 Changes of brain function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus measured by different analysis methods: A new coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging."}

Numerous imaging studies have demonstrated brain changes in schizophrenia, particularly aberrant intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of ongoing brain activity, measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and aberrant gray matter volume (GMV) of distributed brain regions, measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging. It is unclear, however, which iFC changes are specific to schizophrenia compared with those of other disorders and whether such specific iFC changes converge with GMV changes. To address this question of specific substantial dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, we performed a transdiagnostic multimodal meta-analysis of resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging studies in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Multiple databases were searched up to June 2017 for whole-brain seed-based iFC studies and voxel-based morphometry studies in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, addiction, and anxiety. Coordinate-based meta-analyses were performed to detect 1) schizophrenia-specific hyperconnectivity or hypoconnectivity of intrinsic brain networks (compared with hyperconnectivity or hypoconnectivity of each other disorder both separately and combined across comparisons) and 2) the overlap between dysconnectivity and GMV changes (via multimodal conjunction analysis). For iFC meta-analysis, 173 publications comprising 4962 patients and 4575 control subjects were included, and for GMV meta-analysis, 127 publications comprising 6311 patients and 6745 control subjects were included.

The databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published from inception to August 24, 2018, without any language restriction. Sixteen independent studies comprising 356 MDMA users and 311 controls were included. Of these, five studies investigated frontal and occipital N-acetylaspartate\/creatine and myo-inositol\/creatine ratios, three studies assessed basal ganglia blood flow and ten studies investigated serotonin transporter (SERT) density in various regions. We found significantly decreased SERT density in eight of 13 investigated regions. Meta-regression indicated a positive association with abstinence, but none with lifetime episodes of use. Therefore, other variables (such as doses taken per occasion) might be more important determinants.

Sixteen independent studies comprising 356 MDMA users and 311 controls were included. Of these, five studies investigated frontal and occipital N-acetylaspartate\/creatine and myo-inositol\/creatine ratios, three studies assessed basal ganglia blood flow and ten studies investigated serotonin transporter (SERT) density in various regions. We found significantly decreased SERT density in eight of 13 investigated regions. Meta-regression indicated a positive association with abstinence, but none with lifetime episodes of use.

Eighty-six independent VBM (1533 ADHD and 1295 controls; 1445 ASD and 1477 controls) and 60 fMRI datasets (1001 ADHD and 1004 controls; 335 ASD and 353 controls) were identified. The VBM meta-analyses revealed ADHD-differentiating decreased ventromedial orbitofrontal (z = 2.22, p < 0.0001) but ASD-differentiating increased bilateral temporal and right dorsolateral prefrontal GMV (zs \\u2a7e 1.64, ps \\u2a7d 0.002). The fMRI meta-analyses of cognitive control revealed ASD-differentiating medial prefrontal underactivation but overactivation in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and precuneus (zs \\u2a7e 1.04, ps \\u2a7d 0.003). During motor response inhibition specifically, ADHD relative to ASD showed right inferior fronto-striatal underactivation (zs \\u2a7e 1.14, ps \\u2a7d 0.003) but shared right anterior insula underactivation. People with ADHD and ASD have mostly distinct structural abnormalities, with enlarged fronto-temporal GMV in ASD and reduced orbitofrontal GMV in ADHD; and mostly distinct functional abnormalities, which were more pronounced in ASD. \", \"authors\": \"Lukito, Steve and Norman, Luke and Carlisi, Christina and Radua, Joaquim and Hart, Heledd and Simonoff, Emily and Rubia, Katya\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32216846\">32216846<\/a>","list_title":"PMID32216846 Comparative meta-analyses of brain structural and functional abnormalities during cognitive control in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder."}

As more investigations on Chinese character processing have recently become available, we applied a meta-analytic approach to summarize previous findings and examined the neural networks for orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing of Chinese characters independently. The activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method was used to analyze eight studies in the orthographic task category, eleven in the phonological and fifteen in the semantic task categories.

English articles published up to April 30, 2023 were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. We included randomized controlled trials where resting-state fMRI was used to observe the effect of NIBS in patients with MCI or AD. RevMan software was used to analyze the continuous variables, and SDM-PSI software was used to perform an fMRI data analysis. A total of 17 studies comprising 258 patients in the treatment group and 256 in the control group were included. After NIBS, MCI patients in the treatment group showed hyperactivation in the right precuneus and decreased activity in the left cuneus and right supplementary motor area. In contrast, patients in the control group showed decreased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus and no hyperactivation.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of 11 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of timing in ADHD, comprising 150 patients and 145 healthy controls. Peak coordinates were extracted from significant case-control activation differences as well as demographic, clinical, and methodological variables. In addition, meta-regression analyses were used to explore medication effects.

These results suggest that viewing paintings engages not only systems involved in visual representation and object recognition, but also structures underlying emotions and internalized cognitions. \", \"authors\": \"Vartanian, Oshin and Skov, Martin\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/24704947\">24704947<\/a>","list_title":"PMID24704947 Neural correlates of viewing paintings: evidence from a quantitative meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data."}

Over the last fifteen years, activity patterns underlying a variety of perceptual features and objects have been decoded from the brains of participants in fMRI scans. Through a novel multi-study meta-analysis, we have analyzed and modeled relations between decoding strength in the visual ventral stream, and stimulus and methodological variables that differ across studies.

Adolescence and emerging adulthood are periods of heightened risk for psychopathology associated with emotion dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental mechanisms have been proposed to account for this increased risk. However, progress in understanding these mechanisms has been hampered by an incomplete knowledge of the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation during development.

However, cue reactivity to drug rewards can also elicit craving in addicted subjects. The degree to which drug and natural rewards share neural substrates is not known. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on drug, gambling and natural stimuli (food and sex) to identify the common and distinct neural substrates of cue reactivity to drug and natural rewards. Neural cue reactivity studies were selected for the meta-analysis by means of activation likelihood estimations, followed by sensitivity and clustering analyses of averaged neuronal response patterns. Data from 176 studies (5573 individuals) suggests largely overlapping neural response patterns towards all tested reward modalities.

Based on over 200 fMRI studies, this analysis demonstrates that the mirror system - consisting of the anterior intraparietal sulcus and the premotor cortex - is engaged when one perceives articulated motions of body parts irrespective of their sensory (visual or auditory) or verbal format as well as when the perceiver executes them. This confirms the matching role of the mirror system in understanding biological action. Observation of whole-body motions and gaze engage the posterior superior temporal sulcus and most likely reflects an orientation response in line with the action or attention of the observed actor. In contrast, the mentalizing system - consisting of the temporo-parietal junction, the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus - is activated when behavior that enables inferences to be made about goals, beliefs or moral issues is presented in abstract terms (e.g., verbal stories or geometric shapes) and there is no perceivable biological motion of body parts. A striking overlap of brain activity at the temporo-parietal junction between social inferences and other, non-social observations (e.g., Posner's cuing task) suggests that this area computes the orientation or direction of the behavior in order to predict its likely end-state (or goal). No conclusions are drawn about the specific functionality of the precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Because the mirror and mentalizing systems are rarely concurrently active, it appears that neither system subserves the other. Rather, they are complementary.

Antidepressants increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC), a key region mediating emotion regulation, during both negative and positive emotions in patients. Repeated antidepressant administration decreased brain responses to positive emotions in the nucleus accumbens, putamen, medial prefrontal and midbrain in healthy volunteers. Antidepressants act to normalize abnormal neural responses in depressed patients by increasing brain activity to positive stimuli and decreasing activity to negative stimuli in the emotional network, and increasing engagement of the regulatory mechanism in dlPFC. \", \"authors\": \"Ma, Y\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/24662929\">24662929<\/a>","list_title":"PMID24662929 Neuropsychological mechanism underlying antidepressant effect: a systematic meta-analysis."}

However, the effectiveness of these techniques on depressive symptomatology is still controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Two different strings were considered for each of the two objectives of the study: A first group comprising studies patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and a second group including studies targeting depressive symptomatology reduction in other mental or medical conditions. In the first group of studies including patients with MDD, the within-group analyses yielded an effect size of Hedges' g = 0.717, while the between-group analysis an effect size of Hedges' g = 1.050. Moderator analyses indicate that treatment efficacy is only significant when accounting for experimental design, in favor of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison to non RCTs, whereas the type of neurofeedback, trial design, year of publication, number of sessions, age, sex and quality of study did not influence treatment efficacy. In the second group of studies, a small but significant effect between groups was found (Hedges' g = 0.303) in favor of bio- and neurofeedback against control groups.

To review the existing evidence systematically, we performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies investigating upper limb movement-related brain activity after stroke. Twenty-four studies using sensorimotor tasks in standardized coordinates were included, totaling 255 patients and 145 healthy controls. Across the entire brain, we compared task-related activity patterns in good and poor recovery and assessed the magnitude of spatial shifts in sensorimotor activity in cortical motor areas after stroke. When compared with healthy controls, patients showed higher activation likelihood estimation values in contralesional primary motor soon after stroke that abated with time, but were not related to motor outcome. The observed activity changes were consistent with restoration of typical interhemispheric balance. In contrast, activation likelihood estimation values in ipsilesional medial-premotor and primary motor cortex were associated with good outcome, reorganization that may reflect vicarious processes associated with ventral activity shifts from BA4a to 4p.

Across the entire brain, we compared task-related activity patterns in good and poor recovery and assessed the magnitude of spatial shifts in sensorimotor activity in cortical motor areas after stroke. When compared with healthy controls, patients showed higher activation likelihood estimation values in contralesional primary motor soon after stroke that abated with time, but were not related to motor outcome. The observed activity changes were consistent with restoration of typical interhemispheric balance. In contrast, activation likelihood estimation values in ipsilesional medial-premotor and primary motor cortex were associated with good outcome, reorganization that may reflect vicarious processes associated with ventral activity shifts from BA4a to 4p.

The role of neuroplastic brain changes is more evident than the peripheral factors in the maintenance, modulation and amplification of chronic low back pain (cLBP). In this background, we summarise the brain changes in cLBP in a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Databases ('PubMed', 'Scopus' and 'Sleuth') were searched till May 2022 and the activity pattern was noted under the 'without stimulation' and 'with stimulation' groups. A total of 312 studies were selected after removing duplicates. Seventeen (553 cLBP patients, 192 activation foci) studies were fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included in the 'without stimulation' group. Twelve statistically significant clusters are localized in the prefrontal cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus amygdala, occipital lobe, temporal lobe and associated white matter in this group. Ten studies (353 cLBP patients, 125 activation foci) were selected in the' with stimulation' groups.

To test the hypothesis of distinct neural correlates for self- and external-agency attribution a quantitative meta-analysis, based on activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method, across 15 PET and fMRI studies (228 subjects) was conducted. Results show converging activations including the TPJ, pre-SMA, precuneus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) in external-agency, while insula activation was related to self-agency. We discuss these findings, highlighting the role of the insula, and calling for the use of alternative paradigms such as intentional binding and interactive imitation to study agency. \", \"authors\": \"Sperduti, Marco and Delaveau, Pauline and Fossati, Philippe and Nadel, Jaqueline\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21212978\">21212978<\/a>","list_title":"PMID21212978 Different brain structures related to self- and external-agency attribution: a brief review and meta-analysis."}

Overlap analysis identified unique functional coincidence between DD and WM. The anterior cingulate cortex was engaged by all tasks. Finger tapping largely engaged motor-related brain areas. In addition to motor-related areas, RI engaged frontal brain regions. The right lateral prefrontal cortex was engaged by RI, DD, and WM and was contrasted out of overlap maps. A functional cluster in the posterior portion of the left lateral prefrontal cortex emerged as the largest location of unique overlap between DD and WM. A portion of the left lateral prefrontal cortex is a unique location where delay discounting and working memory processes overlap in the brain. This area, therefore, represents a therapeutic target for improving behaviors that rely on the integration of the recent past with the foreseeable future. \", \"authors\": \"Wesley, Michael J and Bickel, Warren K\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/24041504\">24041504<\/a>","list_title":"PMID24041504 Remember the future II: meta-analyses and functional overlap of working memory and delay discounting."}

Although extensive research has been conducted to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) underlying these unique impairments, previous models are heterogeneous and may be further clarified based on their structural connectivity, which has been far less described. The goal of this research is to propose an anatomically concise network model for the neurophysiologic basis of IMA, specific to the voluntary pantomime, imitation and tool execution, based on intrinsic white matter connectivity. We utilized meta-analytic software to identify relevant ROIs in ideomotor apraxia as reported in the literature based on functional neuroimaging data with healthy participants. After generating an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of relevant ROIs, cortical parcellations overlapping the ALE were used to construct an anatomically precise model of anatomic substrates using the parcellation scheme outlined by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Deterministic tractography was then performed on 25 randomly selected, healthy HCP subjects to determine the structural connectivity underlying the identified ROIs. 10 task-based fMRI studies met our inclusion criteria and the ALE analysis demonstrated 6 ROIs to constitute the IMA network: SCEF, FOP4, MIP, AIP, 7AL, and 7PC. These parcellations represent a fronto-parietal network consisting mainly of intra-parietal, U-shaped association fibers (40%) and long-range inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) fibers (50%). These findings support previous functional models based on dual-stream motor processing.

Although extensive research has been conducted to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) underlying these unique impairments, previous models are heterogeneous and may be further clarified based on their structural connectivity, which has been far less described. The goal of this research is to propose an anatomically concise network model for the neurophysiologic basis of IMA, specific to the voluntary pantomime, imitation and tool execution, based on intrinsic white matter connectivity. We utilized meta-analytic software to identify relevant ROIs in ideomotor apraxia as reported in the literature based on functional neuroimaging data with healthy participants. After generating an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of relevant ROIs, cortical parcellations overlapping the ALE were used to construct an anatomically precise model of anatomic substrates using the parcellation scheme outlined by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Deterministic tractography was then performed on 25 randomly selected, healthy HCP subjects to determine the structural connectivity underlying the identified ROIs. 10 task-based fMRI studies met our inclusion criteria and the ALE analysis demonstrated 6 ROIs to constitute the IMA network: SCEF, FOP4, MIP, AIP, 7AL, and 7PC. These parcellations represent a fronto-parietal network consisting mainly of intra-parietal, U-shaped association fibers (40%) and long-range inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) fibers (50%). These findings support previous functional models based on dual-stream motor processing.

We aimed to determine, via meta-analysis, agreement between the two tests and identify predictors of disagreement. We performed a systematic search for studies comparing WT and fMRI for memory lateralization with individual-patient data. If results were provided as laterality indexes instead of hemispheric lateralization, the cutoff point for memory lateralization was set to the usual \u00b12 for WT and \u00b10.20 for fMRI. We also evaluated results at our Epilepsy Center. Seven published series plus our own were included, comprising 124 patients. Wada test was performed by recognizing objects in half of the studies, and scenes, drawings, and words in the rest. All used scenes or pictures encoding for fMRI. Wada test-fMRI agreement across the studies ranged from 21.1 to 100%, averaging 46.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.6-56.0%). When cases with bilateral memory in either test were excluded, agreement reached 78.7% (95% CI: 67.6-89.8%), and concordance with contralateral TLE foci 86.4% for the WT and 83.0% for fMRI. Higher agreement was associated with using multiple items during WT (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and higher disagreement with presence of a lesion on MRI (p\u202f=\u202f0.024).

This approach characterized by higher sensitivity may produce inflated results, particularly when findings are aggregated in meta-analytic maps. Here, we conducted a systematic review and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on SP, testing the impact of the inclusion of ROI-based studies. ALE meta-analyses were carried out either including ROI-based results or focusing on whole-brain voxelwise studies exclusively. To assess the risk of bias in the neuroimaging field, we modified the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and measured the reliability of fMRI findings. Of the 31 selected investigations (564 patients and 485 controls) one-third did not motivate ROI selection: five studies did not report an explicit rationale, whereas four did not cite any specific reference in this regard. Analyses including ROI-based studies revealed differences between phobics and healthy subjects in several regions of the limbic circuit. However, when focusing on whole-brain analysis, only the anterior midcingulate cortex differentiated SP from controls.

Although there are some reviews of previous neuroimaging studies on appetitive behaviors, the findings on neural activation in response to pictures of high- and low-calorie foods seem inconsistent. This study aims to systematically review, integrate, and meta-analyze neuroimaging evidence of viewing high- and low-calorie foods. There were 25 samples from 24 studies, totalizing 489 normal-weight participants (311 female, 160 male, and 18 of unknown sex).

In the subgroup analysis, patients with first-episode schizophrenia demonstrated decreased ALFF in the bilateral inferior parietal gyri, right precuneus and left medial prefrontal cortex, and increased ALFF in the bilateral putamen and bilateral occipital gyrus. Patients with chronic schizophrenia showed decreased ALFF in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, left precuneus and right occipital gyrus, and increased ALFF in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, left amygdala, left inferior temporal gyrus, right anterior cingulate cortex and left insula. The small sample size of our subgroup analysis, predominantly Asian samples, processing steps and publication bias could have limited the accuracy of the results. Our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that findings of aberrant regional intrinsic brain activity during the initial stages of schizophrenia, and much more widespread damage with the progression of disease, may contribute to our understanding of the progressive pathophysiology of schizophrenia. \", \"authors\": \"Gong, Jiaying and Wang, Junjing and Luo, Xiaomei and Chen, Guanmao and Huang, Huiyuan and Huang, Ruiwang and Huang, Li and Wang, Ying\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31580042\">31580042<\/a>","list_title":"PMID31580042 Abnormalities of intrinsic regional brain activity in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of resting-state functional MRI."}

Due to its complexity, the neuropsychological processes that give birth to successful intentional forgetting are not yet clearly known. In this study, we used two different meta-analytic algorithms, Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) & Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to quantitatively assess the neural correlates of IF and to evaluate the degree of compatibility between the proposed neurobiological models and the existing brain imaging data. We found that IF involves the interaction of two networks, the main \"core regions\" consisting of a primarily right-lateralized frontal-parietal circuit that is activated irrespective of the paradigm used and sample characteristics and a second less constrained \"supportive network\" that involves frontal-hippocampal interactions when IF takes place.

However, results from functional neuroimaging studies using negative emotional stimuli have failed to confirm this assumption. One of the potential reasons for the lack of effect is that study participants with psychosis may display aberrant brain responses to neutral material rather than to threatening stimuli. The authors conducted a functional neuroimaging meta-analysis to test this hypothesis. A literature search was performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase to identify functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to neutral material in patients with psychosis.

Patients with ADHD showed disorder-contrasting multimodal structural (left z\\u2009=\\u20091.904, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; right z\\u2009=\\u20091.738, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) and functional (left z\\u2009=\\u20091.447, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; right z\\u2009=\\u20091.229, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) abnormalities in bilateral basal ganglia\/insula, which were decreased in GMV and function in patients with ADHD relative to those with OCD (and controls). In OCD patients, they were enhanced relative to controls. Patients with OCD showed disorder-specific reduced function and structure in rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate\/medial prefrontal cortex (fMRI z\\u2009=\\u20092.113, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; VBM z\\u2009=\\u20091.622, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001), whereas patients with ADHD showed disorder-specific underactivation predominantly in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (z\\u2009=\\u20091.229, P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Ventromedial prefrontal GMV reduction was shared in both disorders relative to controls. Shared impairments in inhibitory control, rather than representing a transdiagnostic endophenotype in ADHD and OCD, were associated with disorder-differential functional and structural abnormalities. Patients with ADHD showed smaller and underfunctioning ventrolateral prefrontal\/insular-striatal regions whereas patients with OCD showed larger and hyperfunctioning insular-striatal regions that may be poorly controlled by smaller and underfunctioning rostro\/dorsal medial prefrontal regions. \", \"authors\": \"Norman, Luke J and Carlisi, Christina and Lukito, Steve and Hart, Heledd and Mataix-Cols, David and Radua, Joaquim and Rubia, Katya\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27276220\">27276220<\/a>","list_title":"PMID27276220 Structural and Functional Brain Abnormalities in Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Comparative Meta-analysis."}

However, less is known about the aging motor system. Several studies have contrasted movement-related activity in older versus young adults, but there is inconsistency among their findings. To address this, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on within-group data from older adults and young adults performing regularly paced right-hand finger movement tasks in response to external stimuli. We hypothesized that older adults would show a greater likelihood of activation in right cortical motor areas (i.e., ipsilateral to the side of movement) compared to young adults. ALE maps were examined for conjunction and between-group differences.

In recent years, many acupuncture brain imaging studies have found significant changes in brain function following acupuncture treatment of migraine, providing a new perspective to elucidate the mechanism of action of acupuncture. To analyse and summarize the effects of acupuncture on the modulation of specific patterns of brain region activity changes in migraine patients, thus providing a mechanism for treating migraine by acupuncture. Chinese and English articles published up to May 2022 were searched in three English databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane) and four Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure, CNKI; Chinese Biomedical Literature database, CBM; the Chongqing VIP database, VIP; and the Wanfang database, WF). A neuroimaging meta-analysis on ALFF, ReHo was performed on the included studies using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) software. Subgroup analyses were used to compare differences in brain regions between acupuncture and other groups. Meta-regression was used to explore the effect of demographic information and migraine alterations on brain imaging outcomes. Linear models were drawn using MATLAB 2018a, and visual graphs for quality evaluation were produced using R and RStudio software. A total of 7 studies comprising 236 patients in the treatment group and 173 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment helps to improve pain symptoms in patients with migraine. The left angular gyrus is hyperactivation, and the left superior frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus are hypoactivated. The migraine group showed hyperactivation in the corpus callosum compared to healthy controls. Acupuncture can significantly regulate changes in brain regions in migraine patients.

In recent years, many acupuncture brain imaging studies have found significant changes in brain function following acupuncture treatment of migraine, providing a new perspective to elucidate the mechanism of action of acupuncture. To analyse and summarize the effects of acupuncture on the modulation of specific patterns of brain region activity changes in migraine patients, thus providing a mechanism for treating migraine by acupuncture. Chinese and English articles published up to May 2022 were searched in three English databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane) and four Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure, CNKI; Chinese Biomedical Literature database, CBM; the Chongqing VIP database, VIP; and the Wanfang database, WF). A neuroimaging meta-analysis on ALFF, ReHo was performed on the included studies using Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) software. Subgroup analyses were used to compare differences in brain regions between acupuncture and other groups. Meta-regression was used to explore the effect of demographic information and migraine alterations on brain imaging outcomes. Linear models were drawn using MATLAB 2018a, and visual graphs for quality evaluation were produced using R and RStudio software. A total of 7 studies comprising 236 patients in the treatment group and 173 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment helps to improve pain symptoms in patients with migraine. The left angular gyrus is hyperactivation, and the left superior frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus are hypoactivated. The migraine group showed hyperactivation in the corpus callosum compared to healthy controls. Acupuncture can significantly regulate changes in brain regions in migraine patients. However, due to the experimental design of neuroimaging standards are not uniform, the results also have some bias. Therefore, to better understand the potential mechanism of acupuncture on migraine, a large sample, multicenter controlled trial is needed for further study.

In total, 21 pediatric studies, 73 adult studies, and 2 studies containing distinct pediatric and adult groups within the same study met inclusion criteria for our ALE analyses. Coordinates of significant between-group differences were extracted from each published study. Recent improvements in GingerALE software were used to perform direct comparisons of pediatric and adult fMRI findings. We conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses directly comparing the voxelwise convergence of fMRI findings in BD-youths vs BD-adults, both relative to healthy control (HC) participants. Analyses of emotional face recognition fMRI studies showed significantly greater convergence of amygdala hyperactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults. More broadly, analyses of fMRI studies using emotional stimuli showed significantly greater convergence of hyperactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults in the inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus. In contrast, analyses of fMRI studies using nonemotional cognitive tasks and analyses aggregating emotional and nonemotional tasks showed significantly greater convergence of hypoactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults in the anterior cingulate cortex. Our data suggest that amygdala, prefrontal, and visual system hyperactivation is important in the emotional dysfunction present in BD-youths, as well as that anterior cingulate cortex hypoactivation is relevant to the cognitive deficits in BD-youths. Future studies are required to determine if the developmental fMRI differences between BD-youths and BD-adults identified by our ALE meta-analyses are useful as brain-based diagnostic or treatment markers of BD, including either longitudinal neuroimaging studies of BD-youths as they become adults or cross-sectional imaging studies directly comparing BD-youths with BD-adults. \n","metadata":"{\"pmid\": \"25100166\", \"journal\": \"JAMA psychiatry\", \"publication_year\": \"2014\", \"title\": \"Developmental meta-analyses of the functional neural correlates of bipolar disorder.\", \"keywords\": \"\", \"abstract\": \"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating mental illness associated with high costs to diagnosed individuals and society.

Future studies are required to determine if the developmental fMRI differences between BD-youths and BD-adults identified by our ALE meta-analyses are useful as brain-based diagnostic or treatment markers of BD, including either longitudinal neuroimaging studies of BD-youths as they become adults or cross-sectional imaging studies directly comparing BD-youths with BD-adults. \", \"authors\": \"Wegbreit, Ezra and Cushman, Grace K and Puzia, Megan E and Weissman, Alexandra B and Kim, Kerri L and Laird, Angela R and Dickstein, Daniel P\"}","display_title":"pmid: <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25100166\">25100166<\/a>","list_title":"PMID25100166 Developmental meta-analyses of the functional neural correlates of bipolar disorder."}

The aim was to establish the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) of taste-mediated regional activation across the whole brain. Apart from one meta-analysis for all studies in general, three analyses were performed to reveal the clusters of activation that were attributable to processing the affective value (data from 323 foci), intensity (data from 43 foci) and quality (data from 45 foci) of taste. The ALE revealed eight clusters of activation outside the insula for processing affective value, covering the middle and posterior cingulate, pre-\/post-central gyrus, caudate and thalamus. The affective value had four clusters of activation (two in each hemisphere) in the insula. The intensity and quality activated only the insula, each with one cluster on the right. The concurrence between studies was moderate; at best, 53% of the experiments contributed to the significant clusters attributable to the affective value, 60% to intensity and 50% to quality. The affective value was processed bilaterally in the anterior to middle insula, whereas intensity was processed in the right antero-middle insula, and quality was processed in the right middle insula. The right middle dorsal insula was responsible for processing both the affective value and quality of taste. The exploratory analysis on taste quality did not have a significant result if the studies using liquid food stimuli were excluded.

However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of reward processing have yielded mixed results. To examine whether individuals with ASD process rewarding stimuli differently than typically developing individuals (controls), whether differences are limited to social rewards, and whether contradictory findings in the literature might be due to sample characteristics. Articles were identified in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO from database inception until June 1, 2017. Functional MRI data from these articles were provided by most authors. Publications were included that provided brain activation contrasts between a sample with ASD and controls on a reward task, determined by multiple reviewer consensus. When fMRI data were not provided by authors, multiple reviewers extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes from articles to recreate statistical maps using seed-based d mapping software. Random-effects meta-analyses of responses to social, nonsocial, and restricted interest stimuli, as well as all of these domains together, were performed.

Several studies have found abnormal brain activation in patients with schizophrenia during social cognition tasks. Nevertheless, no coordinate-based meta-analysis comparing the neural correlates of theory of mind and empathy had been done in this population. Our aim was to explore neural correlates related to theory of mind and empathy in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, in order to identify abnormal brain activation related to emotional content during mental state attribution in schizophrenia. We performed a neural-coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of existing neuroimaging data in the literature to distinguish between abnormal brain maps associated with emotional attribution and those associated with intention\/belief inference. We found that brain activation in patients group was significantly decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during emotional attribution, while there was a significant decrease in the left posterior temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during intention\/belief attribution.

We performed a neural-coordinate-based Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of existing neuroimaging data in the literature to distinguish between abnormal brain maps associated with emotional attribution and those associated with intention\/belief inference. We found that brain activation in patients group was significantly decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during emotional attribution, while there was a significant decrease in the left posterior temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during intention\/belief attribution.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in ADHD during inhibition and attention tasks, exploring age and long-term stimulant medication use effects. DATA SOURCES PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were searched up to May 2012 for meta-analyses. Meta-regression methods explored age and long-term stimulant medication use effects.

DATA EXTRACTION Peak coordinates of clusters of significant group differences, as well as demographic, clinical, and methodological variables, were extracted for each study or were obtained from the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS Patients with ADHD relative to controls showed reduced activation for inhibition in the right inferior frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as striato-thalamic areas, and showed reduced activation for attention in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior basal ganglia, and thalamic and parietal regions. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis for the attention domain showed that long-term stimulant medication use was associated with more similar right caudate activation relative to controls. Age effects could be analyzed only for the inhibition meta-analysis, showing that the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia were underactivated solely in children with ADHD relative to controls, while the inferior frontal cortex and thalamus were underactivated solely in adults with ADHD relative to controls.
